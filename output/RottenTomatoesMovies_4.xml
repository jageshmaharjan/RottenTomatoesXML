        <StoryLine>Named for the question Mattiesko Wuopio gets every time he says his name, Mr. What has spent 22 years in prison for a crime he didn't commit. Upon apprehension of the true culprit, he's released, only to face harassment and the jailbird stigma as he attempts to re-enter society in tiny Tecumseh, Michigan. Meanwhile, Mr. What seeks redemption through his ailing father, who is beset with Alzheimer's disease, a neighbor boy without friends or a father who cares, and a stray dog. In the end, a miracle proves that God is never far out of reach for those in need of a little healing.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Yes, breasts are a beautiful, natural, baby-nourishing thing, and they've been bizarrely shamed and oversexualized in American culture-but writer-director Lina Esco's amateurish debut is not the film to set them free.</Review>
            <Review>"Free the Nipple" is a bright, scrappy satire inspired by a real-life movement to nationally legalize a woman's right to go topless in public - just like a man can.</Review>
            <Review>"Free the Nipple" is first and foremost the cinematic equivalent of a billboard.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is so tone deaf, and travels so far from its original feminist ideals, that it's painful to watch.</Review>
            <Review>It's too rare for movies to depict women working together as friends to effect political change, and this one makes it seem righteous, loud, and fun as a rock concert.</Review>
            <Review>As an attempt to promote grassroots advocacy, this low-budget drama feels shallow and takes itself too seriously. But it works just fine as an excuse to see plenty of topless women.</Review>
            <Review>Free the Nipple is more of a confusing and frustrating experience than an inspiring one...</Review>
            <Review>With's rapid and multiple changes of heart fly fast and furious in the film's first act, making it difficult to get a handle on either her motivations or her basic character.</Review>
            <Review>Free the Nipple is ... a silly little bit of fluff and, worse, a painfully amateurish piece of filmmaking.</Review>
            <Review>Its meandering storyline, poorly drawn characters and lifeless scenes are, at their best, merely predictable and bland. When things go wrong - and man, do they go wrong - it's just embarrassing.</Review>
            <Review>This is kind of didactic topical movie that distributes its rhetoric evenly between characters with clear distinction as to who's playing devil's advocate to the other one's points.</Review>

            <Review>Fascinating, funny, heroic, moving and may even make hockey fans out of nonbelievers.</Review>
            <Review>It's a mark of Polsky's ambition and canniness that he braids hockey not just with geopolitics but also with personal history and human drama.</Review>
            <Review>Polsky keeps things lively, both visually and with his editing. But the sometimes-lighthearted approach never undermines the serious business at hand.</Review>
            <Review>On the surface it's the story of one particular hockey player, but it reflects so much more.</Review>
            <Review>It's a story of global consequences and historic proportions, and of astounding athleticism and synchronicity - and filmmaker Polsky ices it.</Review>
            <Review>Wittily edited and beautifully scored, "Red Army" is not just a terrific film but an important one - even if you don't give two hoots about ice hockey.</Review>
            <Review>There's a lesson here for fans of any contemporary sport and an absolutely thrilling tale, impeccably assembled besides. Sporting glory awaits, even for those viewers who couldn't tell a jockstrap from a jellybean.</Review>
            <Review>Part of the interest in watching Red Army is in gauging the fluctuating relationship between Polsky and his chief subject: Fetisov can be distinctly laconic, appearing to give up his time and memories rather reluctantly.</Review>
            <Review>Red Army keeps a light tone even when dealing with serious issues, and is chock-full of great stock footage.</Review>
            <Review>It is fascinating viewing and this unfolds so much like a feature film it's remarkable the movie rights haven't already been snapped up. Someone call Stallone.</Review>
            <Review>Through a vivid collection of clips and interviews, this enlightening, rousing documentary shows us how these proud but cautious athletes have a complex love-hate relationship with the place they call home.</Review>
            <Review>What's really fascinating is the way the story evolves, with director Gabe Polsky following the story post-glasnost as the Russian players became viable commodities in the big-money National Hockey League.</Review>

        <StoryLine>When 61-year-old self-proclaimed loner and terminally ill, DR. CAS PEPPER, reluctantly agrees to give 22-year-old social misfit, DYLAN MORGAN, a very short lift home, the last thing he anticipates is that he will strike her angry boyfriend with his car, find himself on the lam, and ultimately drive across the country with an aspiring young writer determined to help him overcome his own bizarre case of suicide note writer's block. But as fate would have it, that is exactly what happens. Suddenly Cas's solo one-way trip out West isn't so solo. With Dylan at his side, the two take off on an adventure that will open their eyes to some of life's lessons - both big and small.(C) eOne</StoryLine>

            <Review>The story ends up being one wrong turn after another. A GPS hasn't been invented that could get this plot-hole-riddled script back on track.</Review>
            <Review>There's a full tank of clichés for the mismatched-strangers road movie "Cas &amp; Dylan," the feature directing debut of Jason Priestley, and the sputtering is cacophonous even with two gifted actors leading the way.</Review>
            <Review>This Canadian movie, from a screenplay by Jessie Gabe, begins in Winnipeg and ends in Vancouver and jounces along on the crackle of smart-aleck dialogue mouthed by its stars, Richard Dreyfuss and Tatiana Maslany.</Review>
            <Review>Leading man Richard Dreyfuss is so irrepressibly charming that he almost saves Jason Priestley's dismal buddy comedy Cas &amp; Dylan from its awkward humor and trite sentimentality.</Review>
            <Review>Cas &amp; Dylan may have big-name talent for a small Canadian movie but mainly it has tired Hollywood formulas.</Review>
            <Review>Even if Cas &amp; Dylan isn't as polished as it could be, there are still enough pleasing moments to make this road trip worth the ride.</Review>
            <Review>Great actors stuck in predictable road-trip flick.</Review>
            <Review>It is still hard to fathom why an actor of [Richard] Dreyfuss' stature would find himself in a thin, predictable and wholly contrived indie like Cas &amp; Dylan.</Review>
            <Review>If there was an original idea in Jesse Gabe's screenplay it died of loneliness long before reaching the screen.</Review>
            <Review>Former heart-throb Jason Priestley, making his feature debut as director, keeps the banter ticking along nicely as the bug transports us to a sentimental -- but genuinely touching -- conclusion.</Review>
            <Review>The film simply mucks up its earnest take on the buddy movie with undercooked characters and on-the-nose writing.</Review>
            <Review>...an earnest yet underwhelming endeavor that's hardly a cut above most garden-variety made-for-television enterprises...</Review>

            <Review>This is a well-intentioned and sometimes quite sharp high school movie that falls just short of the mark due to a few way-off-the-mark scenes and too much heavy-handed preaching.</Review>
            <Review>It's hard not to see "The Duff" becoming an instant teen classic.</Review>
            <Review>Why is it so wonderful? Because wit and charm matter, and The DUFF has a good deal of both. The cast will be stars, the gags will be immortal, and you'll still be watching this movie years from now.</Review>
            <Review>Whitman displays flawless comic timing and consistently makes inspiring choices in terms of delivery, reaction, even the slightest facial expression. She shines confidently in a self-deprecating role, and it's irresistible.</Review>
            <Review>It's not "Mean Girls." It's not even "Easy A." But it's definitely a solid B.</Review>
            <Review>It's the first great teen comedy since Mean Girls.</Review>
            <Review>Always fun to see how high school gets techno-updated. The phone-and-social-media insanity portrayed here makes the beepers of 1995's 'Clueless' look like trilobite fossils.</Review>
            <Review>The DUFF brings something different to the genre.</Review>
            <Review>An earnest high-school comedy that mostly feels like the dried-out, overheated leftovers of John Hughes.</Review>
            <Review>As she proved in Arrested Development, Whitman is great -- although without her tremendous comic skill The DUFF would be, well, duff.</Review>
            <Review>[Mae Whitman] helps elevate a predictable story into one many won't mind watching.</Review>
            <Review>It occasionally plays like a mashup of Mean Girls and Easy A, but Whitman's performance gives The DUFF a spiky energy all its own.</Review>

        <Duration>97</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Winner of the Best Documentary Prize at the Haifa International Film Festival, director Yael Reuveny's Farewell Herr Schwarz is a cinematic journey about buried family secrets, the Holocaust (from a third generation perspective) and how it is never too late to reclaim your heritage. Siblings Michla and Feiv'ke Schwarz survived the Holocaust but never reunited after the war. Michla moved to the soon-to-be-founded Jewish state in the Middle East and started a family there. Her brother Feiv'ke considered dead returned to East Germany, married a German woman and inexplicably lived amidst the concentration camp ruins where he was once a prisoner. The Israeli and German sides to the family lived unaware of each other for half a century until first time filmmaker Yael Reuveny probed exactly what happened to her family in 1945.

            <Review>An absorbing documentary that eloquently explores questions about forgiveness.</Review>

            <Review>Reuveny's film unfolds with the amorphousness of memory, her family's story told in a way so personal that it feels more like a private genealogy project than a doc fit for the public.</Review>

            <Review>Just like Arnold Schwarzenegger was told his name was too big for movie posters, Marcus Markou's inspirational debut feature film has an impossible title on purpose.</Review>

            <Review>It gets by almost wholly on hangdog charm, but that's an underrated asset, and so is Dillane, delivering a terse and rueful performance that's typically excellent.</Review>
            <Review>Likeable British recession comedy enlivened by a strong support cast and a topical, engagingly feelgood central theme, though it's slightly let down by an underwritten script and a frustrating central performance from Stephen Dillane.</Review>

            <Review>Good show, lads.</Review>
            <Review>If ever there was a semi-entertaining movie that sabotages itself with tastelessness and misogyny, this is it.</Review>
            <Review>On Day One of filming, they must have thrown away the moral compass and taken a group vow to splatter our sensibilities with stylish, gratuitous violence and one "Wait, what?!" moment after another.</Review>
            <Review>Any sense of triumph is purely at the level of stuntcraft. The rest feels less than the sum of the moving parts.</Review>
            <Review>Camping it up, Jackson is hilarious.</Review>
            <Review>The set pieces manage to be both bold and old. A bloody shoot-out set in a Kentucky church, however, is just cold.</Review>
            <Review>Kingsman's deft blend of comedy and combat render it an early contender for best action film of the year.</Review>
            <Review>Now that the old-school Bond archetype is back, we find we've missed it. No one does debonair gentleman spies better than the Brits.</Review>
            <Review>Only the impeccable Colin Firth, against type, as an action star, is worth the watch.</Review>
            <Review>Until the new Bondflick, Spectre, arrives, Vaughn's madly irreverent spin will do nicely.</Review>
            <Review>A would-be spy movie remix that revels in gratuitous violence and general ugliness without ever stopping to take stock of what it all means.</Review>
            <Review>For all of the attempts to shock all sensibilities provide a real upset to the status quo, Kingsman ultimately fails to leave its audiences shaken or stirred.</Review>

            <Review>The genre dramatizes the identity formation that goes on during the digital technology-glutted adolescent years, which are filled with screens and captured images, whether from smartphones, cameras, vlogging, or pictures on social media.</Review>
            <Review>The premise has been done to death, but screenwriters Andrew Stark and Jason Pagan give it a fresh and pleasant spin by using it as a vehicle for adolescent wish fulfillment</Review>
            <Review>Ugly, unfocused photography makes it impossible to enjoy the film beyond its theoretical novelty.</Review>
            <Review>The premise, which initially has a certain interior logic, grows implausible and then nonsensical.</Review>
            <Review>Maybe it will work better on home video where unrestrained camera movement is less likely to provoke nausea but it certainly doesn't work on a big screen.</Review>
            <Review>On the whole, this is a good B-movie that hits it modest marks.</Review>
            <Review>Maybe every time-travel movie can't use a souped-up DeLorean, but Project Almanac may leave you wanting to pull out your old copy of Back to the Future instead.</Review>
            <Review>Yet another chance to berate the found-footage genre, and I'm going to take it.</Review>
            <Review>Let's be honest -- no gimmick in cinema past, present or future could make this tripe palatable.</Review>
            <Review>This MTV Films-backed teen-romance for the GoPro-in-ADHD generation actually makes a music-fest a (creaky) plot-hinge. It's part wanna-be Primer, part energy-drink-hangover-experience.</Review>
            <Review>Aside from the last 20 minutes or so, this is a film with zero tension.</Review>
            <Review>...for a self-aware time travel flick, it does hit all the right pop-culture tropes and has fun with the idea.</Review>

            <Review>It's an odd misfire from two actors at the peak of their game, but a misfire nonetheless.</Review>
            <Review>Absolutely nothing works. No one seems to understand the place or the people. And the only thing gleaned from the lumber industry is that you can build an entire movie from performances made of wood.</Review>
            <Review>In other words, a lot of people realized they had an epic clunker on their hands.</Review>
            <Review>Given these unpromising circumstances, I was expecting something truly awful, and perhaps that might have been more fun to watch than this lugubrious period piece. The production values and the costumes are the true stars.</Review>
            <Review>A flat-out disaster, the kind of film that its cast and crew hope gets buried as quickly as possible as they race to move on to other projects.</Review>
            <Review>The actors don't just look uncomfortable in their period duds, they also look uneasy in their own skins, which is a feat for two such natural, physically confident screen performers.</Review>
            <Review>The narrative has the choppy quality of a badly bowdlerised book, and the result is not bad so much as boring - and best thought of as a tree, fallen in the forest, that nobody heard.</Review>
            <Review>When Rhys Ifans doing a Carolina accent is the best thing in your movie, well... Maybe it's time to call the whole thing off.</Review>
            <Review>Well, Serena isn't great, but it's better than the lousy reputation that precedes it.</Review>
            <Review>Serena is simply a one-off botch.</Review>
            <Review>Considering how well Cooper and Lawrence meshed in Silver Linings Playbook, Serena's inert central dynamic underlines the fact that chemistry is as much a byproduct of directorial stewardship as it is of actors' natural chemistry.</Review>
            <Review>Serena reaches its risible zenith when George confronts a Carolina panther. No, it's not Cam Newton, but such an illogical cameo wouldn't have made the movie any more of a mess.</Review>

            <Review>Between plot and character, there are definitely 18 holes in "The Squeeze."</Review>
            <Review>Within the legacy of golf movies, this subpar thriller doesn't reach the leaderboard.</Review>
            <Review>A moralizing, paint-by-numbers parable lifted right out of the Hollywood hack playbook.</Review>
            <Review>Worthy addition to the annals of golf movies and a decent gambling-caper film, marred by a subpar final act.</Review>
            <Review>Won't efface memories of the best caper pictures. Golfers, however, may well find it a pleasant diversion. At least it shouldn't tee them off.</Review>
            <Review>A third act twist renders everything null and void and seriously strains anything mildly resembling reality.</Review>
            <Review>There's a game of conscience being played alongside golf, yet "The Squeeze" never achieves urgency.</Review>
            <Review>Imagine: Death threats. A $1 million bet. And it all rests on one. Round. Of golf. There's a reason thrillers aren't set on the fairway.</Review>
            <Review>For much of its running time, it delivers a perfectly breezy, entertaining story, but then the third act trips everything up.</Review>
            <Review>Bits of characters and scenes suggest a less cheesy or more breezy movie could have resulted from this.</Review>
            <Review>'The Squeeze' boasts an opening sequence with the wildest golf action I've ever seen on screen, and the last part of the film offers lots of suspense. One of my favorite golf movies.</Review>

            <Review>This is a comedy that encourages viewers to be impulsive, and pointedly seek love and acceptance outside of "normal" social institutions, especially when it comes to family and romance.</Review>
            <Review>Mr. Borden, an acclaimed Canadian stage actor and playwright, turns in a slyly entertaining performance. But the relationship between Lake and Melvyn feels a bit more one-sided than perhaps was intended.</Review>
            <Review>There are the makings of a poignant Harold and Maude-style drama here, but the movie is so amateurish and eager to be shocking, it just winds up feeling creepy.</Review>
            <Review>Katie Boland is ... a force of nature as Lake's feminist ex - who gets off on reciting the names of her favorite female revolutionaries. But neither she nor Borden can mitigate this film's ultimately creepy premise.</Review>
            <Review>LaBruce ... [is] angling either for tragedy or an arch jab at the coldness of sexual conquest. I only wish he had let his conceit ripen long enough for us to tell.</Review>
            <Review>Better camerawork and a lower gross-out factor than usual seem to have taken the oomph out of bad boy Bruce LaBruce, whose Gerontophilia sports a great title and a funny opening before going all limp.</Review>
            <Review>As it is, it's hard to judge this as much more than a PSA for certain audience members: Hey everyone, gerontophilia is a thing that exists.</Review>
            <Review>...there's something lacking at Gerontophilia's core.</Review>
            <Review>While it gets credit for audacity, the film suffers from amateurish performances and ignores the ethical ramifications of its characters' behavior.</Review>
            <Review>Gerontophilia has the authentic feel of a little classic.</Review>
            <Review>Gerontophilia is rather reminiscent of a student film, and I don't mean that it has the fire of youth. It is restrained by a rank amateurism that borders on embarrassing.</Review>
            <Review>It may be that, in self-consciously targeting a wider audience (as LaBruce has happily confessed was his aim here), the director's lost a little of his edge in the process.</Review>

            <Review>It's so evocative on an instinctive level that its panting excitement overwhelms the sense of questions unanswered, and often unasked.</Review>
            <Review>A lucid haze of sex and violence, compellingly offbeat and irrevocably Other.</Review>
            <Review>Neither of the actors is particularly strong and some scenes are clumsily handled but this only contributes to the gutterheart sensibility of a film that is considerably more enjoyable than it ought to be.</Review>
            <Review>A queer retelling of the werewolf myth, The Samurai reveals the dark side of a character who comes out in the light of the full moon wearing women's clothing rather than an animal's skin.</Review>
            <Review>Let me just share that this is 1 of the more oddball romances you'll ever witness. Imagine George Romero directing Harold and Maude. As for the finale, which includes a wolf, a full erection, and fireworks cascading from a torso, it's a hoot and a half.</Review>
            <Review>It's a film better experienced than intellectualized, one that unfolds like a dream. And like a dream, afterwards, you'll probably ask yourself: Did I really just see that?</Review>

            <Review>Though the comic confection's clunky moments keep it from achieving soufflé delicacy, its bright zingers and seamless fantasy sequences amp the playfulness, and the mostly unforced performances complement the production's cartoonish exuberance.</Review>
            <Review>This candy-coated confection is so irresistible that you're captivated by its sentiment even as you acknowledge its manipulations.</Review>
            <Review>If this Semitic "Strictly Ballroom" and its campy, colorful characters (including a hummus baron!) don't win you over, you may want to check your pulse.</Review>
            <Review>Fox infuses Cupcakes with Ofer's can-do optimism, where the power of song can overcome any personal or professional strife.</Review>
            <Review>The story soon gives way to characters kvetching about romance and the working world, their sentiments recycled from the director's other movies.</Review>
            <Review>Israeli helmer Eytan Fox's candy-colored musical is an endearingly goofy celebration of the right to be yourself.</Review>
            <Review>It's a stylized, gossamer-light musical comedy with gorgeous production design, a great pop score and, best of all, a group of actors who get to have fun on screen, singing and dancing together.</Review>
            <Review>Comic froth makes a few gentle jabs, but feels more like same triumph of be-true-to-thyself mantra of "Glee" with predictable romance and similar family conflict resolutions.</Review>
            <Review>Cupcakes is as colorfully splashy as anything in early Almodóvar, but even more cartoonish, and more than a little bland.</Review>
            <Review>Cupcakes finds a measured tone and cleverly juxtaposes creative expression with corporatized kitsch.</Review>
            <Review>Eytan Fox opts for a thoroughly hollow rumination on pop-culture mechanics as they pertain to young, aspiring professionals.</Review>
            <Review>...a frothy comedy that would not seem out of place on an MGM soundstage of some 70 years ago.</Review>

        <Duration>120</Duration>
        <StoryLine>On paper, the friendship between these two celebrated American icons would seem to have been impossible. But Coop and "papa" became the best of friends, right up until their deaths several weeks apart in 1961. Today, 50 years after their deaths, the intriguing and at times contentious friends which roamed from Idaho and New York to Cuba and Paris -- resonates on fascinating and diverse levels. And as the the extraordinary popularity of "Saving Private Ryan" proved. Americans are fond of looking back to another time to understand what real heroism is, to come to grips with what courage means. Ernest Hemingway and Gary Cooper dealts with this very subject. as no one had before, as has since Hemingway's fiction and Cooper's persona was not about masculinity as a one note, smash mouth force of nature; rather, it was about the self-respect that comes from comporting oneself with courage In the impossible circumstances.

            <Review>[It] has quite a lot to recommend it. But it also has a few glaring flaws that detract from it being stellar action fare.</Review>
            <Review>With its fanfare score, the movie has a nationalistic, didactic flavor and a tiresome devotion to spectacle. Even the climax is staged two ways.</Review>
            <Review>Its slow-going opening stretch and assorted mawkish subplots might just be the price a viewer has to pay for the sight of Yang and Hawk slugging it out in a biplane as it careens down a seemingly endless escape tunnel ...</Review>
            <Review>This lavish period piece contains enough thrills, spills and moments of cinematic grace that not only manage to push it through the rough spots but allow it to put most American action films of recent vintage to shame.</Review>
            <Review>This account of the People's Liberation Army's strategic ambush of a bandits' lair delivers sinewy battles and twisty espionage with a husky northern flavor.</Review>
            <Review>So when Tsui revises and redoes the climactic showdown for the sake of entertainment value, you wonder if the Hong Kong-based filmmaker writes off the whole thing as revisionist history written by victors.</Review>
            <Review>In Tsui's hands, the communist propaganda classic becomes a handy platform to showcase his craftsmanship.</Review>
            <Review>a thrill-packed adventure with soldiers on skis, murderous plot twists, precipitous zip-lining, and cut-throat mah jong</Review>
            <Review>Tsui fulfills his primary goal here of making a classic newly relevant-not just to younger Chinese viewers, but to anyone who likes action.</Review>
            <Review>In an ironic twist worthy of an opera, the very same young people who are being criticized are the ones who have bought the tickets that made this film a hit.</Review>
            <Review>Cheery and happily empty-headed, the present-day subplot adds little but sentiment to a film shot through with cliché characters, a predictable plot, and undisguised reverence.</Review>
            <Review>A big-budget spectacle overflowing with patriotic action, the movie may strike Western viewers as too impersonal and propagandistic.</Review>

            <Review>Killing Jesus is, for the most part, a missed opportunity, and despite its few good points, you're likely to conclude that, once again, the book was better.</Review>
            <Review>It's full of details that show the filmmakers did their homework, but that just makes it all the more puzzling when they change certain details for no apparent reason.</Review>
            <Review>A worthy addition to the canon of Christ films, if not quite touched by divine inspiration.</Review>
            <Review>Rendered without much embellishment and acted with firmly controlled vigor, Killing Jesus, a TV adaptation of the bestselling book by Bill O'Reilly and Martin Dugard, is a fine retelling of the story of Jesus Christ as a historical figure.</Review>
            <Review>The three-hour film is choppy, particularly in the first half, yet ultimately is an effective, compelling retelling of the story of Jesus' crucifixion.</Review>
            <Review>Once more [Jesus'] persecution leads to a kind of torture porn, as it has in previous recent films on the subject. And there isn't even the payoff for Christians of depicting any resurrection in the three hour movie.</Review>

            <Review>Writer-director-editor Robin Campillo has crafted an unruly yet pointed drama that should intrigue patient viewers.</Review>
            <Review>The movie argues that these teens' lawless, selfish mentality is a by-product of having grown up in war-stricken countries such as Chechnya, where they lived through horrors that permanently skewed their moral compasses.</Review>
            <Review>Both surprisingly resonant, and something of a thrill-ride.</Review>
            <Review>Explores interlocking themes of sexuality, immigration and power dynamics with a cleareyed sensitivity and refuses to demonize even its shadiest characters.</Review>
            <Review>By turns a frightening home-invasion drama, a tender love story and a tense hide-and-seek thriller, with far more control over these unsettling tonal slides than initially seems feasible.</Review>
            <Review>Campillo thankfully refrains from offering on-the-nose explications for behavior and decisions, instead letting audiences infer psychology and motivation from on-screen behavior.</Review>
            <Review>The film tackles solidarity and solitude, economic class, language and lingering ages -- managing to remain engaging throughout most of its two hours-plus running time.</Review>
            <Review>Dour, dark sexual drama about a rich, middle-aged French pervert (Olivier Rabourdin) who arranges for a rent boy to turn up to his plush apartment only to find his plans going awry.</Review>
            <Review>[An] ambitious and often arresting French drama.</Review>
            <Review>Campillo has fashioned an empathetic exploration of what it is to be an immigrant intertwined with an acutely original love story. This offering is clearly a highpoint of 2015 for any lover of challenging, yet immensely entertaining films.</Review>
            <Review>It's a fairly straightforward home invasion set-up, but what makes writer-director Robin Campillo's sophomore feature so intriguing is how it carefully subverts expectations.</Review>
            <Review>A torrid, slow-burning, yet highly combustive French drama, Eastern Boys is rife with psychological tension and inter-cultural unease.</Review>

            <Review>Yes, "McFarland USA" has the obligatory coda where we found out how everything played out for the coach and the key members of that 1987 team. You should stick around for that.</Review>
            <Review>The latest in a long line of condescendingly inspirational sports movies about a catalog Caucasian who learns that people of other races are also capable of being decent.</Review>
            <Review>Here's a movie that should be disposable at best, and racially condescending at worst, and yet it sticks with you. It comes by its emotions honestly and wins you over.</Review>
            <Review>You fall for the kids playing the runners because Caro lets their souls come through in the bus rides and the race sequences and the shameless scenes of cabbage picking.</Review>
            <Review>[Costner] could have sailed through this film but he gives his role an ingrained orneriness and melancholy that lifts the entire enterprise.</Review>
            <Review>Inspiration is for sale in here. And though more than a spoonful of sugar is slathered over the fact-based script, the movie delivers as promised on the thrill of the race and the lump in the throat.</Review>
            <Review>Not a 'great' film per se, but definitely a worthwhile telling of a heartwarmingly Disney, sports-themed tale.</Review>
            <Review>McFarland still warms the cockles, Costner's flawed character proves watchable and everyone, particularly the younger actors gives solid performances.</Review>
            <Review>It could move a little faster and be a little less proud of its own progressiveness. But McFarland is a sports movie that knows what it's doing for the most part and ends strong.</Review>
            <Review>What makes McFarland USA so successful, and so bracing, is the way that its protagonist becomes aware of something that is rarely broached in these sorts of narratives - his own privilege.</Review>
            <Review>Like the best sports movies, McFarland, USA makes sure the action on the field is only one part of the cinematic spectrum. And in this case, it's a spectrum worth seeing.</Review>
            <Review>There are no great surprises here but the cultural backdrop - almost everyone in the town is Mexican - adds interest and Costner is at his most relaxed and appealing.</Review>

            <Review>Business as usual for the irrepressibly cheerful, pineapple-dwelling sea-creature.</Review>
            <Review>It's big, loud, choppy, in-your-face, and absolutely, positively glorious.</Review>
            <Review>Not the most gripping narrative, but the frenetic pace and nonstop gags will please young fans.</Review>
            <Review>"The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water" remains true to the surrealism of its animated television roots. But it also tries to force a live-action element which isn't as comfortable a fit as a certain pair of symmetrical trousers.</Review>
            <Review>Even childless (and sober) I still had a pretty good time, and if you like silliness with a sprinkling of surrealism, you will too.</Review>
            <Review>There may be no good reason for such a surreal and crazy story about a sponge living in a place called "Bikini Bottom" with a starfish as a best friend to be quite this funny or endearing.</Review>
            <Review>People who love the TV series do so for the silly details, hilarious villains, the awesome cameos and the way Patrick shows that ignorance can be bliss. As long as we get that, it is fine.</Review>
            <Review>Delightful and funny in a cheesy, silly way, [the film] is a kind of cinematic sugar rush.</Review>
            <Review>The second feature film based on the long-running animated series, Paul Tibbitt's The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water is actually much better than it looks.</Review>
            <Review>SpongeBob fans -- children, sober and non-sober adults alike -- will be singing the theme song together by the movie's end.</Review>

            <Review>A desert-set men-on-a-mission movie complete with jabbering jihadis, macho hysteria and the occasional extraterrestrial waving its tentacles in the background as if to say: 'Isn't this supposed to be about me?'</Review>
            <Review>Although Edwards is onboard for the new "Monsters: Dark Continent" as an executive producer, the sequel bears no resemblance to his original, thematically or stylistically.</Review>
            <Review>Plays like a dorm-room answer to modern war films, complete with the constant profanity and masculine hysterics that pass for impact in an immature script.</Review>
            <Review>It's taxing to watch, and Green moves between scenes with Malick-inspired ellipses, frustrating momentum.</Review>
            <Review>Whatever the filmmakers' subtextual intentions may be, the film certainly gets stronger and more compelling as it goes on, thanks in part to intense emoting on the part of its cast.</Review>
            <Review>Not so much a sequel as another stultifying character drama set in a world overrun by aliens ...</Review>
            <Review>Deprived of sympathetic characters, thrills, and Edwards' skilled touch, the film makes for a disappointing follow-up to some impressive sci-fi cinema.</Review>
            <Review>Basically it's a war movie with four or five shots of giant monsters. The film would be exactly the same without them. And the characters are underwritten and unmemorable.</Review>
            <Review>Monsters are few and far between, and Dark Continent was an offensive name given to Africa by 19th century Europeans, so why exactly this film is called "Monsters: Dark Continent" is anyone's guess.</Review>
            <Review>The evidence suggests director Tom Green is more a fan of Kathryn Bigelow and Terrence Malick than of Ray Harryhausen; that's not a bad thing, unless your Bigelow-influenced monster movie is pretentious and dreary.</Review>
            <Review>The sub-Apocalypse Now existential/colonial angst lacks any form of grounding, despite committed performances from the core cast who engage in much tooth-baring, breast-beating, and shouty soul-searching.</Review>
            <Review>A glum, ear-splitting rehash of familiar elements from The Hurt Locker and Saving Private Ryan with the slippery aliens as a side dish rather than a great threat.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>Camp X-Ray raises quite a few fascinating questions about power, sexism, and war, yet fails to explore them in any real depth. More troubling still, it's a character study that does little in the way of character development.</Review>
            <Review>It's invigorated, somewhat, by strong central performances from actors on opposite sides of a locked steel door.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director Peter Sattler... grounds his story in the cold operational detail of Gitmo, showing how the soldiers there administer the legal limbo of indefinite detention and insulate themselves from the cruelty and injustice of what they're doing.</Review>
            <Review>On another movie, the high-corn finale might have worked; here, it just feels patently false.</Review>
            <Review>Has a great idea behind it - a young female soldier assigned guard duty at Guantanamo Bay forms a kinship with one of the incarcerated Muslims - but first-time writer-director Peter Sattler doesn't go anywhere interesting with that notion.</Review>
            <Review>It helps if you think of "Camp X-Ray" and the prison face-off between Stewart and Maadi as a cautionary conversation unfolding more like a theater production than a movie.</Review>
            <Review>The final 15 minutes betray the first 100, hammering all themes into our skulls. It's an unnecessarily on-the-nose finish to a mostly organic central relationship.</Review>
            <Review>The baggage Stewart brings to 'Camp X-Ray' makes its first hour more compelling than anything in the screenplay.</Review>
            <Review>This is an excellent movie. It is a powerful drama set at the Guantanamo Bay prison. It avoids political posturing and gets down the human interaction between guards and prisoners, while avoiding the usual prison clichés.</Review>
            <Review>Superbly unsettling. Pointedly highlights how incarceration dehumanizes inmate and guard alike. Kristen Stewart's steeliness is perfectly suited to its ironies.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director Sattler keeps the drama small and intimate, between two people, focusing on the minutiae of daily life inside the prison and letting us draw the moral implications.</Review>
            <Review>The final reel of Camp X-Ray is actually kinda terrible, but that's not enough to undo all the excellence that has come before. At least not for me.</Review>

            <Review>A lot of people spent a lot of time and a lot of money making a lot of movie, but there's not much there.</Review>
            <Review>The Wachowskis create a churning, swooping C.G.I. universe that's decorated to the corners of the frame without taste or imagination.</Review>
            <Review>Don't even get me started on the aliens, many of whom would have been turned away from the cantina door in Mos Eisley.</Review>

            <Review>Upon exiting, my wearied delight with Jupiter Ascending coexisted with pure bafflement. But I exited knowing that I'd seen a movie no other filmmaker could have made.</Review>
            <Review>The most disappointing aspect of Jupiter Ascending is, surprisingly, its action sequences.</Review>
            <Review>Eight-to-ten-year-olds and beyond might well find this enjoyable in its spectacular and soulless way.</Review>
            <Review>The finer plot details of this film cannot be approached without laughter: it's a pretentious, grandiose mess, packed with tiresome special effects that at least distract from the dreadful dialogue.</Review>
            <Review>'Jupiter Ascending' is a thematic cornucopia of 'Star Wars/Trek/Gate,' 'The Matrix,' 'Predator,' 'Wolf,' even 'Turbo' (the snail cartoon), and at least seven more.</Review>
            <Review>The storytelling is clumsy, the characters are befuddling, and the Wachowskis' action sequences - once so graceful and thrilling - are ugly, noisy, and worst of all, boring.</Review>
            <Review>Given the ambitions the Wachowskis have shown in the Matrix films and Cloud Atlas, this is rather retrograde as both filmmaking and storytelling, but there is a charge to their pulp sci-fi paperback cover come to life.</Review>

            <Review>If it's so easy to guess what women want, why is this movie so utterly devoid of any of it?</Review>
            <Review>That sound you hear is the high-fives in the writers' room, and that, unfortunately, is where the filmmakers' focus remains.</Review>
            <Review>[For Smith,] Focus isn't a full return to brilliance but a welcome stop, hopefully, on the way there.</Review>
            <Review>It's a shiny, diverting ride. (And right about now, that's OK.)</Review>
            <Review>Perhaps the film's greatest trick is the one that happens offscreen: Hours after the end credits roll, it will completely disappear from your mind.</Review>
            <Review>This is the kind of movie where we're not supposed to know at any time who is playing whom, but since the characterizations are glossy and paper-thin, it's difficult to get worked up about who gets fleeced.</Review>
            <Review>The best thing about Focus, as with any successful caper flick, is that you are never quite certain when the con is on and when it's off.</Review>
            <Review>It's one of those movies where everything turns out to be a con so you never have to think about which thing is a con, meaning you can sit back and enjoy an OK-enough comedy about a May-December relationship built on a foundation of gambling and thievery.</Review>
            <Review>It reminds us why he became a star in the first place, and provides a glimpse of where he might go from here.</Review>
            <Review>Regardless of its gleaming production and costume design, smooth technical style and frisky musical score, Focus is largely seductive because Smith and Robbie are the seducers.</Review>
            <Review>While Focus is probably instructive for those wanting to know how to create a diversion and steal a wallet, it lacks the tension and jeopardy required to give this film the momentum it needs to be more than just forgettable fun.</Review>

Actually, it has about as much relation to truth as a Heckle and Jeckle cartoon, but with such gorgeous creatures as Cornel Wilde and Merle Oberon in the leads, who cared? Though Wilde, as Chopin, is the nominal lead, top billing goes to Paul Muni, hamming his way through the role of Chopin's mentor Professor Joseph Elsner. Reportedly, Muni developed his characterization long before shooting started, refusing to allow the performances of the other actors to alter his interpretation in the slightest. This may explain why Muni seems to be acting in a vacuum, frequently completely out of rhythm with the film and its characters. Otherwise, Cornel Wilde does a nice job as the tempestuous Chopin, whose patriotic fervency frequently takes priority over his music. Merle Oberon plays novelist George Sand, who despite her preference for male clothing proves to be "all woman" during her torrid, decade-long affair with Chopin. The film's money scene--the one that everyone talked about, keeping the picture "alive" long after its original release--occurs towards the end, when the tubercular Chopin begins hemorrhaging as he performs his Polonaise for the first time (Jose Iturbi is heard on the soundtrack, "doubling" for Wilde's ivory-tickling). Sumptuously photographed in Technicolor by Tony Gaudio and Allen M. Davey, A Song to Remember was the usually penurious Columbia Pictures' top production of 1945. Fifteen years later, the studio hoped to make lightning strike twice with its Franz Liszt biopic Song Without End, but the magic just wasn't there.</StoryLine>

        <Title>Li'l Quinquin</Title>
        <ReleaseDate/>
        <Duration>200</Duration>
        <StoryLine>French auteur Bruno Dumont, best known for uncompromising and austere dramas, proves with the comedy Li'l Quinquin that he is capable of shifting gears without conceding his signature style. This absurdist, metaphysical murder mystery opens with the discovery of human body parts stuffed inside a cow - a literal bete humaine - on the outskirts of the English Channel in northern France. The bumbling and mumbling Captain Van der Weyden (played by Bernard Pruvost) is assigned to investigate the crime, but he has to contend with a young prankster, the mischievous Quinquin (Alane Delhaye), as he proceeds to investigate the case. Dubbed an "epic farce" by the New York Film Festival, Li'l Quinquin has been compared to Twin Peaks and True Detective. But simply speaking, Li'l Quinquin is "a wonderfully weird and unexpectedly hilarious" (Scott Foundas, Variety) masterwork from one of the most important contemporary French directors.

            <Review>Heavyweight French auteur Bruno Dumont demonstrates his gift for deadpan comedy.</Review>
            <Review>The action seems to rise organically from the locale, and Dumont's grand yet intimate fiction fuses his inner world with the historical moment.</Review>
            <Review>We may find ourselves both frustrated and riveted. Something tells me Bruno Dumont wouldn't want it any other way.</Review>
            <Review>Saying "P'tit Quinquin" is Dumont's funniest and warmest film doesn't count for much, but could I interest you in one of the sharpest autocritiques in recent memory?</Review>
            <Review>This is not funny stuff, but then Dumont isn't after the sort of laughter that makes viewers feel better. His idea of the human comedy remains as grim as it is absurd.</Review>
            <Review>"Li'l Quinquin" is a quasi-epic farce that mostly wears a poker face as it elaborates his continuing obsession with the collision of humankind's bestial and spiritual impulses.</Review>
            <Review>Li'l Quinquin exists to suggest and provoke rather than declare, and is all the better for it.</Review>
            <Review>It may sound weird for a film about brutal murders, but maestro Bruno Dumont gives us a charming and often funny story, too.</Review>
            <Review>Dumont uses the extra sprawl of his canvas and the luridness of his premise to indulge himself in the best, most playful sense.</Review>
            <Review>The baroque body count is just a red herring, with France's insularity, chauvinism and bad blood the real devil here. It's a dark lesson in history which, released in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo massacre, seems all too prescient.</Review>
            <Review>P'tit Quinquin immerses you in the bucolic life of a French village near Boulogne, where a serial killer seems to be chopping up bodies.</Review>
            <Review>The injection of oddball humour does nothing to lessen the seriousness of the subject matter or the compassion with which Dumont regards his characters' hardscrabble lives.</Review>

Their mission is to help those possessed by The Evil One, an infection of the soul that is spreading fast, especially among the most vulnerable members of society: children, mental patients, and drug addicts. There is also a mysterious cult following them, making it more difficult to help those in need. Each exorcism is tougher than the one before, and every battle with Evil reveals a piece of young Alba's forgotten past - an enigma that if unconcealed could change the world as we know it.

Doing his best to survive in the rural South of the pre-WW1 years, Biarn is unofficially adopted by crusty small-town newspaper editor Doyle Magee (Gary Merrill). Also taking an interest in Biarn's future is wealthy self-made farmer Tobias Brown (Lee Marvin), whose apparently cruel treatment of the boy masks his genuine affection and concern. Highlights include an annual trotting race and a climactic set-to between Magee and Brown. The Missouri Traveller is based on the novel by John Burress.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Without its gratuitous slo-mo, this gleefully daft medieval hack 'n' slasher would last somewhere in the region of 15 minutes.</Review>
            <Review>There is a brutal simplicity to the action that will appeal to some, but in terms of non-violent content Sword of Vengeance seems stretched even for a relatively short film.</Review>
            <Review>The ritualised action sequences work well enough. It's just a pity the film-makers did not pay as much attention to the plotting as to the design of the movie.</Review>
            <Review>It's the kind of film that confuses slow-motion with significance: a shot of some rain dripping from the end of someone's nose takes minutes but tells us nothing except that the umbrella has not yet been invented.</Review>

            <Review>If you're a budding film student or a newly-minted cineaste looking for a quick and easy brush-up on the all-time great American director, Magician will serve perfectly well.</Review>
            <Review>Workman clearly reveres Welles, but he's never reverent.</Review>
            <Review>A dutiful but slightly dull celebration of the multitalented impresario ...</Review>
            <Review>If you have more time and want to get into Welles on your own, an afternoon watching YouTube videos followed by a few evenings of watching his best movies might be even better.</Review>
            <Review>It's a fine introduction, if a bit slight for fans craving new insights.</Review>
            <Review>Whatever its shortcomings, "Magician" accomplishes quite a bit as a corrective, and it also gives one an hour and a half in the company of Orson Welles.</Review>
            <Review>Magician certainly makes you want to watch all of Welles's films again, including the ones that we can't, which means it probably accomplishes its goals.</Review>
            <Review>I'm sad to report that at a mere 1 hour and 34 minutes Magician is rushed and sometimes choppy, leaping through Welles's bountiful life.</Review>
            <Review>What Workman has assembled is the kind of film Welles would have been happy to part of. It's a unique, warm and fair portrait of a man who was both genius and joke and well aware of it.</Review>
            <Review>I'm a pretty big Welles geek, so I enjoyed the experience anyway... but I can't imagine this will enlighten anyone who just wanders in off the street.</Review>
            <Review>As a primer for newcomers to the Orson Welles universe, the superficial Magician: The Astonishing Life and Work of Orson Welles does its job well.</Review>
            <Review>As fascinated as it is by Welles' ascent, his unfair decline and lifelong battles to have his visions realized, it never really offers any insight on his actual work.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2015</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>123</Duration>
        <StoryLine>A Spike Lee Joint, DA SWEET BLOOD OF JESUS is a new kind of love story, one that centers on an addiction to blood that once doomed a long forgotten ancient African tribe. When Dr. Hess Green (Stephen Tyrone Williams) is introduced to a mysteriously cursed artifact by an art curator, Lafayette Hightower (Elvis Nolasco), he is uncontrollably drawn into a newfound thirst for blood that overwhelms his soul. He however is not a vampire. Lafayette quickly succumbs to the ravenous nature of the infliction but leaves Hess a transformed man. Soon Lafayette's wife, Ganja Hightower (Zaraah Abrahams), comes looking for her husband and becomes involved in a dangerous romance with Hess that questions the very nature of love, addiction, sex, and status in our seemingly sophisticated society. A reinterpretation of Bill Gunn's horror cult film "Ganja &amp; Hess", which played as a Critics' Choice at the 1973 Cannes Film Festival, Spike Lee's stylized thriller features an Original Score by Bruce Hornsby.</StoryLine>

            <Review>"Da Sweet Blood of Jesus" is a bold but wildly uneven, bloody mess of a film, sunk in large part by the subpar performances by nearly every major character in nearly every major role.</Review>
            <Review>Never once does the film feel sharp on black identity (as did Bill Gunn's original), and the terror is theoretical only.</Review>
            <Review>The film is a hypnotically nightmarish mood piece more than anything else; it makes sense and yet doesn't make sense, in the way that dreams do and don't make sense.</Review>
            <Review>Unrepentant, uneven and unique, "Da Sweet Blood of Jesus" proves that Lee can still make a film worthy of the arguments it will most certainly start.</Review>
            <Review>Da Sweet Blood of Jesus is a mess, but it's the kind of mess only one of our greatest filmmakers could make.</Review>
            <Review>While this return to indie roots frees up Lee's often gifted image making, his usual pace issues and penchant for jagged flourish over sustained feeling keep it from achieving a rich, strange, sexy and sad whole.</Review>
            <Review>It's a startlingly incompetent film, suggesting that we've reached a point where Lee's instincts as a filmmaker - so unimpeachable a quarter century ago - have abandoned him entirely.</Review>
            <Review>Praise God. Da Sweet Blood of Jesus is Spike Lee's freest-feeling endeavor in a spell.</Review>
            <Review>Spike Lee's Da Sweet Blood of Jesus is a loving adaptation of Bill Gunn's 1973 Ganja &amp; Hess.</Review>
            <Review>Lee certainly doesn't schlock things up. But he doesn't add much excitement, either.</Review>
            <Review>Our American addiction...bloodsucking from humanity in order to maintain the lifestyle to which we are accustomed. By the time Hess wearily muses, "I'm tired of this existence," it's more or less clear he means a spiritually empty capitalist existence...</Review>
            <Review>An engaging work, one that finds Spike Lee adapting his considerable skills to a new genre. It's not his best movie, but it's definitely one of his most unlikely, and therefore most fascinating.</Review>

            <Review>Erotic thrillers are a time-tested genre, but this effort, scripted by Wesley Strick, is neither erotic nor thrilling.</Review>
            <Review>This new iteration proves such a dour hodgepodge of bad behavior, bald-faced misogyny and ping-ponging alliances, it's more alienating than alluring.</Review>
            <Review>The Loft is a film that can't decide what it wants. It's a male fantasy, and a cautionary tale. It's sleazy in concept, and timid in execution. It punishes its protagonists for their transgressions, then lets them off the hook.</Review>
            <Review>There's no redeeming this softcore nonsense, which plays like a script that Storage Wars stumbled across in Joe Eszterhas's old locker.</Review>
            <Review>The twisty plot translates to any culture where swinging-d--- businessmen cheat on their wives -- which is to say, any culture.</Review>
            <Review>The Loft's boorish leads aren't sensible enough to be worth caring about, making the film's character-driven conclusion feel like a self-defeating cop-out.</Review>
            <Review>The plotting gets too clever by half towards the end, but... this remains a slick and stylish whodunit.</Review>
            <Review>Plausibility isn't in the cards for this odious excuse for a thriller. This is all about sexy danger, for sociopathic, misogynistic values of 'sexy danger.'</Review>
            <Review>Doubtless, the film's biggest problem is that the five male leads are distinctly unlikable.</Review>
            <Review>The problem with 9-Month Stretch is that is a movie is composed of good moments, but the uneven pace doesn't help the audience to engage with the plot. [full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>It's a common and ordinary thriller with a intelligent premise, but poor execution, wasted cast and late plot twists that are almost ridiculous. [full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>The characters in 'The Loft' are so despicable you won't care about what happens to any of them.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>Quite apart from the equally apparent lack of the Coens's extraordinary visual acuity, Cut Bank comes up short because it simply presumes that guilt and evil already live in town, just waiting for us to arrive and see the show.</Review>
            <Review>Deficient in charisma, Hemsworth lacks both the grit and grin that his complicated role demands.</Review>
            <Review>In this sort of film, plenty of characters hope to get out of their small-time town, while viewers hope to get out of the theater.</Review>
            <Review>Like many of its brethren, the movie seems to love itself while hating its characters.</Review>
            <Review>While there's some undeniably inherent joy in just seeing some of these great actors play off each other, the sum here is a shockingly dull affair, almost made more disappointing by the talent it wastes.</Review>
            <Review>Shakman is clearly going for a dark and bloody Fargo-style crime thriller, but the biggest crime in the film is just how derivative it all feels.</Review>
            <Review>Cut Bank is ersatz in almost every way, a parade of dumb people doing foolish things while other, dumber people plod along behind them slowly putting things together.</Review>
            <Review>This well-cast grabber holds few surprises, but plenty of dark humor that suggests vastly superior films like "Fargo" or "Blood Simple."</Review>
            <Review>Once blood starts spurting and the old pros take control of the show, Patino's clever plotting wins viewers over.</Review>
            <Review>Admirers of small-town gamesmanship when it comes to murder will likely be the most entertained, but even the most patient with Matt Shakman's movie might find their attention wandering away while the film struggles to sustain suspense.</Review>
            <Review>This is one script that no doubt read a lot better than it was ever going to look or sound.</Review>
            <Review>Less 'Fargo Lite' than 'Fargo Flat'...a thoroughly pedestrian stroll through Coen brothers territory.</Review>

            <Review>It's filled with delicious moments, particularly for dance fans ...</Review>
            <Review>The fly [on the wall] is very good at getting access...but rather less good at giving context.</Review>
            <Review>There are few titles and no interviews or narration. Entire scenes go by without anyone speaking. Instead, Ballet 422 is a very intimate look at the process.</Review>
            <Review>For fans of dance, "Ballet 422" will produce plenty of pleasures. But as with great ballet, great movies always benefit from a little drama.</Review>
            <Review>What makes Jody Lee Lipes documentary so interesting - even transfixing at times - is the fact that nothing is editorialized or explained. There are no interviews or voice-overs.</Review>
            <Review>With its brisk pace and unique style, Ballet 422 is a cinematic gem that encapsulates the passion of two inspired artists, the one in front of the camera and the one behind it.</Review>
            <Review>I have zero interest in ballet, but this film held my interest. It isn't so much about ballet itself, as much as it is about all the people involved in creating and presenting a ballet, and how they all work together so effectively.</Review>
            <Review>In this beautifully muted documentary by cinematographer-director Jody Lee Lipes, a New York City Ballet company dancer gets and takes a chance to create his own show.</Review>
            <Review>Since dance is so difficult to describe, there are some great expressions. My favourite is when Justin tells a performer a sequence is "not crispy enough." Thing is, you get what he means.</Review>

            <Review>Let Us Prey feels at once classic and modern; horror the way it was always supposed to have been made. You will not be disappointed.</Review>
            <Review>Half an homage to horror stories you already know, and half a collection of themes, ideas, moments, and shocks you might not see coming.</Review>
            <Review>Working with wunderkind cinematographer Piers McGrail, O'Malley keeps the carnage coming and images memorable.</Review>
            <Review>...a stagy and wholly uninvolving mess that's something of a chore to sit through.</Review>
            <Review>...if the storytelling is a bit loose, it's more than made up for by the splendid cinematography of Piers McGrail and O'Malley's knowing exploitation of horror tropes.</Review>
            <Review>A paranoid, condensed supernatural thriller, Let Us Prey exhibits brooding visual flair with a story that begins as an engaging mystery, but sadly loses steam at about the midway point.</Review>
            <Review>Debut director Brian O'Malley has crafted an intriguing horror flick that, aside from a few cheap scares, attempts to avoid tired clichés.</Review>

            <Review>"Seventh Son" moves at a fairly quick pace and has a sense of humor about itself. That doesn't mean it's thrilling, or funny. Just that it's a quickly forgotten pile of junk.</Review>
            <Review>It's a loud, joyless mess.</Review>
            <Review>Impressive set design and visuals, excessive CGI, and a loud score from Marco Beltrami can't fully compensate for bland character development and a predictable narrative that rushes along on a linear trajectory.</Review>
            <Review>A strange movie that manages to be both ridiculous and bland, its chief point of interest is the spectacle of a great actor caught in career decline.</Review>
            <Review>Sometimes you get halfway through a movie and you can't believe that what you're seeing made its way from Los Angeles or someone's Los Angeles computer to where you're sitting.</Review>
            <Review>No masterpiece, but a welcome February surprise with a lively cast and rugged action.</Review>
            <Review>You've simply never seen such flat-out bad acting from Jeff Bridges. It almost feels like a dare: 'Let me just see how bad I can be, without anyone calling me on it.'</Review>
            <Review>Even best actress Oscar winners can have a bad day at the office, and this is one of those for Julianne Moore.</Review>
            <Review>At first you won't quite believe you can make it through such hokey dialogue and daft clichés, but it's not long before it turns into something rather enjoyable. Fun - but leave your brain at home.</Review>
            <Review>The key to enjoying Seventh Son is to keep modest expectations. And, in this case, "modest expectations" probably means you're better off saving your first-run dollars and waiting for cheaper options.</Review>
            <Review>A fantasy adventure film needs more than "cool creatures," a rousing score, and two certifiably over-the-top performances to make a lasting impression.</Review>
            <Review>The film is basically a rich man's Uwe Boll version of Dungeons and Dragons -- a lot of tacky visuals, world-building mumbo-jumbo and gooey CGI creatures encased in a narrative vacuum.</Review>

            <Review>A mixed-bag variation on found-footage horror, with creepily atmospheric moments as well as too much mood-killing blabber.</Review>
            <Review>"Nightlight" is a perfect example of a film with interesting ideas that are totally smothered by poor execution.</Review>
            <Review>"When does this end?" a terrified Robin asks. It's a valid question.</Review>
            <Review>While the premise is as absurd as it sounds, it does buck the trend of recent found-footage films that defy their internal logic with parts not produced by cameras available within the story.</Review>

            <Review>"Dial a Prayer" doesn't work.</Review>
            <Review>Somber meditation on belief, redemption has heavy themes.</Review>
            <Review>A rather touching portrait of a young woman's human growth, laced with a salutary number of small yet piquant observations along the way.</Review>
            <Review>I recommend Dial A Prayer for its actors - Snow is well-cast, Macy is of course golden in every single thing he does, and the supporting cast is likeable - and a story that's got a good message yet is not overly preachy in delivering it.</Review>
            <Review>Dial a Prayer is earnest and sincere, and it has a stellar performance from its lead actress, yet lacks the punch to make the kind of inspiring impact it's clearly aiming for.</Review>
            <Review>Just edgy enough to be interesting, maybe too edgy to qualify as a faith-based drama.</Review>
            <Review>Achieves a spiritual significance that is universally palatable as its protagonist finds not religion but harmony with herself.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>You get the feeling there's much more to this relationship than we've been shown, but for fans of Refn's work, the documentary makes for a provocative portrait of an artist racked by angst.</Review>
            <Review>It feels supplemental more than essential.</Review>
            <Review>With a running time of one hour, "My Life" probably should have just been a special feature on the "Only God Forgives" DVD.</Review>
            <Review>Suggests the sacrifices required of those who live in an artist's orbit, but it fails to offer what groupies surely want, which is insight into Refn's creative process.</Review>
            <Review>Corfixen documents her husband's creative process as well as his mental state, which comes in two basic modes: confidently inspired and nervously despondent.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director Liv Corfixen works harder to coddle Drive director Refn, her husband and subject, than she does to get inside his head.</Review>
            <Review>Plainly, life is difficult for Refn at times, and [the film] shows both the curious nature of being in that position and why he continues to garner a reputation as a director to seek out.</Review>
            <Review>Director Liv Corfixen stays conspicuously absent throughout, hiding behind the lens as Refn oscillates wildly between moods.</Review>
            <Review>Strictly for Refn fans, especially those like me trying to figure out where he went astray.</Review>
            <Review>What's here elevates what could be a relatively uninteresting on-set diary to a concise look at different artists balancing different goals.</Review>
            <Review>it is shot by Refn's wife, Liv Corfixen, as a sort of home (away from home) movie, focused far less on Refn's shoot than on her own at times difficult domestic life with a husband who is also a full-time filmmaker and a demanding neurotic depressive.</Review>
            <Review>It doesn't have anything interesting to say, but it shows some neat stuff about movie making. My Life Directed by Nicolas Winding Refn's only real problem is its subject.</Review>

        <Title>�tat de Si�ge (State of Siege)</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 1972</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>120</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Like most of Costa-Gavras' political thrillers, the French State of Siege is based on a true story. The incident dramatized herein is the kidnapping of a U.S. official somewhere in Latin America. The director's sympathies clearly lie with the kidnappers, especially since the official (played by Yves Montand), ostensibly an expert in traffic control, has been assigned as special advisor to the government's secret police, training these worthies in the art of the torturing of political prisoners. Uruguay was the country where this story actually took place; though no names are given, there's little doubting the identity of Costa-Gavras' fictional locale. Despite its up-to-date radicalism, State of Siege adheres to time-honored Hollywood formula, with ugly, vulgar bad guys vs. handsome, articulate good guys.</StoryLine>

            <Review>What we get-a bitty and begrimed romance-has a lyrical sway of its own, and, even if some of the cast seem lost in the lines, Hawke returns to save the day, and the movie.</Review>
            <Review>A conceptually weak and dramatically muddled mess that has acquired a game and good cast and then given them precious little to do.</Review>
            <Review>If too many filmmakers try to amp up the excitement in Shakespeare with movie magic, Almereyda goes to the opposite extreme in Cymbeline.</Review>
            <Review>A mash-up of social media shortcomings and Shakespearean tragedy that becomes as much a tale of cinematic ambition gone awry as anything the Bard intended.</Review>
            <Review>The film has moments of real wit and stylish brutality, but its nods to modernity (motorcycles, iPads, Google) just feel like self-conscious stunts.</Review>
            <Review>"Cymbeline" has been branded a tragedy, a tragicomedy and a romance, and Mr. Almereyda embraces all three categories. The movie is by turns grim, grimly amusing and romantic, sometimes at once.</Review>
            <Review>Of course, Ed Harris as a leather-jacket-wearing biker monarch blasting away with an assault rifle gives Almereyda a solid base to work from.</Review>
            <Review>Almereyda is back at it fourteen years later with Cymbeline, a dramatically clunkier Shakespeare play, both in and of itself and for the challenges it presents to a modern adaptation.</Review>
            <Review>Cymbeline's familiar Elizabethan tropes do not translate well to a modern context, nor do the constant references to 'Caesar' or 'Romans.'</Review>
            <Review>Michael Almereyda's modernized adaptation of Cymbeline comes to the screen with a number of flaws, including an overstuffed plot and a questionable structure.</Review>
            <Review>... strips down the Bard's narrative and ramps up the sex and violence, which is fine, but as with other such projects, the anachronistic dialogue is awkward and the storytelling is muddled and convoluted.</Review>
            <Review>Almereyda never gives us a reason why this particular Shakespeare story is relevant for today, and thus worthy of being retold. Perhaps he watched too much Sons of Anarchy?</Review>

            <Review>While it might have made for a mildly diverting stage thriller -- the hugely successful Deathtrap, for instance, was built on similarly absurd contrivances -- the endlessly talky 3 Holes and a Smoking Gun founders onscreen.</Review>

            <Review>Director Hilarion Banks dutifully captures all of it in a series of nicely shot extended takes, which would have been fine if the cast had been able to interact in some sort of uniform tone.</Review>

        <Duration>93</Duration>
        <StoryLine>A troubled young man and his straight-laced niece embark on a thrilling odyssey through New York City in this heartrending drama based on an Oscar-winning short. As his life hits rock bottom, 20-something Richie (Shawn Christensen) decides to end it all-only to have his half-hearted suicide attempt interrupted by an urgent request from his sister (Emmy Rossum) to babysit her precocious daughter (Fatima Ptacek). So begins a madcap tour of Manhattan after dark, as uncle and niece find unexpected bonds in the unlikeliest of places. Ron Perlman co-stars in this hugely moving adaptation of up-and-coming director/star Christensen's own 2013 Academy Award-winning short Curfew. (C) IFC Films</StoryLine>

            <Review>"Before I Disappear" would be a better movie if would-be triple-threat talent Shawn Christensen got out of his own way.</Review>
            <Review>Before I Disappear is ultimately hampered not by a messy plot but by bland characters who, for the most part, don't so much talk to each other as they monologue at each other.</Review>
            <Review>It has the unfortunate taste of something lean that's been plumped up with empty calories.</Review>
            <Review>"Before I Disappear" wears its big, aching heart on its sleeve with a sincerity so unwavering that it's borderline goofy. And in a film about a burnout bonding with a cute kid, that lack of self-awareness proves critical.</Review>
            <Review>Throughout the movie, you have the feeling of being dragged along on an impromptu journey by a filmmaker who is traveling without the benefit of a GPS device.</Review>
            <Review>It's hard to take hectoring parent Emmy Rossum seriously, and there's too much troubling development tucked into a plot that already feels overextended. A surfeit of last-act explanations doesn't help either.</Review>
            <Review>The result of this is Before I Disappear, a darkly comic film about love and family with rich characters and an original voice.</Review>
            <Review>Christensen, who not only stars but writes, produces, and directs, does about a dozen things simultaneously that most movies can't get right individually.</Review>
            <Review>Christensen can't settle on a satisfactory tone-mawkish one moment, menacing the next... His movie is so vehement about Richie's redemption that even its bumpy detours are dully predictable.</Review>
            <Review>The self-indulgent screenplay doesn't commit to its quirky deadpan humor and never generates enough narrative momentum to warrant feature expansion.</Review>
            <Review>"Before I Disappear" suffers from a bland, disinterested tone. In the end, few will care when all of these people disappear.</Review>
            <Review>"Before I Disappear" isn't a bad freshman effort, but it doesn't offer anything to set it apart from dozens of other indie dramedies.</Review>

            <Review>Leviathan offers a wry version of the tragedy that occurs when normal people challenge entrenched hierarchies.</Review>
            <Review>Early and strong contender for this year's best miserable time at the movies.</Review>
            <Review>Heavy stuff but highly rewarding, and an illuminating look into a country still steeped in its brutal past.</Review>
            <Review>Yes, this could happen anywhere, but you get the feeling it happens often in Russia. The only real hope here is that a movie this hard on the motherland could be made there.</Review>
            <Review>"Leviathan" plays like downer Tolstoy, masterfully specific to these people and unforgivingly allegorical toward the country at large.</Review>
            <Review>A story of political and spiritual corruption, of men and women accustomed to power, and of others fighting against it.</Review>
            <Review>This is a tale of vodka-fueled dysfunction, of the meaninglessness of a life in which fairness and freedom are little more than easily ignored words.</Review>
            <Review>Zvyagintsev has craftedLeviathan with the most sublimated of directing, letting each scene play out with a quiet, methodic use of pace and performance.</Review>
            <Review>Leviathan has the form of a parable, the soul of a Russian tragedy, and the moral outrage of a j'accuse.</Review>
            <Review>Certain to be one of the great films of the cinephile's year.</Review>
            <Review>You might assume it is one of those ponderous, overlong and overly symbolic films that are annoyingly commonplace on the film festival circuit. But you would be dead wrong.</Review>
            <Review>Just as the chill of winter makes its acquaintance with us, Zvyagintsev hits us with the feel-bad hit of the year, 140-minutes of wide-angled dramatic rumination on the functional rot at the core of Russian society.</Review>

            <Review>The movie captures that heady adolescent sense of time stopping and the moment mattering while standing far enough back to let us acknowledge all the pitfalls Marieme is moving too fast to see.</Review>
            <Review>From the opening montage of Marieme and other girls playing American football in full uniform, "Girlhood" resonates as something special.</Review>
            <Review>"Girlhood" is about as grim as movies get, but it's showing something real, and Sciamma has a feel for this period of life, the camaraderie, the jokes, the kinds of conflicts, the panic and the hope.</Review>
            <Review>Director Sciamma uses an uncommonly light touch in depicting Marieme's gradual transformation from an unformed blank slate into a self-assured girl who doesn't always make the right decisions in the process of figuring herself out.</Review>
            <Review>Sciamma (Water Lilies, Tomboy) gets unaffected performances from her non-professional cast.</Review>
            <Review>"Girlhood" is a mesmerizing exercise in the enlightenment that can happen when a filmmaker shifts the male cinematic gaze ever so slightly and uncovers what looks like a whole new world.</Review>
            <Review>A robust, forceful depiction this is of a type of personal story that gets virtually no screen time.</Review>
            <Review>Symptomatic of the national picture, Girlhood is an unflinching portrait into the seething cauldron of interminable chaos created by the fractured social structures in contemporary Paris.</Review>
            <Review>Compassionate, profound and pertinent...</Review>
            <Review>Girlhood captures how wonderful it is to even briefly belong.</Review>
            <Review>[Marieme] has a long road into the seemingly inescapable marginalization of poor young black women ahead of her. But Girlhood offers some hope that the fleeting moments remain.</Review>
            <Review>More in common with the French New Wave than Italian neorealism, this is a film that both celebrates and sheds tears over gansta life. It is the French version of "New Jack City" in some ways.</Review>

            <Review>It's a dull, lazy, scattershot would-be comedy about a group of mostly unlikable characters who have all the depth of the Three Stooges in the Curly Joe era.</Review>
            <Review>Provided you find any of this funny, the anarchic spirit can be exhilarating, but don't waste too much energy on it.</Review>
            <Review>Hot Tub Time Machine 2 is so bad it might make you question your allegiance to the original Hot Tub Time Machine.</Review>
            <Review>Sans the original's redemptive nostalgia or any newfound cleverness, it's just a manic, flop-sweat-drenched mess.</Review>
            <Review>Corddry, Robinson, Duke, and Scott have their partisans in the audience, but they're not actors who can carry a movie, even when it's split four ways -- not when their default settings tend to be some variation on "big baby" and "obnoxious jerk.</Review>
            <Review>Pretty much a total waste of time and energy.</Review>

            <Review>when the most notable thing about your movie is its continued reliance on recycled ideas and puerile stupidity, it doesn't make it destined for much else beyond a casual "Ha."</Review>

            <Review>American Sniper has a perspective that's recognizable from the classic Westerns Eastwood has long been associated with, both as an actor and a director. It's an existential critique of violent machismo that doubles as a celebration of violence.</Review>
            <Review>Eastwood makes the moral stakes almost nonexistent.</Review>
            <Review>It speaks emotionally to audiences who sense that we lost something in Iraq, yet still want to honor the heroism of those who risked their lives for the cause, whether or not it was ultimately a great one.</Review>
            <Review>Clint Eastwood's American Sniper is an often lazy and somewhat hazy propaganda film about American heroism and hell in the Iraq War.</Review>
            <Review>Although Cooper succeeds in resembling and sounding like the real Kyle, this isn't some cheap impersonation trick. Cooper gives maybe the best performance of his career.</Review>
            <Review>Director Clint Eastwood deftly shows the mental and physical toll of heroism in a way that will leave you gutted.</Review>
            <Review>Not only watchable, but quite good - the kind of lean, mean mediation on masculinity and duty that this particular filmmaker has always done so well.</Review>
            <Review>Kyle killed two men, as a civilian, with his massive Colt .44 Magnum. That's a 'Dirty Harry' gun. Who directed 'American Sniper'? Dirty Harry did. That's terribly ironic.</Review>
            <Review>Cooper excels in the central role while Eastwood succeeds in the difficult task of delivering a war movie that focuses more on the personal sacrifice made by soldiers than it does on politics. It's all the better for it.</Review>
            <Review>Well made and briskly edited, American Sniper is a decent and very watchable action film. But it appears to have absolutely nothing to say about the politics behind all the soldiering.</Review>
            <Review>Cooper is very good in the film, bulking up to built fat status, mostly nailing Kyle's southern lilt, and selling the inner turmoil of a family left behind.</Review>
            <Review>You hardly recognize Cooper, with a muscular physique, beard and kind of a swagger.</Review>

        <StoryLine>LOVESICK is the comic tale of Charlie Darby (Matt LeBlanc), a man who has everything going for him: a great job as an elementary school principal, supportive friends and a wonderful life. The one thing that Charlie doesn't have is love because every time he starts to fall for a girl, his brain chemistry changes and he goes clinically insane. When he meets Molly Kingston (Ali Larter), a former dancer who just might be his perfect match, Charlie is confronted with the consequences of his condition. With the help of his friend Jason (Adam Rodriguez) and the often misguided advice from his wacky neighbor Lester (Chevy Chase), Charlie must find a way to overcome his psychosis to claim his chance at true love.

        <Reviews>
            <Review>Although "Lovesick" plays more like an extended sitcom episode than a full-fledged feature film, the script by Dean Young contains enough genuine laughs and amusing moments to keep this slight romantic farce afloat.</Review>
            <Review>With the reek of straight-to-video wafting from every frame, "Lovesick" astonishes most by its appearance in an actual theater.</Review>
            <Review>Matt LeBlanc is so great on Showtime's "Episodes" that it's both baffling and depressing to imagine that this soulless rom-com was the best big-screen project available to him.</Review>
            <Review>LeBlanc and Larter carry the day with a spectrum of charm missing from too many entries in this shaky, persistent genre.</Review>
            <Review>If you like your rom-coms blandly predictable, there is a market for this.</Review>
            <Review>Quirky romcom parody has some mature content.</Review>
            <Review>"Lovesick" lives up to its title, as it's hard to feel anything but nausea after sitting through it.</Review>
            <Review>The lead character here, quite deeply disturbed, is actually presented as a worthy romantic hero.</Review>
            <Review>A light-hearted romantic comedy about jealousy.</Review>
            <Review>It's not love that is sick-it's the fact that Matheny ended a four-year wait to return to filmmaking with such a disposable, banal project.</Review>
            <Review>Lovesick is actually kind of a pleasantly weightless romantic comedy with moments of hilarity here and there from massive misunderstandings.</Review>
            <Review>Audiences should know well enough to stay away from this perversely bland, achingly dull romantic comedy.</Review>

While most bees believe that other insects should be feared, Maya can't help but make friends with Flip the charismatic and eccentric grasshopper, Kurt the dung beetle and even Sting, a young hornet.

            <Review>"Maya the Bee" embodies the kind of self-consciously uplifting treacle some adults insist kids want. They package "Maya" like honey, but it tastes like medicine.</Review>
            <Review>The film's messages about friendship, acceptance and being yourself are clear enough for the young, and grown-ups can read the story as a warning about conformity and about going to war on false pretenses.</Review>

            <Review>The ultimate triumph in what Amalric has done is to show us all the different forces that can be at work in an affair.</Review>
            <Review>A dazzling deconstruction of the mystery genre that turns its conventions on their heads.</Review>
            <Review>If anything, it's a backhanded testimony to the plodding effectiveness of detail-minded detective work and the slow grinding of the bureaucratic justice machine.</Review>
            <Review>'The Blue Room" is a tight little look at love gone wrong, something of a stripped-down French "Gone Girl" without the surprises.</Review>
            <Review>It's an accomplished film, if a bit cool and tidy; you wish there were a little more to it.</Review>
            <Review>The pleasure of a whodunit generally derives from trying to figure out who done it, but in the case of this arty, terminally obscure French mystery, most of the story has already transpired before one can even piece together what was done.</Review>
            <Review>Mathieu Amalric and partner Stéphanie Cléau make a potent team both behind and in front of the camera in this steamy French noir that manages to get its dark thrills wrapped up in a trim and tidy 76 minutes.</Review>
            <Review>An unfolding police investigation leaves us guessing until the final moment just what exactly happened when an illicit love affair turned bad.</Review>
            <Review>An artfully composed mix of crime mystery, erotic melodrama, police procedural and courtroom drama, [this] compact 75-minute movie is upfront about nudity but very teasing when it comes to revealing its plot.</Review>
            <Review>On the evidence here, former Bond villain Amalric is every bit as accomplished a director as he is an actor.</Review>
            <Review>[Almaric] aims for what he calls the "permanent pleasure of doubt" and he succeeds - but sometimes the doubt is alienating and we long for some of the passion we saw in that blue room at the start.</Review>
            <Review>Amalric is a fine director in his own right and his performances on either side of the camera ensure this is mesmerising and unsettling.</Review>

            <Review>"The Living" presents itself as a searing genre piece about domestic violence, but it proves to be only a shell of its potential.</Review>
            <Review>An effective modern day noir.</Review>
            <Review>The emotional dynamics in domestic violence, for the abuser and the abused, are often too disturbing and complex to be treated as superficially as "The Living" does.</Review>

            <Review>It's an ungainly documentary featuring animated sequences, but it also gives a sense of a country ruined by tribal wars and menaced by the temptation of easy cash.</Review>
            <Review>Disjointed and unfocused, "Last Hijack" adds precious little to this body of work.</Review>
            <Review>Despite providing a sober and hauntingly frustrated glimpse into a world that most Western eyes will never get to see for themselves, this portrait of life as a Somali pirate is limited by what the camera can't see.</Review>
            <Review>The filmmakers have gotten extraordinary access to Mohamed and ravaged Somalia.</Review>
            <Review>Relentlessly brooding and engaging, it is certainly worth seeing.</Review>
            <Review>Although a little messy in places, it's a fascinating look at world we would have little access to.</Review>
            <Review>Last Hijack is good on context and nicely presented. Sadly, it fails to convert Nura's biography into a coherent narrative and contains nothing that might be mistaken for a denouement.</Review>
            <Review>Mixing animation and documentary in evocative ways, Last Hijack is an illuminating look at the thrill and the toll of Somali piracy.</Review>
            <Review>Easily one of the best documentaries of 2014, "Last Hijack" explores the motivations, circumstances, fears and dreams of a real-life pirate in an admirably objective fashion, while also visualizing his thoughts via gorgeous, lucid-dream-like animation.</Review>
            <Review>LAST HIJACK isn't an especially entertaining film, but it's a troubling one and worth seeing even if only for the insight into this phenomenon that it provides.</Review>
            <Review>With intriguing use of animation, this doc reminds us that pirates may be ordinary citizens struggling to make a living.</Review>
            <Review>The dark, surreal animation unearths the personal side of the story: its nightmarish aspect and traumas.</Review>

        <StoryLine>They say a picture is worth a thousand words. Former paparazzi Thomas Grady's most recent picture is certainly worth a lot more. Thomas (Zach McGowan) has inadvertently captured a scandalous, revealing shot of one of the world's most prominent and beloved figures-The First Lady (Joyce DeWitt). What ensues is a terrific conflict of morals, love and money. Selling the picture could resolve all of Thomas' professional and financial troubles, but it will also force him to confront the love of his life (Angela Gots) and his family (Robert Loggia, David Chokachi) as this photo puts the true nature of their relationships to a test. The choices aren't clear as the blurry line between the public's right to know and an individual's right to privacy is crossed. Then there's the President (Michael Pare) and The First Lady, who want the embarrassing picture back; how far do you think they will go to protect their privacy? Not to mention this could cost The President the upcoming election. Their henchman (Martin Kove) steps into the fray. Of course they are not the only ones who would like to get their hands on this photo. What would you do if it was your Privacy for Sale? How far would you go? Then there is the big surprise ending, which is reminiscent of 'The Sixth Sense' leaving viewers asking themselves 'How did I miss that?'. (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>James (Kodi-Smit-McPhee) has shut himself off from his surroundings, falling into a world of imagination and darkness. Visits with his psychiatrist (Danny Devito) have proven unhelpful - though he takes a liking to fellow patient, Val (Isabelle Fuhrman). As James begins to rebel against his single mother (Virginia Madsen), he ventures into the night where he meets a mysterious kid (Evan Ross) who welcomes him into an eccentric city. Relationships are put to the test as James navigates unfamiliar territory, wrestling with the reality of his own personal wilderness. (C) Screen Media</StoryLine>

            <Review>Ultimately amounts to a visually ambitious tone poem about the none-too-surprising caprices of male adolescence.</Review>
            <Review>Affected and slow, and more concerned with mood than plot, this moony first feature from Michael Johnson uses its Portland, Ore., setting as a canvas for mapping a course from isolation to companionship.</Review>
            <Review>"All the Wilderness" seems tailor-made to play to the actor's strengths - Johnson's script is as lean as Smit-McPhee, both proving adept at doing more with less.</Review>
            <Review>A familiar but insightful debut.</Review>
            <Review>First-time writer/director Michael Johnson falls back on coming-of-age clichés. But overall, his sensitive, moody camerawork and the cast's strong performances go a long way toward making the familiar feel fresh.</Review>
            <Review>Johnson unquestionably has his heart in the right place, but he's made a commonplace film built around one of those too-fragile-for-this-world teens who can be traced directly back to Timothy Hutton in Ordinary People.</Review>
            <Review>More like a visual poem than a fully formed exploration of grief, guilt, teen angst or feeling like an outsider</Review>
            <Review>The material is undeniably shopworn, but Johnson's spin on it is low-key and vivid.</Review>
            <Review>As a filmmaker, Johnson has an experimental way with a camera that shows promise for the future.</Review>
            <Review>... too slight and formulaic to have much of an impact.</Review>
            <Review>[Instead of being] "yet another" coming-of-age/identity-quest film [...] All the Wilderness is interlaced with literate and interesting characters.</Review>
            <Review>Coming of age yarns sink or swim based on their protagonist. The minds behind All the Wilderness chose well with Kodi Smit-McPhee.</Review>

        <Title>The Immortalists</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>88</Duration>
        <StoryLine>'Cure ageing... or die trying.' So goes the rallying call of Bill Andrews, the American scientist searching for a solution to the great inevitable. A health-conscious runner, his approach contrasts sharply with the methods of his British counterpart Aubrey de Grey, a magnificently bearded, beer-swilling theoretical biologist. The science is fascinating, with complex theories spun out through onscreen animation. And the moral and social implications are certainly meaty. But it is the characters themselves who are the most compelling element of this film. As we spend time with these radical biologists the personal reasons for their quests emerge, with particularly touching scenes detailing their parental relationships. And, like many a high-functioning brainiac, they possess a cadre of peccadilloes, none more so than de Grey, whose views on polyamory and al fresco lovemaking seamlessly flow into a philosophy that both men share - the absolute and defiant desire to live.

            <Review>The age-old search for the fountain of youth is engagingly appraised in "The Immortalists," a lively documentary focusing on a pair of very different biomedical scientists who are equally obsessed with eradicating the ravages of time.</Review>
            <Review>A very well-mounted film, with outstanding contributions in Alvarado's cinematography and Eric Andrew Kuhn's subtly expressive score.</Review>
            <Review>This sly documentary rises above its speculative hook by shifting to show the very human, and very mortal, sides of these would-be warriors of eternity.</Review>
            <Review>Should you find the prospect of immortality terrifying, as I do, the film has a vast philosophical hole at its center, and passes with only occasional spikes of interest.</Review>
            <Review>Would that the film encouraged some deeper thought on the matter instead of inviting viewers to gawk at the subjects as if they were freak-show attractions.</Review>
            <Review>Even if it doesn't convince us they're likely to conquer death before it comes for them, the film does prompt interesting debates about just how desirable an unlimited stay on Planet Earth would be.</Review>
            <Review>spending so much time on their admittedly eccentric personal lives--time that could have been used to explain more of the science and their particular theories and approaches--was not the best choice.</Review>
            <Review>Some voices of reason and skepticism do make an appearance to rebut and deflate Bill and Aubrey's monumental claims, but aren't allowed to fully elaborate on their arguments.</Review>
            <Review>[An] absorbing documentary.</Review>
            <Review>Their science is not particularly reputable (in the course of the film, one loses funding for his lab and the other leaves academia to start a research fiefdom with his own inheritance), but they are fun to watch.</Review>

            <Review>While it's no surprise that Moore is so good, "Still Alice" has an unexpected trick up its sleeve: the sweetly gentle performance of Kristen Stewart, as Alice's actress daughter Lydia.</Review>
            <Review>A modest drama, but Moore's heart-wrenching and Oscar-nominated performance makes this a must-see.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is harrowing, as any story about Alzheimer's should be, but Moore gives it an extra layer of gravity and heartbreaking inevitability.</Review>
            <Review>Sorrow-laden and moving, Still Alice isn't gratuitously grim nor is it easily sentimental. There's humor here -- vaguely gallows-like, perhaps but also earned.</Review>
            <Review>The great strength of the film is that it never resorts to cheap sentimentality. The facts themselves are hard enough, crushing enough.</Review>
            <Review>Still Alice is accurate and compassionate, and anyone who has known someone with Alzheimer's will appreciate the film's sincere intentions.</Review>
            <Review>The performances prevent the film from becoming totally generic.</Review>
            <Review>Kristen Stewart, fresh off the weird festival entry Clouds of Sils Maria with Juliette Binoche, is just as good here as ultimately the only unselfish member of this disappointing family. But come and stay for Moore, an actor for this and all ages.</Review>
            <Review>70 percent portrait of a disease/30 percent family drama, recommended as preparation/demystification for Alzheimer's-affected families, and for fans of both Moore and Stewart.</Review>
            <Review>[Moore gives a] delicate performance here as a strong woman struggling not to be reduced to pity.</Review>
            <Review>The syrupy score just adds to the cheesiness of what is a classy disease-of-the-week weepie.</Review>
            <Review>The drama offers little new to the "disease drama" genre but the whole film is lifted thanks to Moore.</Review>

            <Review>An urgent yet strangely simple and humanistic doomsday scenario.</Review>
            <Review>The low-budget Australian apocalyptic drama has such a terrific start - an adrenaline rush of panic and dread as a huge asteroid colliding with the Earth sends a wall of fire around the planet. It's a shame the movie peters out about halfway through.</Review>
            <Review>Incoherent and pointless as it is, These Final Hours moves with commendable swiftness.</Review>
            <Review>Despite its strong sense of place and a solid central performance from Nathan Phillips, Zak Hilditch's film is too blighted by the deja vu factor to stand out from the apocalyptic pack.</Review>
            <Review>In a strange way it makes a hopeful statement, arguing that redemption is still possible up until the very point we are engulfed in continent-buckling fireballs.</Review>
            <Review>Although the film lacks the bravura of Von Trier's Melancholia or the heart and humour of Don McKellar's Last Night, it does have a propulsive energy and a satisfying arc of redemption.</Review>

            <Review>It's grim but thought-provoking fare, which Hilditch handles with considerable skill.</Review>
            <Review>It's the end of the world. Finally, a legitimate reason for a man to experience emotion. We've seen this all before... except not quite so ridiculous.</Review>
            <Review>Hilditch's 'end of the world' effort is a movie that could well be a dark horse bet to be one of many people's favourite films of the year by the time that 2016 comes to a close.</Review>

            <Review>With art-heist caper Mortdecai, Johnny Depp tries his darnedest to start a kooky Austin Powers-like franchise with a side of bumbling Insp. Clouseau. But dash it all if it isn't a crashing bore, old bean.</Review>
            <Review>Mortdecai isn't particularly funny, but it's also not the Pistachio Disguisey 2015 train wreck the Internet has spent the last few months anticipating. It's brainless, but it's painless.</Review>
            <Review>Depp's strenuously unfunny performance turns a frivolous caper comedy into a grim death march to the closing credits.</Review>
            <Review>Go if you're a raging Anglophile with an afternoon to burn or you just love Depp, even at his hammiest. Otherwise, don't point this thing at you.</Review>
            <Review>The humour is puerile and idiotic, but you may laugh out loud in spite of yourself -- especially if you're familiar with the Carry On movies or the original Pink Panther.</Review>
            <Review>Daffy, dated, and precisely as intended.</Review>
            <Review>The rarest kind of awful comedy, where even the characters themselves tangibly hate the movie they're in.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is a worthy warning to Hollywood at large: if you're going to make a comedy, hire some damn comedians.</Review>
            <Review>There's nothing worse than a film that's laughing at itself while the auditorium is silent, and while Mortdecai inspires a few chuckles, it never fully delivers.</Review>
            <Review>He's a character of a bygone age of literature and film plopped down into this time and place but with no realization that anything is different. All in all, you could certainly do a lot worse for a January release.</Review>
            <Review>I have seen worse films, but I'm not sure I've seen a worse performance. And that's really saying something.</Review>

        <StoryLine>After a troubled youth and 18 years in prison, William Garnett (Forest Whitaker) is being released. With the help of an idealistic parole agent (Brenda Blethyn) and his new-found Islamic faith, Garnett struggles to rebuild his life and overcome the violent impulses which possess him. However, Bill Agati (Harvey Keitel), the Sheriff of the small New Mexico border county where Garnett is released, has other ideas. Convinced that Garnett is unredeemable and is a threat to the security of his county, Agati launches a campaign to return Garnett to prison for life. Also starring Luis Guzman, Dolores Heredia, and Ellen Burstyn. (C) Cohen Media</StoryLine>

            <Review>It'll be easy for some to dismiss this as a familiar story told all too coolly, but look closer and you'll see it has a raging heart.</Review>
            <Review>As exceptional as the acting in the picture is, and it is wonderful ... it can't entirely lift the movie from the rut it has all but plowed into by the end credits.</Review>
            <Review>The desert landscapes are gorgeously shot by Yves Cape, but "Two Men in Town" never seems to fully inhabit its setting. Nor does the schematic, occasionally clumsy story do justice to the skills of the cast.</Review>
            <Review>The setting is striking, the cast impressive. But "Two Men in Town," a drama that's built on dread and circles the question of redemption for a newly released prisoner, falls short of the mythic territory it aspires to.</Review>
            <Review>The movie's melancholic, atmospheric tone, coupled with a muted performance from Whitaker, offers a new way into the material.</Review>
            <Review>Even if the accents are questionable or inconsistent, there's still a sense of place and geography that's rare in contemporary American film. This is the county-sized world of a parolee, where everything seems small except the horizon.</Review>
            <Review>Two Men in Town is a dusty, sun bleached saunter through redemption.</Review>
            <Review>You have to get your enjoyment in bits and pieces, from the mood and the landscape and the performances.</Review>
            <Review>Erratic and confounding in its fractured storytelling, Rachid Bouchareb's first foray into filmmaking in the U.S., 'Two Men in Town,' is a mixed bag.</Review>
            <Review>Frustratingly close to something very special indeed. If only it had a screenplay to match the visuals and performances, we'd be talking about a small classic.</Review>
            <Review>Eventually fails to live up to its initial promise, but as an overview of human frailty, it contains several powerful scenes that allow the cast room to articulate complex emotions in an honest manner.</Review>
            <Review>Well-meaning film about cruel response to ex-con trying to build a new life in a New Mexico town, but not very credible screenplay undermines good starring performance by Forest Whitaker.</Review>

            <Review>"Extraterrestrial" takes the well-worn concepts of space-creature marauders and doomed party-hearty cabin weekenders and opts to fling the litany of horror and sci-fi clichés at you in the manner of monkeys well armed with dung.</Review>

            <Review>It's in the final act that the pic becomes more ambitious and interesting, though not quite enough to lift the whole from decent-time-filler status to something more inspired.</Review>
            <Review>A movie of pure, undigested clichés, set to a generic pattern of jump scares and fake-outs.</Review>
            <Review>The filmmakers want to mix comedy and thrills, but they never really hit the mark with either.</Review>
            <Review>self-consciously trashy, trope-happy inanity that is relentlessly entertaining and rather forgettable - as though the viewer too has been subjected to an alien mind-wipe.</Review>

            <Review>If the whole premise of Extraterrestrial sounds familiar, that's because there's hardly an original idea in the whole film.</Review>

            <Review>Anchored by a nicely understated performance by Seann William Scott, "Just Before I Go" effectively juggles a wealth of genuine, at times profound, emotion with quite a bit of nutty-raunchy humor.</Review>
            <Review>Lurches along a wobbly line between salacious comic nastiness and nauseating sentimentality.</Review>
            <Review>Courteney Cox's misbegotten project is a comedy-drama that, to Cox's credit, doesn't feel at all like a TV sitcom. The former "Friends" star clearly wanted something special, but sadly the result is ... this.</Review>
            <Review>Courteney Cox's directorial debut "Just Before I Go" is a "Garden State" retread in which filthy jokes gradually cede ground to sentimental slush.</Review>

            <Review>It's epic stuff, and at 170 minutes it's a commitment. Schiller seems to be blazing a trail for German über-confidence, seeing his modern man as the grand product of all that's been right with history.</Review>
            <Review>If nothing else, "Beloved Sisters" is one of the most visually striking biopics around. Too bad you have to wade through so much verbiage in order to enjoy it.</Review>
            <Review>Without at least the tawdry pleasure of a little bodice ripping, the film moves along sluggishly, even though it is well acted and handsomely shot.</Review>
            <Review>When an occasional blast of purple dialogue is triggered (such as ''Save me from my passion!''), it only makes you wish for the unintellectual bodice ripper that the movie should have been.</Review>
            <Review>If more historical movies were like Beloved Sisters, the term "costume drama" would be less of an insult.</Review>
            <Review>As lengthy and passionate as a drawn-out kiss, "Beloved Sisters" is a beautifully made romantic drama set in 18th century Germany that's smart, sensual and emotionally resonant.</Review>
            <Review>A dull film. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Making great use of a narrator, the film has a storybook quality to it. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Like the three-hour historical epics of old, Beloved is a big, chewy melodrama, filled with simmering yearning and cold sweats.</Review>
            <Review>With its heavy-breathing material, Beloved Sisters has possibilities, but veteran director Dominik Graf swerves recklessly between the arthouse and soap opera.</Review>
            <Review>Its rewards include some remarkable performances (the girls' mother, Claudia Messner, is a standout); a convincing sense of time and place; and some romantic encounters with a genuine erotic charge.</Review>
            <Review>Best executed with churning emotions and period-specific cruelties, offering director Dominik Graf something to work his fingers through instead of passively recounting Schiller's admittedly flavorful existence.</Review>

            <Review>Nobody can top Mann's urban night scenes, with their oily neon and skyscraper light grids, but for the most part this plays like Heat without the heat.</Review>
            <Review>Let's start with the fact that Hemsworth stars as the world's most brilliant hacker. Let that sink in for a moment.</Review>
            <Review>The movie's most depressing feature is its naked pandering for overseas box office. If there's one thing worse than appealing to the lowest common American denominator, it's appealing to the lowest common global denominator.</Review>
            <Review>It has a decent ludicrousness and Mann's one-of-a-kind talent for using digital photography and naturalistic light to complicate and invigorate anonymous spaces.</Review>
            <Review>Given our brave new cyber world, someone in Hollywood is going to have to come up with a better way to do it. Watching actors tap out code as big buzzing screens of digital data flash on the screen just doesn't cut it.</Review>
            <Review>The trailer had promised a fast-paced thriller. It lied.</Review>
            <Review>Mann's preference for digital film is not well served by some of Blackhat's more frenetic sequences.</Review>
            <Review>It should have been a Jason Bourne flick. Instead, it's sort of a poor man's version, so try not to think too hard about that, or the whole thing will turn mildly ridiculous.</Review>
            <Review>This is not a film about tight plotting or slam-bang action, but about style. Pure, hypnotic, mesmerizing style.</Review>
            <Review>[Hemsworth] spends much of the film tapping away on keyboards, frequently looking down at his hands - no, really, the expert computer hacker looks at his hands to type.</Review>

            <Review>"The Cobbler" is almost fascinatingly awful enough to recommend. If one subscribes to the theory that you can learn as much from a bad movie as from a good one, this one's a master class in what not to do.</Review>

            <Review>Throughout the film's 99 minutes you will find yourself wondering whether this is a genuine black comedy, a family comedy, a dramedy, a cheap-shot drama, or possibly a melodramatic modern-day superhero story about being a good Samaritan.</Review>
            <Review>Method Man is the easy standout, proving to be the most memorable piece of a film that embraces its slightness to warm hearts and lets the rest come what may.</Review>
            <Review>The quirky magic-realist conceit has great potential but co-writer/director Tom McCarthy fails to bring it to a shine.</Review>

        <StoryLine>This documentary from filmmaker Fredrik Gertten observes the legal experiences of 12 workers on a banana plantation in Nicaragua, who hire Cuban-American attorney Juan Dominguez for representation in their class-action lawsuit against corporate giant Dole Foods. The suit finds its plaintiffs accusing Dole of causing infertility en masse among their population thanks to the use of the DBCP crop pesticide - a chemical banned in the United States four years prior, but still used in Nicaragua after that ban despite Dole's full awareness of the dangers present. The legal battle itself occupies center stage; though the plaintiffs' attorney Duane Miller presents his clients as traumatized, corporately-violated victims, the attorney representing dole paints them as drunks and liars - leading to a heated, highly aggressive courtroom showdown. ~ Nathan Southern, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>With [REC] 4, Balagueró returns to the main storyline and to the kind of claustrophobic setting where [REC] really thrives, ditching the slapstick splatter of [REC] 3 without sacrificing zombie gore.</Review>
            <Review>As an above-average adrenaline-driven roller-coaster ride, which offsets its multiple cliches with raw, controlled energy, it works.</Review>
            <Review>After an underwhelming third chapter, this Spanish horror franchise largely bounces back.</Review>
            <Review>Thrilling in parts but just missing the mark in so many other aspects, Apocalypse literally ends on a confused look instead of a bang.</Review>
            <Review>Doesn't come close to eclipsing the first two entries, but is certainly an improvement over Part 3.</Review>
            <Review>There is plenty of ferocious tension here, but also some very well-pitched goofiness, with even a cameo from the Sumatran rat monkeys of Peter Jackson's proto-romzomcom from 1992, Braindead.</Review>
            <Review>sequel that, though not exactly fresh, contaminates the franchise's now established tropes with some unexpected subgenres, &amp; keeps the pot boiling on its high-stakes tensions without ever taking itself - or horror - too seriously.</Review>
            <Review>It's a less distinctive film than the oddly sweet, ultra-gory [●REC]3 Génesis - which didn't find favour with some [●REC] purists - but it keeps its pot boiling decently.</Review>
            <Review>Gorgeous star Manuela Velasco is back but the first-hand found-footage technique is not and the story has stretched entirely too far from its humble beginnings.</Review>
            <Review>[REC] 4: Apocalypse is probably the sequel you wanted after [REC 2].</Review>
            <Review>A worthy sequel with genuine scares. A nice send-off to the series.</Review>
            <Review>As chapter fours go, this is a bloody good time even if it fails to be the capstone that REC really deserves.</Review>

            <Review>Informative, but there's not much fizz to this rather flat documentary about how the bubbly is bottled.</Review>
            <Review>The premise amounts to numerous raised glasses and classical music cues, but little of this schmoozing strikes a notable chord beyond the démodé back-patting engaged throughout.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Boxing, "the poor man's sport," has long given kids from America's roughest neighborhoods an opportunity to escape violence with violence. But with success in the ring comes new fights for which there is no training: champions are made and broken in the blink of an eye, and young men thrust into the spotlight are often ill-equipped for the fame, fortune, and hangers-on that accompany a title belt. And for many, the toughest bouts are fought during retirement, when health and financial issues begin to mount. Built around the stories of heavyweight legends (C) Amplify</StoryLine>

            <Review>It's like a thesis whose next draft would be destined for greatness.</Review>
            <Review>[A] clearly sincere but achingly cliched look at what's good and bad about the sport and the society that sanctions it.</Review>
            <Review>No one documentary could ever really encompass all that's fascinating and distressing about boxing as a kingmaking sport, a violent cultural phenomenal and a shady business. The slickly made "Champs" certainly tries, with varied success.</Review>
            <Review>The historic, socioeconomic, racial and even poetic roots of pugilism are addressed, and celebs and sportwriters weigh in, but often it's the fighters themselves who best sum up the appeal of "the sweet science."</Review>
            <Review>Now and then this documentary by Bert Marcus rises above mere promotion, leaving you wishing it had tackled the sport's difficult questions in more depth.</Review>
            <Review>Each fighter gets time to tell his story, and each is candid and thoughtful (and in some moments regretful) about their histories.</Review>
            <Review>Like a young kid channeling all of the rage that comes from growing up in poverty without a mentor, Champs suffers from throwing a bunch of stuff at the wall.</Review>
            <Review>It's just hard not to imagine that it might been better as a shorter 30 For 30 episode focusing on one of the three boxers.</Review>
            <Review>Uneven and too brief for its brawny subject, Champs fails to be an affecting underdog story or an in-depth look at boxing's many problems.</Review>
            <Review>Interesting, accessible documentary about the boxing world is revealing but stymied by its own slickness.</Review>
            <Review>What really differentiates this documentary from others is that it doesn't just stick to the cliche boundaries of the backstories of the boxers, it goes into the sociological and cultural factors of boxing.</Review>
            <Review>Directing a critical eye at the sociology and predatory business of boxing, the doc is periodically interesting but also unconvincingly broad.</Review>

        <Duration>78</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Filmed for over a decade, MAGICAL UNIVERSE is a portrait of Al Carbee, an 88 year old strange and reclusive outsider artist who spends his days alone in a massive house in Maine creating art -- mostly featuring Barbie Dolls in elaborate dioramas. The documentary profiles Carbee's amazing body of work and his relentlessly creative lifestyle. Carbee's story is explored through the prism of his unlikely friendship with New York filmmaker Jeremy Workman, who unexpectedly becomes Carbee's closest friend and only link to the outside world. Far beyond just a portrait of an eccentric, MAGICAL UNIVERSE is about wonder, friendship, and the transcendent power of creativity. Its story culminates with Al Carbee's greatest triumph as an artist and a man. (C) Sundance</StoryLine>

            <Review>While Mr. Workman evidently respects Mr. Carbee's talent, he also frames his movie as a trite narrative about a kind of lovably odd acquaintance who comes out of his shell, without many incisive ideas about shaping or broadening the material.</Review>
            <Review>A whiff of the strange never quite lifts from the real-life story of Al Carbee, a Maine outsider artist who converted his ramshackle home into a cavernous diorama for Barbie dolls.</Review>

            <Review>Carbee is such a benign, downright lovable presence, and so obviously tickled by the attention, that the film doesn't seem at all exploitative.</Review>
            <Review>An odor of condescension and, eventually, exploitation inescapably emanates.</Review>

He also discovers his Japanese weapons draw suspicion from Qie (Ma Jun), who oversees all four schools and believes the new arrival is an outlaw up to no good.

            <Review>Directed by Switzerland's Stefan Haupt in a deliberate, unforced manner, "Sagrada: The Mystery of Creation" takes a satisfying three-pronged approach to this unique structure: visual, historical and reportorial.</Review>
            <Review>Zurich-born Stefan Haupt, however, interrupts his rapturous tour of this basilica with lackluster interviews.</Review>
            <Review>Employing bursts of Bach and English-language narration, this lulling, informative documentary never fully grapples with its topic's complexity.</Review>
            <Review>A peaceful and gently stirring documentary that considers faith and architecture and human achievement in something like geologic time.</Review>

            <Review>A textbook noir premise gets an overamped and undercompelling treatment ...</Review>
            <Review>The story has plenty of possibilities, though Onah rarely manages to put his own stamp on things.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately, it's not so much the story - centered around a coke-fueled murder - that compels as Onah's familiarity with his setting. He's got a great feel for the vibrancy of downtown and the diversity of its population.</Review>
            <Review>The film's visually arresting, but it's the performances that hold it all together - Short, Wilmer Valderrama, Jesse Spencer, Paz de la Huerta, Míriam Colón, and Mike Starr, with Bachleda being the real glue.</Review>
            <Review>A well-executed crime drama that, on a narrative level, finds itself too bogged down in the familiar to achieve genuine lift-off -- let alone anything memorable.</Review>
            <Review>Columbus Short and Alicja Bachleda are actually fun to watch in this lighthearted femme fatale wannabe film noir.</Review>
            <Review>This predictable whodunit proves a tad too transparent.</Review>
            <Review>You've seen it all before, way better done.</Review>
            <Review>Though the film gets more banal as it reaches its climax-most viewers will have seen it all before-Onah creates refreshing space around these familiar stories and themes.</Review>
            <Review>holds the viewer's attention and keeps him anxious to work out the mystery.</Review>

            <Review>Peculiar and abrasive ...</Review>
            <Review>Confirms director and co-screenwriter Serge Bozon as one of French cinema's true oddballs.</Review>
            <Review>The resulting clash of tones initially seems jarring, but ultimately original and invigorating.</Review>
            <Review>An overwrought experiment in cerebral slapstick that misses more targets than it hits.</Review>
            <Review>Serge Bozon's smart, surprising, marvelously realized French crime-and-sex police drama/comedy distinguishes itself with trenchant plotting, inspired framing, and performances that honor true human feeling even as they lunge into the screwball.</Review>
            <Review>As with the Golden Age American B-movies Bozon admires, Tip Top's primary concern is not with identifying the bad guy, but with smuggling in as much additional information as possible, including televised images of the unfolding Arab Spring.</Review>
            <Review>This sui generis policier audaciously balances slapstick with a fiercely intelligent probing of the still-knotty legacy of France's colonialist past.</Review>
            <Review>One minute a tense police procedural, the next a wacky Almodóvarian sex farce, this schizophrenic enterprise is more wearying than entertaining.</Review>
            <Review>Instead of finding one consistent tone and sticking to it, Serge Bozon allows the wildly hilarious and the grimly serious to uneasily coexist, exulting in the resultant clash.</Review>
            <Review>Director Serge Bozon is not sure whether he intends a linear or non-linear sex rib-tickler or noir thriller, a female buddy cop caper or a social comment. Or all of them.</Review>
            <Review>For the most part, however, the comedy feels forced, as if Bozon is indulging a rather obscure private joke.</Review>

            <Review>With strong assists from the cinematographer Zachary Galler and her ex-husband, the composer Sondre Lerche, Ms. Fastvold, previously a director of music videos, has painted a resonant tableau of dysfunction.</Review>
            <Review>Among the many unanswered questions, I ask: Where do they find this junk, and where do so many amateurs get the money to finance it?</Review>
            <Review>The Sleepwalker distinguishes itself from most entries in this angst-ridden genre by way of superb writing, smoldering performances, and hauntingly beautiful imagery from first-time director Mona Fastvold.</Review>
            <Review>None of the characters is particularly likable or admirable, leaving little opportunity for sympathy or curiosity to penetrate the constantly heightened air of psychodrama.</Review>
            <Review>Mona Fastvold's consistently intriguing debut may leave audiences feeling it's all buildup and scant payoff.</Review>
            <Review>The Sleepwalker is a good movie stuck between too much style and too little direction.</Review>
            <Review>...an assured first feature that seems to announce the arrival of impressive cinematic sensibility.</Review>
            <Review>If the finale was able to match the suspenseful buildup, the scale might have tipped to make The Sleepwalker a remarkable accomplishment, rather than a letdown.</Review>
            <Review>In attempting to subvert our expectations of the genre, The Sleepwalker concerns itself with formal details and momentary pleasures that cannot mask the film's regrettable lack of thematic depth.</Review>
            <Review>I was, much to my own surprise, engrossed in this story from pretty much the first frame.</Review>
            <Review>The film soon settles into a confident, well-staged groove, primarily because of two unambiguously terrific performances.</Review>

            <Review>It's rare to see a film, much less a genre film, in which clarity is so willfully -- brazenly -- withheld.</Review>
            <Review>Infini is a space zombie movie that features decent production design but an undecipherable plot, which is not at all helped by the pages of expository dialogue bellowed at lung-busting volume.</Review>
            <Review>This clunky, claustrophobic, Aussie-made dystopian thriller has a plot that seems to have been constructed out of odds and ends from Ridley Scott and Christopher Nolan sci-fi movies.</Review>
            <Review>Ambitious stuff but there's a lot here which simply doesn't hold up under scrutiny.</Review>
            <Review>An exposition-heavy opening gives way to a modestly effective Australian mash-up of sci-fi/horror hybrids.</Review>
            <Review>Infini is too busy generating crashes and bangs to clarify the rules of its own skin-flaying game.</Review>
            <Review>Infini displays well enough its dark and grimy vision of the future, with the realisation of industrial sci-fi technology and how people's lives become affected by such advancements, but it lacks the follow through to capitalise on its ideas.</Review>
            <Review>A smartly economical and pleasingly old-school sci-fi flick.</Review>
            <Review>Infini needs a substantial re-edit before it's worthy of an audience's time.</Review>
            <Review>Audiences acquainted with everything from Aliens to The Thing, Event Horizon to Sunshine, and even The Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Prometheus, will find few surprises in Infini's depths beyond its unwavering genre devotion.</Review>

            <Review>Like watching a car crash, with all the elegance implied.</Review>
            <Review>It would be hard to imagine a more entertaining corrupt-cop documentary than "The Seven Five," a slick and fascinating portrait of disgraced New York policeman Michael Dowd.</Review>
            <Review>It's a story you have to hear, from the guys who lived it and may never live it down.</Review>
            <Review>I think people like Russell add to the toxicity, thickening the wall that separates cops from the citizens they're tasked to protect. But maybe we need someone as plainly amoral to make a documentary as good as The Seven Five ...</Review>
            <Review>This kind of story has been told endlessly in dramatic movies and TV shows, but rarely has a film offered characters like these telling their own stories.</Review>
            <Review>"The Seven Five" has been called "the cop version of 'GoodFellas,' " which may explain why Sony has plans to produce a fictional remake. Here's hoping that version uses a better moral compass.</Review>
            <Review>Tiller Russell's fast-moving, invigorating documentary will make very gratifying viewing for fans of all those New York-set cop movies by Martin Scorsese and Sidney Lumet.</Review>
            <Review>While Tiller is clearly a little seduced by the drama of it all, he's good at exploring the moral myopia that sets in when the view from the trenches elevates loyalty to each other above protecting and serving the public.</Review>
            <Review>Utterly spellbinding.</Review>
            <Review>The talking heads approach gets a bit relentless, but it's hair-raising stuff.</Review>
            <Review>Dowd's account to camera of his misdeeds is every bit as audacious as his criminal acts. A born raconteur, he pulls the viewer in just as he did to his various accomplices.</Review>
            <Review>Told in a rush of talking heads and archive footage, this is a siren-flash of a film, charged up in the edit like a true-crime GoodFellas.</Review>

            <Review>Think of it as the "Downton Abbey" of bondage, designed neither to menace nor to offend but purely to cosset the fatigued imagination.</Review>
            <Review>It realizes this story is ridiculous in ways the book itself never could. It has an actual sense of humor.</Review>
            <Review>It's been said that the movie contains 20 minutes of sex; if this is the case, it must contain at least 40 minutes of Ana biting her lip or putting a pencil in her mouth.</Review>
            <Review>Who would have imagined that a movie about sex could be so boring?</Review>
            <Review>Girls memorize the lines! But it's not a 'Rocky Horror' type cultural event; it's a lukewarm soft-core-porn soap opera-basically 'Pretty Woman' with spanking.</Review>
            <Review>I wish it had either been much better or much worse.</Review>
            <Review>In the lacking of an engaging subjectivity, the narrative of sexual awakening falls flat.</Review>

            <Review>The unbalanced nature of the adaptation makes for a basically unsatisfying experience (Jamie, a jerk, gets his way with everything, and Cathy, a sweetheart, doesn't), but there are moments of real delight in the movie ...</Review>
            <Review>Anna Kendrick, of all-round-awesome fame, is singing again in this adaptation of an off-Broadway musical.</Review>
            <Review>It doesn't help that the songs, while solid, become repetitive in melody. And there's not a home run in the bunch. I walked out humming ... nothing from this movie.</Review>
            <Review>It's bland, earnest, and receptive, and in order to capture it, the director Richard LaGravenese thinks he needs more crane shots than Citizen Kane.</Review>
            <Review>Star Anna Kendrick's appeal is stretched to its limit here, and her lover Jeremy Jordan's character is hard to take in large doses.</Review>
            <Review>Kendrick and Jordan seem too squeaky-clean to convey the full weight of the characters' psychological baggage, yet LaGravenese's balanced, unpretentious direction allows the material to resonate all the same.</Review>
            <Review>The two leads manage to carry the day through sheer gumption.</Review>
            <Review>It feels like a music video that refuses to end.</Review>
            <Review>The chemistry between Kendrick and Jordan is what stitches the film together and makes for an entertaining if maudlin watch.</Review>
            <Review>[The filmmakers have] crafted a love story so rife with cliché and stereotype that I was completely disinterested in the central break-up of two people I despised.</Review>
            <Review>Kendrick in particular has never had a better showcase. She's always been a vivid screen presence, but when she sings she's electric.</Review>
            <Review>LaGravenese doesn't seem to have a particular vision for how to shoot or tell this particular story, so he just aims for the most straightforward method possible most of the time, and that ultimately cripples the film in ways it can't recover from.</Review>

            <Review>The fact that My Mistress looks out of place, set as it is in suburban Queensland, doesn't detract from the director's ambition and obvious promise.</Review>
            <Review>Debut director Stephen Lance makes it all look pretty enough, but the film is so staid, safe and polite it's often just plain dull. If only the film had a real taste for the transgressions it gingerly depicts, it could have been Australia's Blue Velvet.</Review>
            <Review>While it's good that Lance eschews the conventional, the question becomes, what does he have in its place? I was left unsure of the answer.</Review>
            <Review>In the story of Kate's fractured relationship with her son is a tough and potentially tender film, but Beart and her pout get in the way.</Review>
            <Review>Most of the problems in My Mistress stem from the fact that it is steeped in cliché.</Review>
            <Review>Stephen Lance takes your typically angst-ridden, po-faced Australian teen drama, and dresses it up in a full-body latex suit.</Review>
            <Review>My Mistress is a story of coming of age and sexual awakening, but there are times when it feels like little more than a sleazy take on a boy meets girl movie.</Review>
            <Review>Stephen Lance's debut feature is like a wet dream: a fantasy scenario that titillates but never reaches a satisfactory climax, despite impressive performances by Harrison Gilbertson as the obsessed teen &amp; Emmanuelle Beart as the provocative mistress</Review>
            <Review>Flaws and all, My Mistress is worth pondering, especially if you're curious about the odd place of mothers in current Australian cinema.</Review>

            <Review>Too often, moviegoers must choose between character-driven drama and edge-of-your-seat action. "Black Sea" has both, with a gripping performance by Jude Law as their nexus.</Review>
            <Review>Black Sea is a submarine thriller set in the murky depths of exactly where the title says.</Review>
            <Review>By no means a masterpiece, but a solid genre offering, a portrait of desperate men crammed together and surrounded on all sides by what one describes as "dark, cold death." What better way to escape the midwinter doldrums?</Review>
            <Review>I'm something of a sucker for submarine-movie clichés; watching this movie, I was happy the very first time I heard a disconcerting ping.</Review>
            <Review>A contemporary submarine thriller that serves the genre well.</Review>
            <Review>As the perils mount, a certain momentum takes hold, though never quite enough to justify taking up two hours' space in your life.</Review>
            <Review>It is a shame Kelly's narrative clunks and clangs along, because Jude Law is terrific as the salty Robinson.</Review>
            <Review>It's a tense and watchable tale but without any real surprises, and demands that you drown a little too much of your disbelief.</Review>
            <Review>Black Sea is an expertly crafted genre exercise.</Review>
            <Review>It's tense, blokey stuff toplined by an impressive performance from a formidably crew-cutted Jude Law affecting an impressive Aberdonian accent.</Review>
            <Review>This is a case where the dangers of the ocean depths prove far less lethal than a screenwriter with a lack of imagination.</Review>
            <Review>Black Sea is a perfectly dutiful, professional piece of work, with several creditable performances, but it's the sort of movie that doesn't have quite enough of any one thing going for it that might eclipse its influences.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>101</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Clinton Moisey is an iconoclastic, artisan action-figure designer who still lives in his mom's basement, and is, by the standards of the world, a full-blown loser. But Clinton doesn't have time to care about what others think of him; he's too busy running a yard sale where he promotes his hardboiled detective toy line with his pet cat and best friend, "Mouser." When Clinton wakes up one morning to find Mouser impaled by a crossbow arrow, he is devastated. Realizing that the local Sheriff is only interested in flirting with his mom, Clinton sets off on his own to find out who killed Mouser and why. As Clinton delves deeper into the case, he encounters a free-spirited weed dealer and part-time hair stylist to the elderly, a squeaky-clean Korean store clerk with a dark side, and a local celebrity on the verge of a nervous breakdown, ultimately uncovering a town-wide conspiracy far greater than he ever imagined. The comedic film is a modern-day film noir set in the mundane world of the suburbs.</StoryLine>

            <Review>The film's plot ... feels like a very bland character's search for a personality.</Review>
            <Review>A dead pet isn't the only inert element of "Murder of a Cat," a plodding comic caper that fails to deliver.</Review>
            <Review>"Murder of a Cat" is a pleasant enough comic thriller, though it's the lead character - not the cat - you might most want to see murdered.</Review>
            <Review>Despite the presence of actors like Simmons, Greg Kinnear and Blythe Danner, this trying-too-hard comedy is as annoying as chasing a ball at the end of a bouncy string.</Review>
            <Review>Swing a dead cat here and you'll hit a piece of limp dialogue.</Review>
            <Review>I saw it with three people. One walked out. The second stayed to the bitter end because Blythe Danner and Greg Kinnear were in it. You needn't bother.</Review>
            <Review>Forgettable, unfunny indie whodunit is fairly violent.</Review>
            <Review>There aren't enough laughs to maintain the weak plot, and it is a pity, since Murder of a Cat is really unlike anything we've seen before.</Review>
            <Review>A forced, grating snore of a contrivance masquerading as a quirky comedy. One of the worst movies of 2014.</Review>
            <Review>The (actors) deserve much better - although they do make the most of their roles, none more so than star Fran Kranz with his most entertainingly eccentric character to date.</Review>
            <Review>Murder of a Cat has an off-kilter charm, with Greene prizing humor over menace, and Clinton's maturity over plot resolution.</Review>

            <Review>Mike Leigh's biopic is so richly detailed that it feels like a documentary. Spall goes for broke in the outsize title role.</Review>
            <Review>At 150 minutes, it's a little too long but there are stretches during its course when it captivates and amazes.</Review>
            <Review>You leave "Mr. Turner," as with all good fact-based films, wanting to know more about this man and his work - and remembering that beautiful, almost touchable light, on the canvas and on the screen.</Review>
            <Review>For modern moviegoers, the earthy "Mr. Turner" may seem like slowly steeped tea with an unpleasant aftertaste. But while some are impatiently waiting for the paint to dry, astute viewers will see a cinematic landscape bloom.</Review>
            <Review>If the past is a foreign country, then "Mr. Turner" is one of the most rhapsodic foreign films you may ever see.</Review>
            <Review>Mr. Turner is no barrel of laughs. It's a barrel of life - an extraordinary one.</Review>
            <Review>Leigh's camera searches this world through slow and ponderous movements, every gesture by an actor as carefully calculated as the forceful actions Turner throws onto his canvases.</Review>
            <Review>J.M.W. Turner might well be the role Spall is forever linked to, like Sir Ben Kingsley and Gandhi. It is a virtuoso performance, but it is also great fun.</Review>
            <Review>It is by turns funny, tragic and savage, but the strongest sense both leave us with is one of wistful mourning. It's not easy being an artist.</Review>
            <Review>It is both off-putting and amusingly fascinating to watch the portrayal of the past 20 years or so of Turner's life, as a man who changed the perception of landscape artistry.</Review>
            <Review>It's certainly not a bad film, but aside from Spall's performance and the cinematography, this is one of [Leigh's] lesser works.</Review>
            <Review>Thanks to Spall's marvelous, gruntingly animalistic performance, Pope's eye, and Leigh's deep methodology, Mr. Turner gives us an immersion if not an understanding of the gnomic artist.</Review>

            <Review>Though based on a Wired magazine story, this sticks closely to the formulas of inspirational-teacher and sports-team dramas; distinguishing it from the pack is the fact that all four students who formed the club were undocumented.</Review>
            <Review>Sequences and scenes end unceremoniously, everyone in the movie seems to know each other's backstory before they're properly introduced, and mild jokes land with uncertainty.</Review>
            <Review>Spare Parts tries too hard to be a based-on-a-true-story, feel-good, crowd-pleasing, triumph-of-the-underdogs movie.</Review>
            <Review>While the appropriately titled "Spare Parts" might feel like it has been assembled from bits and pieces of other inspirational movies, that doesn't mean the fact-based drama is any less effective ...</Review>
            <Review>This blatantly big-hearted product isn't half as vibrant as the original 2005 Wired article on which it's based, and myopically neglects to address Arizona's troubling anti-immigration legislation through even a splash of hindsight.</Review>
            <Review>Despite its clunkier elements, Matsueda's screenplay is alert to details that ground the film in the day-to-day lives of young people who are American in every way but technically.</Review>
            <Review>An effective, family-friendly film with a message that provides a valuable introduction to the issues surrounding immigration reform for the next generation of voters.</Review>
            <Review>The underwater robots almost make up for a lackluster and predictable ending. [full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>McNamara's direction, his portrayal of the characters and their lives' circumstances is very superficial.[full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>A feel-good movie that would have felt even better with a shorter running time, "Spare Parts" is nonetheless an inspirational story that will warm your heart by film's end. It's far from perfect, but worth seeing.</Review>
            <Review>The movie benefits from an air of earnest goodwill and well-turned performances.</Review>
            <Review>The film is moderately powerful in its exploration of the Latino students' lives outside the classroom, yet the dominant sequences involving the competition are right off the assembly line.</Review>

        <StoryLine>THE FRONTIER is a film about communication. Or mostly at times, lack thereof. It's a story about fathers and sons, young love, disappointments and triumphs. Sean (Max Gail), a retired literature professor and civic activist, writes a letter to his estranged son, Tennessee (Coleman Kelly), a ranch hand. Tennessee is uncertain how to respond, but knowing he should see his aging father, he decides to go home. He arrives just as Nina (Anastassia Sendyk), Sean's personal trainer fresh off a bad breakup, accepts Sean's offer to move in and help him write his memoirs. The tension between father and son is ever-present. As Sean and Nina work, Tennessee avoids his overbearing father with fix-up projects around the house. One evening after Nina has gone out, Sean and Tennessee find themselves alone in the house for the first time. (c) It's Terrific</StoryLine>

            <Review>More often than not ... "Selma" focuses on the one thing we don't expect in a movie about Martin Luther King Jr. - his doubts - and Oyelowo comes through with a deeply felt and quite brilliant performance.</Review>
            <Review>This is a film about work: the work at hand, the work it takes to do the work, and, for an audience in 2015, the question of whether the work worked.</Review>
            <Review>Vivid, nuanced and, yes, timely.</Review>

            <Review>Oh, the bathos! The loony wrongheadedness of the screenplay!</Review>
            <Review>Despite the best of intentions, a career-best performance from Kevin Costner, and outstanding work by Octavia Spencer and child actor Jillian Estell, "Black or White" succumbs to some of the same stereotypes it tries to dispel.</Review>
            <Review>It may be helpful - or vexing - to think of "Black or White" as the great grandchild of "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?"</Review>
            <Review>Binder, who once made lowbrow comedies but now specializes in middlebrow dramedies, is in several leagues over his head with this story ...</Review>
            <Review>"Black or White" stumbles even as it tries to move forward.</Review>
            <Review>Costner holds it all together. While he's always been supremely watchable, as his looks succumb to middle-age spread-his acting chops have escalated.</Review>
            <Review>The title suggests there are no easy answers. So why does everything feel so tidy?</Review>
            <Review>As far as legal procedurals and family dramas go, Black or White is a minor success.</Review>
            <Review>Binder's broadness of reach becomes a kind of tonal confusion - a racial melodrama, but with cute laugh cues.</Review>
            <Review>Only Costner's salty, unselfconscious turn as a cranky codger makes the film almost bearable.</Review>
            <Review>Even if the script isn't always subtle, Costner makes his flawed protagonist vividly real.</Review>

        <StoryLine>A brother and sister -- a painter and a fighter, both artists in their own way -- are forced to flee their home, arriving in Seattle inside a shipping container. The two struggle to make their way in a new world until one day, a wealthy art dealer/gallery owner takes an interest in the sister's painting, and the pair find themselves living a dream come true. The sister loses herself in her art and the brother seizes the opportunity to express himself as a fighter. But, it really is all just a dream. Conned by her patron into forging a Van Gogh, which is purchased by a ruthless criminal with a passion for fine art, the brother and sister soon find themselves embroiled in Seattle's criminal underworld and a Brush With Danger.

            <Review>Though not entirely an original concept, this vibrantly shot, East-meets-West fusion of Wushu and Washington never feels like a cheap forgery.</Review>
            <Review>Although the characters repeatedly express their worship of "original art" in gilded frames, the script consists of singularly unoriginal dialogue.</Review>
            <Review>Brush With Danger's few action scenes, all poorly choreographed, do nothing to extenuate the film's offensive characterizations.</Review>
            <Review>There's precious little here that hasn't been done better before, at least when it comes to the martial beatdowns.</Review>
            <Review>Brush with Danger appears to mean well...But the movie's laudable message is undermined by some terrible acting.</Review>
            <Review>This is the kind of film that starts a war between my head and my heart. But filled with youthful energy and enthusiasm, Brush with Danger is more enjoyable as a milestone in the development of its creator, Livi Zheng, than for its current reality.</Review>

            <Review>Like so many filmmakers before him, Levasseur doesn't seem to grasp that in the horror genre, less can be more.</Review>
            <Review>If you're looking for cheap scares and have 90 minutes to kill, you could do worse than The Pyramid. But not a lot worse.</Review>
            <Review>The air inside the pyramid isn't the only thing that's stale in this ludicrous yet mildly likable horror film.</Review>
            <Review>A stinker in every sense.</Review>
            <Review>"The Pyramid," despite an unpretentious matinee vibe, is mostly interesting in seeing how little light can be on screen before a bare minimum of suspense and coherence dissipates. There is, truly, not much to see in this movie.</Review>
            <Review>It's hard to know what's worse, the under-lit "found footage" from the documentary team or the wretched dialogue.</Review>
            <Review>The growing emphasis on infighting and puzzle-solving only exacerbates the movie's less-than-captivating vibe...</Review>
            <Review>As far storylines go, this one is as gormless as they come.</Review>
            <Review>Despite its 'found footage' presentation, this is an amusingly unpretentious genre exercise, more akin to the old-school monster movies, mummy's-curse chillers and gory body-count shockers of decades past than to the shaky-camera thrillers of today.</Review>
            <Review>There are absolutely no surprises here, but in a tale of this type, that's not necessarily a flaw.</Review>
            <Review>The Pyramid is nothing but a tiresome, lazy, unoriginal, and downright badly made "found footage" horror film.</Review>
            <Review>Found footage films are the bane of my existence. They reward lazy filmmakers and punish eternally optimistic movie audiences.</Review>

            <Review>Gout undermines his own spiky, ambitious narrative with all the visual interference, as dazzling as it often is.</Review>
            <Review>"Days of Grace" is a potent and vigorous film. It may not illuminate the depths or explore the causes of Mexico's crisis, but it mines that crisis for memorable images and dramatic scenes.</Review>
            <Review>Most of this frantic moviemaking is more disorienting than riveting.</Review>
            <Review>The dizzying narrative pings hither and thither, with first-time director Gout confidently deploying different screen ratios and film stocks to remind the audience where they are in the timeline.</Review>
            <Review>It does have enough action to be entertaining and it will give a lot more to the viewer who can work out the style intricacies.</Review>
            <Review>The best Mexican splatterfest since Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia!</Review>
            <Review>Eventually, the film's impressive array of formal pyrotechnics overwhelms its morals.</Review>
            <Review>This is all very impressive in its scope and moral reach, and the movie, with its extensive use of handheld cameras, sweaty close-ups and violent encounters, is visually striking.</Review>
            <Review>It may feel more like pulp than art house, but it still maintains its grip, bound together by a score composed by Nick Cave, among others.</Review>
            <Review>So confusing (especially if you're a football dolt) that you may have trouble identifying the different narrative strands. It's still gripping.</Review>
            <Review>There are characters who help to connect the stories and provide a straight line through a very twisted narrative. In its best moments this is an exciting, involving multi-story thriller.</Review>
            <Review>It's a confident, well-made film that ends up in a blind alley of cynicism.</Review>

            <Review>Frivolous stuff, but there's a sour edge to the silliness, with far more gay panic colouring the jokes than you'd expect from the director of 'The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.'</Review>
            <Review>Vulgar, trite comedy filled with drug use and sex.</Review>
            <Review>What really got on my nerves, more than the appallingly bad jokes and sight gags, is the terrible music that haunts the film from start to finish.</Review>
            <Review>From most vantage points, A Few Best Men seems like a real movie. It has a "story," "characters," &amp; even scenes that superficially appear to contain "jokes," but many sketches are ultimately just that; sketches that stop short of offering moments of wit.</Review>
            <Review>An out-and-out failure.</Review>
            <Review>A largely unfunny blend of frantic farce and gross-out humour.</Review>
            <Review>This Australian Hangover-style ensemble comedy strains so hard to be funny that it barely raises a smile</Review>
            <Review>Director Elliott (Priscilla Queen of the Desert) tells this story with an odd combination of tourist-bureau style backdrops and full-on slapstick mayhem</Review>
            <Review>When it eventually does let loose and go for some big gross out laughs - like feeding a sheep laxatives - it starts to work, but it's too little too late.</Review>
            <Review>When embarrassment fails to be funny, it ends up as truly excruciating, and such is the case here.</Review>
            <Review>This stomach-churningly dreadful film proves that our friends in the Southern Hemisphere can scrape corners of the barrel inaccessible to even the most fetid American imaginations.</Review>
            <Review>No question this is dumb and derivative and the characters are generally obnoxious but it's raucous, energetic and enlivened by a game Olivia Newton-John ...</Review>

        <StoryLine>France, in the 1760s. Born into a bourgeois family, Suzanne (Pauline Etienne) is a beautiful young girl with a natural talent for music. Despite her faith, she is dismayed when her parents send her off to a convent, expecting her to become a nun. Suzanne first resists the rules of the convent, but soon finds out that she is an illegitimate child, leaving her no other option than to pronounce her vows and suffer the consequences of her mother's sin. Adapted from Diderot's eponymous novel, The Nun tells the story of a woman trying to resist imposed religious values, revealing the dehumanizing effect of cloistered life.</StoryLine>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>Measured and sensible, The Nun lacks the full-on claustrophobic horror of a film like The Magdalene Sisters and moves through events at a matter-of-fact distance.</Review>
            <Review>Pauline Etienne as the heroine is a harmonising centre, believable, luminous, quiet-spoken, poignant.</Review>
            <Review>It's an affecting and frank take on the loneliness of faith as well as faithlessness, whose horrors come in odd contrast to the plush production values.</Review>
            <Review>It's a generally classy yet dramatically underpowered affair traversing a steady path between respectable costume drama and habit-lifting exploitation.</Review>
            <Review>Looks as tasteful as can be but, in terms of emotion, lacks any kind of finesse.</Review>
            <Review>Guillaume Nicloux has, alongside Jérôme Beaujour, crafted a stately and atmospheric adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel, which is driven onwards by a powerful central female performance.</Review>
            <Review>With impressive production design and a strong script, this is an engaging, well made French period drama anchored by a superb performance from Pauline Etienne, though the tone wobbles in the final act and the ending is curiously abrupt.</Review>
            <Review>This Isabelle Huppert drama starts promisingly, but sadly reveals itself as a piece of hackneyed nunsploitation.</Review>
            <Review>This is dark but comedic, with plenty of frills beneath the habit.</Review>
            <Review>A strangely drab adaptation of Diderot's much racier novel.</Review>
            <Review>Though Etienne and Huppert are fantastic, Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel is neither nunsploitation nor chamber piece, just about working as a sermon on hypocrisy.</Review>
            <Review>Nicloux escalates Suzanne's travails at just the right pace, wrestling his final act back from "The Perils of Pauline" territory to conclude with an shocking suggestion which brings the material's themes back to the forefront.</Review>

            <Review>Indulgent and movie-like, Lost River is Gosling's weird, let's-do-this-thing folly. If it is a statement, it is one made by borrowing the vivid styles of the actual filmmakers he seems to admire ...</Review>
            <Review>Designed to daze and confuse, and succeeding, Ryan Gosling's directorial debut is a stunner in visual terms alone.</Review>
            <Review>Ryan Gosling is a tremendously talented actor, but he should really leave the storytelling to someone else.</Review>
            <Review>"Lost River" is one of those weird films that I think some people will absolutely adore, grabbing on to its performances, imagery, and ideas, without really caring that they haven't been stitched together in an interesting enough way.</Review>
            <Review>"Lost River" is indeed a mess, but it's the best mess possible, an evocative grab-bag of images and moods with a heartfelt sincerity and conflicting impulses of romantic melancholy and hardscrabble hopefulness.</Review>
            <Review>Lost River is little more than "cool shots, bro."</Review>
            <Review>While 'Lost River' might not be a model of narrative efficiency, it's got more striking moments and memorable images than a season of studio product.</Review>
            <Review>Either you will hate it for being pretentiously artsy or love it as a mesmerising mess.</Review>
            <Review>Lost River is a hugel y impressive debut, even if it is ultimately flawed. It feels like a first feature, and that's OK, and displays an art and eye from Gosling you might not have thought he possessed.</Review>
            <Review>That Gosling is so serious about his inconsequential pronouncements, makes this mess more of a mess.</Review>
            <Review>It all descends into blood and fire as Gosling sifts through his Blu-ray collection to share the images and moods he loves. Does it work as a movie? Nah, not really. But as cinematic mix tapes go, it's kind of cool.</Review>

            <Review>A visually pleasing film, given to framing the characters in dappled sunlight that peeks through windblown leaves. It's a pity the rest of the project is so poorly executed.</Review>
            <Review>Watching lifelong friends, clearly destined for each other, miss the romantic boat over and over is entertaining at first, but soon their tortuous and silly road to the inevitable provokes only impatience.</Review>
            <Review>Love, Rosie succeeds well enough on its own, largely due to the fabulous chemistry between the leads, who bring their flawed, well-rounded characters to life in a funny, warm and amiable manner.</Review>
            <Review>The two leads have absolutely no chemistry. Claflin (The Hunger Games) has Hugh Grant's chiselled jaw but none of his comic flair, while Collins comes across as yet another doe-eyed English rose.</Review>

            <Review>All three actors turn in solid, committed performances despite physically limiting surroundings, even as you're left with the inescapable feeling that this raft has sailed.</Review>
            <Review>Director Brian Falk, who co-wrote the script with Mark David Keegan, worked well with cinematographer Petr Cikhart to keep the story visually interesting, despite the limitations placed on the tale by the monotonous setting.</Review>
            <Review>A groaningly tedious survival story that will at least leave you with a renewed commitment to wearing sunscreen.</Review>
            <Review>Made on a fraction of the budget, "Against the Sun" works more effectively than Angelina Jolie's "Unbroken."</Review>
            <Review>Eventually all the movie has is the talent and chemistry of the three actors; fortunately, that's enough to keep it afloat.</Review>
            <Review>Tremendously inspirational. It's more thrilling and engrossing than Life of Pi.</Review>
            <Review>A good old-fashioned story of American wartime heroism that's ironically less jingoistic than the major-studio release American Sniper.</Review>
            <Review>Overly familiar, but still slightly more moving than "Unbroken," which covers some of the same nautical territory.</Review>
            <Review>Against The Sun goes with the path of least resistance: a talkfest where the men reiterate every obstacle they face out loud.</Review>

            <Review>When the eponymous couple is together, 'Amira &amp; Sam' is an earnest and considerate examination of two people falling in love, but the movie lacks certainty when handling these characters separately.</Review>
            <Review>The script is thoughtful, but its anger is diffuse, with laissez-faire capitalism and the problems of illegal immigrants and returning soldiers jostling for attention.</Review>
            <Review>Chief among its pluses is the low-key warmth of leads Martin Starr and Dina Shihabi.</Review>
            <Review>"Amira &amp; Sam" is all over the map in terms of tone. But it does score a few points as an unusual tale about the casualties of war.</Review>
            <Review>This indie drama is unconvincing as a love story and heavy-handed in its message of tolerance.</Review>
            <Review>It gets by on low-level sweetness and guile until delivering an unexpectedly powerful emotional sucker-punch at the end.</Review>
            <Review>A kind of counter-narrative, free from partisan political commentary, Amira &amp; Sam takes the smart high ground</Review>
            <Review>A nice little movie that you might well enjoy, if only you'll give it a chance.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director Sean Mullin's first feature is genuine and human.</Review>
            <Review>Charming performances by the well-cast leads, Martin Starr and Dina Shihabi, compensate for a clunky, contrived, sitcom-ish screenplay.</Review>
            <Review>This modestly affecting romance doesn't exactly break any new ground, but its character-based approach allows it to sidestep some of the usual clichés.</Review>
            <Review>A delightfully engaging, convention-busting slice of of-the-moment America that is far from the typical culture-clash romantic dramedy.</Review>

            <Review>Such miserable people; why should we care? Maybe because Ceylan does.</Review>
            <Review>The easy gag about the 196-minute "Winter Sleep" is that it's so good it makes 3  1/2 hours feel like two, but that's no joke.</Review>
            <Review>These scenes are talky, yes, but what talk!</Review>
            <Review>"Winter" feels very much like an epic novel, mirroring the pacing and themes of Chekov, whose work was its inspiration.</Review>
            <Review>Think of it as dramatic slow-cooking where the ingredients take their time to come together.</Review>
            <Review>Ceylan spins gold in thought and image, set to the mournful strains of Schubert's Piano Sonata No. 20, with this impeccably acted morality tale of a wealthy man who sins by omission.</Review>
            <Review>Winter Sleep progresses Ceylan's ever-evolving narrative and aesthetic strategy into what proves his most emotional and dramatic work.</Review>
            <Review>The formidable running time will doubtless deter many, which is a shame: Winter Sleep is never less than richly engrossing, even if some scenes, stretched too long, take on a didactic, even slightly hectoring tone.</Review>
            <Review>It's possible to admire it, but it's hard to imagine anyone truly enjoying it.</Review>
            <Review>There's no melodrama in this film, only beautifully observed moments worthy of Chekhov and Bergman.</Review>
            <Review>Ceylan's deeply observant, quiet epic might leave you detached at first, but this is the kind of work that aims to creep up on and haunt you in the long haul, in many not instantly recognizable ways.</Review>
            <Review>This well-observed drama takes its time telling its narrative, as it adroitly gets to concerns over the human condition.</Review>

            <Review>Aside from a brief and uncritical preface by Columbia University professor Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, there's no attempt to contextualize Fanon's book.</Review>
            <Review>With not nearly enough signposts along the way to indicate where we are, either in time or place, it's an intimidating argument to follow, despite Olsson's rigidly organized structure.</Review>
            <Review>On both levels of the film, the archival and the textual, there's much that's fascinating and worthwhile. What's regrettable is the refusal to contextualize and explore the ongoing ramifications of what we see and hear.</Review>
            <Review>The energy here feels more like that of a lecture than of a film; it's an analytical tonic that's potent to the point of bitter.</Review>
            <Review>Its exploration of an entrenched system that breeds generations of oppression and violence is extremely upsetting yet still highly rewarding.</Review>
            <Review>Göran Hugo Olsson's profound essay doc aspires to upset in the truest sense.</Review>
            <Review>A collage of archival footage, carefully curated to create a provocative think piece.</Review>
            <Review>A meditation on Frantz Fanon's plea to oppressed people to use violence against their colonial oppressors.</Review>
            <Review>There are extraordinary images on display here. But it's difficult to understand why this film has emerged now.</Review>
            <Review>Olsson's The Wretched Of The Earth excerpts are well-chosen, and several of the vintage interviews from Swedish TV are jaw-droppingly on-point.</Review>
            <Review>In many cases, Fanon's astringent words seem as relevant today as ever.</Review>
            <Review>Here is a film that isn't afraid to risk didacticism in order to put across its vision of the debilitating physical and psychological effects of colonialism.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>The film is visually bland, with only a couple of bookending outdoor sequences around a handful of interior sets.</Review>
            <Review>It smoulders and smokes and generates some heat but it never really bursts into flame.</Review>
            <Review>Anyone interested in spellbinding performances, however, should see Miss Julie.</Review>
            <Review>Morton, one of the least artificial actresses in the world, charts her character's heartbreak without any of the self-pity normally assigned to ordinary women.</Review>
            <Review>What Ullmann's done is create the ideal conditions for these three to do electrifying work with each other. She maintains control so they can lose it.</Review>
            <Review>"Miss Julie" is a rather strange experience, with its consistently static medium shots of the three actors, as they roar their lines at one another. But it has an undeniable power.</Review>
            <Review>Miss Julie's acid dialogue and sardonic twists burn down to the bone of costume drama's fattened arm, its darkness closer to original-series Upstairs Downstairs than to polished one-percenter porno Downton Abbey.</Review>
            <Review>Altogether, it is a classy production, but it rarely gets past the outward forms and down to the inner truths.</Review>
            <Review>Chastain is as brittle and fragile a Miss Julie as ever there was.</Review>
            <Review>It starts off as a will-they-won't-they as to whether Chastain's baron's daughter will sleep with Farrell. It ends up as a will-they-won't-they ever shut up. Should have been called Shouting Miss Julie.</Review>
            <Review>Farrell and Morton are solid, but Chastain's sensational - and Ullmann is canny enough to simply let her rip.</Review>
            <Review>In maintaining the period setting, Ullmann hasn't found a way to make the themes feel particularly relevant and, despite the committed performances, the intended naturalism of the play feels too theatrical on film.</Review>

            <Review>This is a powerful and effective documentary that exposes facts about the nature of war that the military establishment would rather keep secret. It serves as a reminder about the high levels of corruption in the military.</Review>
            <Review>Its extraordinary story can hardly help but involve and outrage.</Review>
            <Review>All is not fair in love and war, but the battlefield can be a place where the lines begin to blur.</Review>
            <Review>Explosive and depressing.</Review>
            <Review>Is the story of The Kill Team singular? That's the unspoken question that hangs over this award-winning documentary, another artifact from the "war on terror."</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>I suppose the relationship is Oedipal or primal or something or other, but mostly it's just an excuse for Dolan to stage a series of gaudy shout-fests.</Review>
            <Review>A story of the combative relationship between a mother and her son filled with delirious swells of effusive love and sudden plummets into madness and hate.</Review>
            <Review>Dolan is able to weave dialogue, camerawork, a fluid yet urgent editing style, and a magpie's ear for pop music into a cinematic world that you can almost hold in your hand before it starts spilling over.</Review>
            <Review>The movie's overlong, underpopulated and often devastating to watch. But it's told with an uncanny realism, and when it's over you feel shaken and a little sick - and realize that you can finally exhale.</Review>
            <Review>Mother and son gesticulate wildly but remain undefined; Dolan's blandly showy aesthetic matches the vainly hectic action.</Review>
            <Review>Dolan is only 25, and though he doesn't have Orson Welles beat, this has to be one of the best films ever written and directed by a 25-year-old.</Review>
            <Review>In Mommy, Dolan has essentially stunted his work, speaking both figuratively and literally.</Review>
            <Review>Mommy forces you to give in to its relentless energy. Dolan conducts it with gusto, leaving us with a cathartic reckoning with his own demons.</Review>
            <Review>It's perhaps a never-seen-before technical stunt that's deeply intriguing, seriously cinematic and impossible to discuss without giving it all away.</Review>
            <Review>Xavier Dolan's Mommy is an endurance test even by the standards of miserablist drama.</Review>
            <Review>You can see the talent that lies beneath Dolan's aggressive method, and the promise of something great in his future.</Review>
            <Review>A work of haunting power.</Review>

            <Review>Jennifer Lopez has serious beefcake issues in this lazy, low-budget, not-as-much-fun-as-it-should-be potboiler.</Review>
            <Review>It's all hilariously ridiculous, but bless J.Lo for trying her mightiest to sell it. If someone's going to bring sultriness to suburbia, it might as well be Jenny from the Block.</Review>
            <Review>I haven't seen a bigger mess in wide release since Dana Carvey's career-terminating The Master of Disguise.</Review>
            <Review>There are many grades of terrible in Hollywood, and this is pretty nearly the worst.</Review>
            <Review>It's badly directed, poorly edited, and features some of the most unconvincing acting this side of a soup commercial.</Review>
            <Review>You always have to wonder why anybody says yes to a project like this one, but it's a particularly strange choice on Lopez's part, since she's done her best work in movies that dare to empower her.</Review>
            <Review>There's 'funny-haha,' and 'funny-strange,' but the howler that is 'The Boy Next Door' lands solidly in the category of 'funny-please-just-shoot-me-now.'</Review>
            <Review>The Boy Next Door plays best as unintentional comedy.</Review>
            <Review>This is a marvel of bad editing and if that fascinates you, you might enjoy yourself; otherwise, I'd steer clear.</Review>
            <Review>Occasionally it veers into the "so bad it's good" category, but that doesn't change the fact it's very, very bad.</Review>
            <Review>The Boy Next Door comes off more as an inadvertent comedy than the thriller it's supposed to be.</Review>
            <Review>Lifetime-ready have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too crap about a victimized woman turned righteous avenger in the last five minutes</Review>

            <Review>Authoritative and exhaustive. A must-watch.</Review>
            <Review>The film is rich in archival-memory and first-person recollections of many key figures, of higher and lower or no rank at all.</Review>
            <Review>There's nothing innovative in the filmmaking, it's simply a gracefully told story - tense here; poignant there - with strong detailing.</Review>
            <Review>Archived film of the final, chaotic push to clear the embassy compound by helicopter is as dramatic as any thriller, heightened by stories of bravery and risk.</Review>
            <Review>A testament to people, as one source puts it, "doing their best under terrible circumstances."</Review>
            <Review>This is both a gripping suspense story and a profound moral drama.</Review>
            <Review>It's a fascinating saga of institutional denial and personal commitment - both of which are somehow bound up in the personal arc of Graham Martin.</Review>
            <Review>Totally unbalanced film. The North Vietnamese army becomes the symbol of invading barbarians when as Walt Kelly put it, "We have met the enemy, and he is us."</Review>
            <Review>Paints a true-life picture of ordinary people with human consciences defying their orders and the law to do the right thing when bureaucracy fails them.</Review>
            <Review>Good, but too narrow in focus and somewhat biased in those whose voices the filmmakers chose to share</Review>
            <Review>If voters are already tired of the red-state/blue-state reductionism in the dialogue surrounding American Sniper and Selma, Last Day's conventionality may turn out to be an asset.</Review>
            <Review>[A] disarming documentary about the fall of Saigon, a movie that is as much about human decency as diplomatic incompetence.</Review>

            <Review>The dialogue never leaves the surface and the running across Los Angeles that happens in the last sequence is supposed to thrill you, but it's such a cliché that your embarrassment extends to the crew member who has to follow with the camera.</Review>
            <Review>Though Wahlberg is a fine actor, there's no way I can buy him as a college English professor holding forth on Shakespeare and Camus.</Review>
            <Review>The hopeful ending comes off as too little, too late. Wahlberg gives the role his all, but sticking with him is a futile gesture. The Gambler never pays off. It's a sucker's bet.</Review>
            <Review>As The Gambler becomes less about its protagonist's dashed intellectualism and more about the gathering danger of his predicament, the film gains power.</Review>
            <Review>An agreeable if ridiculous slice of old-school Hollywood machismo ...</Review>
            <Review>It's just like the Kenny Rogers song says: "You've got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em." It's time for this "Gambler" to walk away.</Review>
            <Review>Some casting decisions should never happen-Shaq as Tinkerbell-hmm... actually that might be fantastic, scratch that. But Mark Wahlberg as a professor of literature? Just no.</Review>
            <Review>'The Gambler' is just shy of a great movie - it doesn't quite add up like it should - but it is a reminder that there's a very fine actor lurking in Mark Wahlberg.</Review>
            <Review>This remake not only fails to justify its own existence, it very nearly calls into question the necessity of the material in any form.</Review>
            <Review>Watchable scene-to-scene as an old-fashioned character study.</Review>
            <Review>Mark Wahlberg is intense and compelling... but his character's self-destructive behaviour strains the viewer's sympathy almost as much as it strains that of the people around him.</Review>
            <Review>A lame remake of the 1974 original, this Gamble doesn't pay off</Review>

            <Review>The plot's old, the title's borrowed and the jokes are blue - but there's nothing remotely new in this wearying bromantic comedy.</Review>
            <Review>Screenwriters Jeremy Garelick and Jay Lavender don't even try to make the premise seem plausible; rather, they use it as a springboard for screwball complications and verbal humor.</Review>
            <Review>What saves the film are its two leads, who aren't afraid to show their sensitive sides -- along with other parts of themselves.</Review>
            <Review>The Wedding Ringer feels spat out for people who love Katherine Heigl movies but wish that Eddie Murphy were in her role instead.</Review>
            <Review>A mostly disposable, occasionally quite funny bromance distinguished at times by its earnestness.</Review>
            <Review>Hart rants, Gad fidgets, and together this pair barrels through the plot, shaping between them a surprisingly potent friendship.</Review>
            <Review>It's a pleasant experience, if not a revelatory one, and the chance to see a part of the world we'd otherwise never know.</Review>
            <Review>An incompetent comedy that must have either gone horribly wrong or simply started with a low bar.</Review>
            <Review>Mostly funny but ultimately forgettable.</Review>
            <Review>While I agree studios historically save January to release their not-so-entertaining movies, Hart and Gad make you laugh simply by showing up. Add a moderately funny script, and The Wedding Ringer is a winner</Review>
            <Review>Loudmouth Hart swears copiously, while the tubby Gad gets pitched into a series of undignified scrapes that usually end with damage to his genitals. Laughs, though, are few and far between.</Review>
            <Review>Jeremy Garelick has a clever title and an amusing premise, and the movie benefits from the teaming of Hart and Gad. But the picture suffers from Garelick's inept direction.</Review>

            <Review>The true-life horse-racing tale "50 to 1" takes forever to get galloping - and when it finally does, it's too little too late.</Review>
            <Review>If "50 to 1" were about 15 minutes shorter, all of this might have made for a passable diversion. As it is, "50 to 1," much like Mine That Bird, flags before reaching the finish line.</Review>
            <Review>Wilson has owned and raced horses for years and once had a 190-acre ranch in California. And he has made the kind of film he might have seen as a kid, one where patience and hard work get rewarded at the 11th hour.</Review>
            <Review>Though infinitely more real than the symbolically bloated Seabiscuit of over a decade ago, 50 to 1 never completely gets under the skin of horse racing.</Review>
            <Review>Earnest but cliche-ridden...you're left with the feeling you've seen it all many times before, and needn't have seen it again.</Review>

            <Review>A respectable screen version of Michael Bond's classic children's books.</Review>
            <Review>It manages to be both old-fashioned and high-tech. It remains faithful to the character's roots while also placing him firmly within a contemporary setting. It's charmingly funny and shamelessly punny.</Review>

            <Review>Although the themes could be serious, they're played out with a delightfully light tone.</Review>
            <Review>While it is light and fun and frivolous, the storyline never loses sight of the theme of finding your home and it is an enchanting take on Michael Bond's iconic character.</Review>
            <Review>Celebrates the spirit of his creator with a film that's both witty and enchanting.</Review>
            <Review>It's a pleasant surprise to see a family film proliferate a powerful message like this.</Review>
            <Review>Paul King's Paddington is a very British movie, and that's mostly good, though it briefly succumbs to the sort of lazy humor that derailed the equally Anglo Boxtrolls.</Review>

            <Review>If the adaptation's a little too faithful to sustain a cinematically tight story, there's still a lot to admire in the sheer, uninhibited folly of the whole thing, the gall to get groovy while the Oscar-watchers are on high alert.</Review>
            <Review>Anderson moves further from conventional storytelling with each new film, and closer to something more intuitive, more damning, more true. He hasn't made it there yet. God help us when he does.</Review>
            <Review>Some storylines conclude, some collide, others dissipate. But the film's main crime is this: It's boring.</Review>
            <Review>Joaquin Phoenix is perfectly cast as the perpetually befuddled Doc, a private detective of sorts who immerses himself in pot in the Los Angeles of 1970.</Review>
            <Review>Although it's not as hermetic and impenetrable as The Master, Inherent Vice still comes off as a giant inside joke to anyone who hasn't read Pynchon's novel.</Review>
            <Review>Inherent Vice is a sun-glared, neon-limned muddle of noir plotline and potheaded jokery that not only doesn't make sense, but actually seems to try hard not to.</Review>
            <Review>Inherent Vice is a bizarre, almost dreamlike, movie, one that makes sense from moment to moment but falls apart the second you try to tie it all together.</Review>
            <Review>After a decade spent making two films that are like pressure cookers, Anderson was clearly ready to blow off some steam.</Review>
            <Review>Its avalanche of idiosyncrasies might make it tough sledding for general audiences, but for trippy, glassblown noir, "Inherent Vice" is a prime cut.</Review>
            <Review>Once you let the chaos of all the eccentric characters and the mystery Doc is trying to solve, wash over you, you start appreciating it, but if you question it and try to corral it, the film just slips away from you.</Review>
            <Review>Anderson's greatest display of formal elasticity.</Review>
            <Review>Viewers looking for a coherent narrative won't find it in this chaotic film.</Review>

Selling off her engagement ring, Catherine moves back to her family home in Woodstock, to get back to what she has always wanted to do: write music. One night at a local bar, Catherine stumbles into handsome town doctor Noah (James Wolk), and cannot deny the moment of magic between them. Little by little, Catherine starts to find herself, and write music, with the help of local legend, Lee Ann (Katey Sagal). As she and Noah start to fall in love, Catherine realizes that becoming successful means becoming your true self first. (C) Gravitas Ventures</StoryLine>

            <Review>Even by its genre's comfort-food standards, this movie feels blandly circumscribed, almost child-proofed, as if any sharper reality or wit might be harmful to the intended audience.</Review>
            <Review>Unfortunately, Merson clutters her sometimes soulful, sensitive story with too many formulaic contrivances to impede Catherine's personal and professional progress.</Review>
            <Review>This is a movie that runs on magical thinking.</Review>
            <Review>Another week, another benign rock and roll romance.</Review>
            <Review>Any film justifies its existence when it gives Katey Sagal a chance to sing.</Review>
            <Review>Jason Ritter's the best thing about the film, genuinely funny as a vapid but well-meaning fool-actor. His hysterically crying, post-sex monologues are hilarious.</Review>
            <Review>Catherine's journey towards acknowledging she's no better than any of the people she silently screams at in frustrated rage becomes a pit of quicksand.</Review>
            <Review>Listless romcom has flat characters, drinking.</Review>
            <Review>Just like its lead character, the film can't decide what it wants to be when it grows up.</Review>
            <Review>The film uses its setting as lazy shorthand: for the nostalgia of lost childhood, the virtues of independence, and the spiritual purity of acoustic rock.</Review>
            <Review>Katey Sagal as a reclusive folk-rock star and the still magical setting aren't enough to recommend this thinner-than-thin musical romance.</Review>
            <Review>In some ways, almost all the characters in Always Woodstock are stock characters, but the acting made them exceptional (particularly James Wolk). The folk-music-filled film is a charming, enjoyable romantic comedy to watch.</Review>

            <Review>[Peter Strickland's] new movie has more going on than cinematic mind games.</Review>
            <Review>There's voyeurism, fetishism, bondage, lingerie and high-flown naughtiness galore, but that's hardly the movie's most conspicuous achievement.</Review>
            <Review>The Duke of Burgundy is no mere style exercise or slavish homage. Strickland finds both humour and pathos in the situation of Cynthia and Evelyn, who are every bit as trapped as the insects they collect and catalogue.</Review>
            <Review>This is voyeurism of a brilliant, deeply refined order. If the MPAA had a shot at rating Strickland's fantasy, they would try to condemn it without being able to explain why.</Review>
            <Review>A tiny, tasteful throwback to more innocent times, when actresses with exotic names would strip off their costumes while embracing far-fetched scenarios - and one another.</Review>
            <Review>It's an impressive achievement: the rendering of a private and extremely particular world in terms that any lover will understand.</Review>
            <Review>Some of the most sophisticated filmmaking of the year married to one of the most humane, insightful stories.</Review>
            <Review>It's a visceral experience that begs multiple viewings not to necessarily understand meaning, but to wrap your head around the abstraction.</Review>
            <Review>It would be interesting to see how a daring female filmmaker would follow the story's fetishized elements toward their logical trajectories.</Review>
            <Review>This is a very well acted movie with an interesting plot. The relationship between Cynthia and Evelyn is very complicated and interesting.</Review>
            <Review>The core of psychological believability is what lifts Duke out of the category of "pretty pastiche."</Review>
            <Review>The Duke of Burgundy has many deeper, richer shades of complexity than the Hollywood bodice-ripper currently exercising control of the box-office.</Review>

        <Duration>123</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Superstar violinist David Garrett makes his acting debut as the legendary and notorious Italian violinist and composer Niccol� Paganini whose talent was so great he was called "The Devil's Violinist." Paganini is at the height of his career and under the strong control of his manager Urbani (Jared Harris), who will risk anything and anyone to bring Paganini to England. Urbani's plan, helped along by a British couple and a newspaper writer Ethel Langham (Joely Richardson) is brought to fruition as Paganini conquers the crowds of London and the hearts of women. When he falls in love with a young singer, Urbani must find a way to separate them and keep his hold on the larger than life superstar. This turbulent tale of love, lust, power, and the lure of fame is set against a glorious score by David Garret and composer Franck van der Heijden. (C) Freestyle</StoryLine>

            <Review>Beautiful and thoughtful.</Review>
            <Review>Though his dramatic performance is somewhat too mild, classical-pop violinist David Garrett brings an electrifying musical authenticity to the lead role in "The Devil's Violinist."</Review>
            <Review>Even if, like me, you're a sucker for men with tossable hair and precision eyeliner, you can't help noticing that "The Devil's Violinist" is hysterical - and possibly historical - hooey.</Review>
            <Review>Garrett, making his acting debut, isn't a strong enough presence to carry the nonmusical sequences.</Review>
            <Review>David Garrett's musical gifts far outstrip his acting chops in Bernard Rose's creaky 19th-century melodrama.</Review>
            <Review>[Garrett's] handsome and fiddles something fierce, but his acting aptitude is more "Chopsticks" than Caprice no. 24 in A minor.</Review>
            <Review>Violin prodigy and classical crossover artist David Garrett can certainly play. Acting is a little iffier.</Review>
            <Review>Potentially there is a portrait of the artist in crisis buried beneath all the histrionics and parables. As it is, The Devil's Violinist is simply tone deaf.</Review>
            <Review>Florid, hysterical (though far from historical) pseudo-biographical movie about the famous violinist [Paganini].</Review>
            <Review>A hilariously histrionic depiction of 19th-century superstar violinist Niccolò Paganini's rise to fame, far more Monty Python than Mozart.</Review>
            <Review>The melodramatic script includes plenty of historical liberties, but at least it doesn't take itself too seriously.</Review>
            <Review>The latest classical-music legend to have his life trashed-again-by a cheaply sensationalistic movie, this famed fiddler deserved way better.</Review>

            <Review>I don't think I've ever seen a smarter, warmer, more honest depiction of human sexuality than this roundrobin of emotion and attraction. I love this movie.</Review>

            <Review>"The Great Gatsby" Lite screenplay by Antonio Macia hasn't the sharpness of satire or the momentousness of an American tragedy, veering instead toward middling melodrama.</Review>

            <Review>"Affluenza" thinks it is deep when it is merely trite. It illuminates nothing.</Review>
            <Review>Straining to find a correlation, even metaphorical, between teenage hedonism and economic collapse, "Affluenza" never coheres.</Review>
            <Review>A stilted, utterly phony drama of rich-kid angst that thinks it's saying something about the hidden perils of privilege but is actually just an exercise in wheel-spinning inanity.</Review>
            <Review>Wealthy young people party in overly ambitious drama.</Review>
            <Review>Though it prefers F. Scott Fitzgerald's voice to any whisper of its own, Affluenza is well-acted and often cutting and canny in its condemnation of entitled, apathetic youth.</Review>

            <Review>Handsome-looking but all-too-familiar drama about wealthy Long Island teens with too much money and time on their hands makes no inroads into the adolescent angst that afflicts the silver-spoon set.</Review>

            <Review>What's not to love, after all, about a therapist who calls a mentally unbalanced man crazy to his face? But it's also an appropriate response to both Walter the movie and Walter the ridiculous construct of a movie character.</Review>

            <Review>Feels something like gathering a team of master chefs to make a breakfast of corn flakes and Tang.</Review>
            <Review>Walter isn't quite like anything you've seen before. Shot partly in Indianapolis on a shoestring budget, this quirky comedy is one of the best films out right now.</Review>
            <Review>The slow compromise of this perfect world, and Walter's increasingly messy interactions with other human beings (Madsen and William H. Macy are especially good), provide both laughs and heart.</Review>

            <Review>The slack and purposeless direction leaves the entire cast emoting in a void.</Review>
            <Review>Jennifer Aniston burrows into Claire's walking-wounded gait and eclipsed mood.</Review>
            <Review>Cake could have used more layers.</Review>
            <Review>"A thoughtful and frequently moving drama that insightfully illuminates what it's like to live with illness and agony."</Review>
            <Review>This Cake isn't fallen. It's just a bit deflated.</Review>
            <Review>Think 'Nurse Jackie' reincarnated as a lawyer. The blatant Oscar-bid timing reduces the effectiveness of Aniston's performance rather a lot. It manufactures high expectations.</Review>
            <Review>Despite a formidable and kaleidoscopic performance, there is a sense that the themes of human frailty and the will to heal that inform the film's narrative are beyond Aniston's abilities as a serious dramatic actress.</Review>
            <Review>In Cake, [Aniston]'s stiff, suffering, and suicidal, your mostly unwelcoming hostess for an extended pity party of personal tragedy.</Review>
            <Review>Writer Patrick Tobin and director Daniel Barnz have a made a movie that, despite the clichéd template, manages to hold your interest. The main reason for that are the fine performances, mainly by Aniston who pilots this thing.</Review>
            <Review>Aniston isn't the only one doing good work... It's a shame the script lets them down in the end, too.</Review>
            <Review>Cake usefully reminds us that Jennifer Aniston can actually act. I wish she'd do it more often and in better movies than this one.</Review>

            <Review>Nicholas Musaraca's excellent cinematography contributes a number of fine effects, and there's a strange and witty aside on the invention of movies.</Review>
            <Review>While the film has a tendency to wander into unadulterated Hollywoodisms in spots, it is a generally straight-forward and imaginative estimate of a two-century-old sociological theme.</Review>
            <Review>Robson's notably unpoetic direction doesn't help, either; yet few Hollywood films ever had such ambition.</Review>
            <Review>Why the Brits banned this creepily effective Boris Karloff thriller for fifty years is unclear.</Review>
            <Review>A weak end to a great career [for producer Val Lewton], but not, in and of itself, a bad movie.</Review>
            <Review>Lewton had something to say. Perhaps inevitably, he found less interesting ways of saying it over the course of nine films in a short four years.</Review>
            <Review>The feminist-political fable is couched in absorbing grey zones</Review>
            <Review>Another strong chiller from brilliant producer Val Lewton.</Review>
            <Review>As a sociological tract it's right on the money, as a psychological thriller it wanders at times too far away from the money.</Review>
            <Review>Quote not available.</Review>
            <Review>Notable only for a nuanced performance by Boris Karloff.</Review>
            <Review>A fine feature in the Val Lewton series for RKO is not so much a horror film, though it does contain one of Karloff's more deliciously sadistic performances.</Review>

            <Review>As much as my conscience wanted to empathize with the characters, my taste only wanted to be rid of them.</Review>
            <Review>Nothing feels forced in this movie, which is testament to Colangelo's skill as well as the cast's. You believe the coal dust on these people; you grieve for their secrets.</Review>
            <Review>Little Accidents paints a vivid portrait of a community facing an imminent existential crisis.</Review>
            <Review>To her credit, the writer-director tries for complexity. Now if she can just get the storytelling to match the quality of the filmmaking, I suspect there will be fewer little accidents.</Review>
            <Review>Owen tries with lurching uncertainty to ease back into normal, even as the writer and director Sara Colangelo clutters his path with enough obstacles to challenge the most heroically determined traveler.</Review>
            <Review>There's a quiet desperation to all the lives depicted in writer-director Sara Colangelo's assured indie about a West Virginia mining accident that upends everyone in town.</Review>
            <Review>A strong start. A nice finish. But, a little lacking in the middle. Still, there's plenty to like about "Little Accidents."</Review>
            <Review>Colangelo doesn't make it easy, but she doesn't cheapen the viewing experience, preserving the delicate observational atmosphere of her accomplished directorial debut.</Review>
            <Review>Despite some strong performances, the potentially intriguing set of blue-collar characters isn't explored with much depth.</Review>
            <Review>Slow, somber drama about secrets has drinking, language.</Review>
            <Review>Colangelo's directorial prowess is evident through her beautifully framed shots and the strong performances she elicited from her actors. Put her down as a filmmaker to watch, as you watch her debut film.</Review>
            <Review>This well-intentioned melodrama creates a number of potentially compelling figures, only to shove them into contrived corners that undermine the film's sense of authenticity.</Review>

            <Review>Feeding over-the-top language to underdeveloped characters, Deon Taylor's "Supremacy" dramatizes racism with an unvarying intensity that quickly becomes wearing.</Review>
            <Review>The film plays out almost like a conventional Hollywood hostage thriller but for the incendiary, racially charged subtext.</Review>
            <Review>It's so grueling an ordeal that its revelations barely penetrate the murk.</Review>
            <Review>[A] dour, dreary drama ...</Review>
            <Review>'Supremacy' might function as a 'Clockwork Orange' type therapy for death-row white supremacists.</Review>
            <Review>A pretty preposterous plotline, but who am I to argue with a tale presumably based on a true story?</Review>
            <Review>To make a movie about Aryans, you really need to have some sort of psychological insight into what makes them tick. Supremacy lacks any such insight, which makes it watchable, although never especially impactful.</Review>
            <Review>Supremacy is a well-acted, abysmally written, deeply unpleasant exercise that pays no dividends of insight for the chore of enduring its endless racial epithets.</Review>
            <Review>The characters shout themselves hoarse, but they don't really say anything, and it isn't long before we feel like hostages ourselves, bound by the filmmakers' strained moral outrage.</Review>

        <StoryLine>At first glance, it is not obvious that Abigail Evans lives with a life-threatening skin disease. She is a typical teenager: moody, rebellious, irreverent, and is also strikingly beautiful. But her life is the antithesis of normal. Abbie grew up in hospitals, cared for by her protective mother and father. She then came into her own in honky tonks, selling merchandise for her dad's band. But just like any other 18 year-old, Abbie yearns for a life of her own. Butterfly Girl charts Abbie's journey towards a new understanding of how she must balance her past with her future, her parents with her independence, and her disease with her desires. But what price must she pay for that freedom?</StoryLine>

            <Review>The film's brutality - which includes not only the murder of a dog but also a fetishization of torture that borders on porn - is so excessive, even if tongue-in-cheek, that it leaves a bad taste in the mouth.</Review>
            <Review>If the film does anything right, it reminds us that now-48-year-old Hayek is one heck of a forceful presence when she is allowed to be.</Review>
            <Review>Feels precision-engineered for a morally torn fanboy who likes the idea of female empowerment but needs it served with a heavy dose of torture porn and glistening flesh.</Review>
            <Review>Salma Hayek plays a sex slave turned killer in this stylish but lumbering actioner.</Review>
            <Review>What on earth is Salma Hayek doing starring in this exploitative, junky piece of torture trash?</Review>
            <Review>There's the pervasive feeling that this is a prefab cult film that doesn't need to try too hard, instead offering cosmetic variations from a very limited playbook of gestures meant to provoke Pavlovian cries of "Awesome!"</Review>
            <Review>There are some genuinely great action bits mixed in with a handful that are a bit more tired, and the overall package is full of ups and downs.</Review>
            <Review>Despite his and Hayek's best efforts, the result is sloppier than the mess Everly creates, blowing up a lift full of Yakuza.</Review>
            <Review>Those with an adolescent nostalgia for video-nasty era degradation/retribution may be mildly titillated, but Lynch has neither the wit nor desire to raise this above the level of faux-retro fanboy fantasy.</Review>
            <Review>There are references to Leon, Kill Bill and Se7en, plus a whole lot of Japanese men in sharp suits -- leading to a distinct whiff of déjà Woo.</Review>
            <Review>Lynch shows some visual flair with a few clever, Tarantino-like touches but the film overall is a deadening and claustrophobic experience, in which the human interest diminishes as rapidly as the body count rises.</Review>
            <Review>A relentless onslaught of violent action, this movie is notable mainly because there's a woman at the centre of it, which means that it's entertaining even if it's rather pointless.</Review>

            <Review>Amirpour's debut feature is striking and excellent, though sometimes too self-congratulatory and too much in love with its cultural references. But one thing is for sure; Amirpour is on her way to becoming a great director.</Review>
            <Review>... the film, shot in high-contrast black-and-white widescreen almost entirely at night, is like an Iranian film noir by way of a crime drama with supernatural edges.</Review>
            <Review>Amirpour - shooting in black-and-white widescreen in southern California, for a little extra unreality - has built a marvellous world that offers room to wonder about the characters and their lives.</Review>

        <StoryLine>RICKY MILLER a sweet 40-plus manager of a Denny's type restaurant gets his prayers answered when he joins a dating site and meets DANITA - an impossibly beautiful woman who shares all his interest. He soon learns there's just one little catch - she's married and he has to kill her evil husband. Ricky shrugs - there's always going to be SOME baggage when you're both around 40. Ricky's best friend SETH finds out her monster husband is actually an ex-Rabbi who proves to be generous and affable when they finally meet him. Ricky is torn. Is Danita telling him the truth? Or is Seth right and she's a femme fatale like Kathleen Turner in 'Body Heat' who's playing Ricky? (C) Gravitas Ventures</StoryLine>

            <Review>An offbeat rom-com that ventures down the film-noir path, "Hit by Lightning" manages to make dark comedy fresh by combining two formulas.</Review>
            <Review>"Hit by Lightning" often resembles a laugh-deprived "Seinfeld" episode.</Review>
            <Review>From its uninspired, sitcom-y look to its phoned-in dialogue ("I love you plus infinity"; "I love you plus double infinity") to its creaky plot, "Hit by Lightning" is anything but electrifying.</Review>
            <Review>Cryer makes a likable sad-sack and Will Sasso provides balance as his narcissistic best friend. But both guys deserve better. As do we.</Review>
            <Review>It's a black-comedy plot without any blackness or actual comedy, unless mugging and bro-heiming by Mad TV's Will Sasso counts as hilarious.</Review>
            <Review>Never gets past mildly amusing, finding Blitt unwilling to spin the effort dizzy with madcap encounters and pitch-black comedy.</Review>
            <Review>Hit By Lightning might have worked as black comedy, but Blitt clearly lacks any instinct for genuine darkness.</Review>
            <Review>[A] turgid, static, ineptly made first directorial feature from Blitt.</Review>
            <Review>Jon Cryer plays another lovesick loser, only this one can swear and gets mixed up in a lame "murder my husband for me" comic thriller</Review>
            <Review>The film's first half is at least amusingly intriguing, but interest expels quicker than air in a popped balloon once true motives are revealed.</Review>

            <Review>Forest Whitaker turns in one of his sleepiest performances; no one else seems to be trying very hard either, yet director Olivier Megaton delivers some good chases, fist fights, and shots of Neeson looking glum.</Review>
            <Review>A movie that thinks the way to earn our knuckle-biting is to be as dull as hell for 35 minutes, then send a giant shipping container hurtling along the interstate. But you yawn through that, too.</Review>
            <Review>Nothing gets taken here except your ticket money.</Review>
            <Review>All you need to know about Taken 3 is that Liam Neeson survives an explosive car crash - twice.</Review>
            <Review>The logy screenplay, by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen, sags under head-clutchingly banal dramatic scenes. Only Mr. Neeson's appeal somehow survives unscathed, perhaps the most impressive stunt of all.</Review>
            <Review>Here it's the audience that gets taken.</Review>
            <Review>It's Neeson that franchise fans will come back for. And although his lethally protective father routine has run its course, it's been fun watching the old bloke make the most of it.</Review>
            <Review>Its hilarious, mind-bendingly stupid climax is nearly worth the price of admission alone.</Review>
            <Review>Taken 3 isn't a bad time; it's often laughable without veering totally into self-parody.</Review>
            <Review>What a spectacular way to ruin a great character. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Taken 3 may be this movie's title, but the only thing taken here will be your money if you decide to pay to see what is the worst film in this franchise.</Review>

            <Review>"Life Inside Out" is a gentle, poignant drama whose heart and head are squarely in the right place. Engaging, naturalistic performances and nicely explored real-world issues add to this absorbing film's down-to-earth appeal.</Review>
            <Review>The earnest film's straightforwardness and down-to-earth characters have a gentle appeal, but its tendency to spell out every emotion and theme in on-the-nose dialogue undercuts its potential impact at nearly every turn.</Review>

Join the Sheriff with his son, and a motley crew of survivors as they weather confrontations with zombies, meet up and then leave their tattered camp-a partially destroyed shopping mall. The group journeys to the supposed Safe Haven Rand seeking shelter from the owners, a fascinating and diabolical older couple. Along for the ride with the still-human survivors is a lone zombie who begins to see and develop his human side when he looks up with the brash female leader. The unexpected twists and turns and will delight those who enjoy over-the-top blood spattering while horror movie buffs will appreciate the George Romeroesque touches.

            <Review>It's a slop bucket of lazy writing and uninspired jokes...If you want to laugh at zombies, seek out Zombieland instead.</Review>
            <Review>A one-star rating is too high, but it's the lowest we can give.</Review>
            <Review>Fittingly brainless parody, but sadly lacking wit, subtlety and humor, it proudly carries the torch of such crimes against comedy like 'Disaster Movie' and 'Epic Movie.'</Review>
            <Review>The actual parody parts, and attempts to lampoon the specific movies and TV shows, of The Walking Deceased don't work. It's better when it just settles into a straight comedy.</Review>
            <Review>A self-congratulatory collection of feeble meta-awareness just dopey enough for adolescents to mistake for clever comedy.</Review>
            <Review>So deprived of laughs (not to mention brains), it makes Meet the Spartans and Vampires Suck look like Airplane! or Hot Shots.</Review>
            <Review>Zombie movies are horror's low hanging fruit, and zombie parodies the lowest of low hanging parodies. Whatever its shortcomings, hhy would anybody spend more than it cost to make this one?</Review>

            <Review>by the final act neither the jokes nor the plot of the film are working</Review>
            <Review>This juvenile horror-comedy spoof is primarily, if unintentionally, a cautionary tale about the perils of allowing brahs to make movies.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>Whaley has made a provocative, well-acted movie about infatuations that turn awkward, but he struggles with the ending.</Review>
            <Review>Whaley aims high for this sort of material, but his film, sweet as it is, gets a little too precocious.</Review>
            <Review>Whaley nicely calibrates this wistful dramedy's emotional quotient, never allowing sentiment to turn into sap. He also smartly dials down Reggie's initial precociousness to reveal a kid who's deep, resourceful and strangely sensible.</Review>
            <Review>It's a bittersweet story that thins out toward the end as it turns too obviously sentimental, but it's still a nicely etched tale of the intersection of two unrelated lives.</Review>
            <Review>Unsurprising given its laughably affected title, Like Sunday, Like Rain boasts what may be the most insufferably precocious protagonist in cinema history.</Review>
            <Review>A playful tone and passable performances can't overcome an unremarkable premise and predictable plotting.</Review>
            <Review>The same listless scenes play over and over (park, restaurant, cello, etc.), with odd editing lurches between them.</Review>
            <Review>A tender and heartfelt drama about the friendship between a 20-something nanny and her brainy 12-year-old charge.</Review>
            <Review>Gossip Girl royalty Meester does opposite side of the tracks raw and real here, when it comes to emotional domestic violence, economic class divisions and youth financial struggles today. But the incessant background music is this film's own worst enemy.</Review>
            <Review>If only Whaley...possessed any singularity of vision, perhaps this rote film would have had a similarly lasting effect.</Review>
            <Review>Perhaps the best picture Whaley has made to date, able to find purpose and meaning in this friendship, disrupting a formulaic structure with an earnest appreciation of personality.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Glasnevin Cemetery is the final resting place of 1.5 million souls; it is Ireland's national necropolis. ONE MILLION DUBLINERS reveals the often unspoken stories of ritual, loss, redemption, emotion, history - and the business of death. But this is really a film about life: the Saint Valentine's Day rush in the florists; the American visitors eagerly searching for Irish ancestors; lost and longed for love; discovery and bereavement; earthy gravediggers and musicians in celebration. Above all, it's the story of an immensely engaging Tour Guide shepherding his charges - and us - through the headstones and monuments, through opinions and beliefs. Filled with the familiar and the fascinating, this is a documentary that offers a glimpse into the unknown, into a world we will all come to share. Often humorous, always affecting, ONE MILLION DUBLINERS explores life, death and the afterlife, and ends in a way that will stay with you forever. Even in a cemetery you never quite get used to death.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Playing out like The Crow meets I Spit On Your Grave with a Native American twist, Avenged is frenzied, ferocious, and a bloody good revenge story.</Review>
            <Review>a mixed breed of torture porn, supernatural action and beyond-the-grave romance. Though played entirely straight and often unnervingly nasty, it is also undeniably silly,... without once bothering to find any tonal consistency</Review>

            <Review>"Living Is Easy With Eyes Closed" is subtle in the truest sense, in that it says and suggests much, and does so definitely, but through a minimum of means.</Review>
            <Review>Javier Camara, best known here for his work with Pedro Almodovar, is quite good as the teacher, delivering a performance of real tenderness and depth. In Spanish with subtitles.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately good-hearted and gracefully handled enough to transcend the leisurely slightness of its material.</Review>
            <Review>The actors help to bring this engaging tale to life.</Review>
            <Review>An evocative portrait of a time and a place and also a subtly rewarding character study of three ordinary people in search of that extraordinary dream, a taste of freedom.</Review>
            <Review>Smart and delightful ...</Review>
            <Review>A throaway road-movie, well acted, somewhat funny, but in the end it's just pretty standard. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Cámara's performance is excellent, suggesting a deep melancholy that's only hinted at in the script.</Review>
            <Review>While the stakes of the film may not be particularly high, you can't help but feel invested in the journey.</Review>
            <Review>It's a project that could easily be weighed down with nostalgia or over-determination, but there's a generosity and humour about the performances and the direction that keep the film light and buoyant.</Review>
            <Review>The central performances overcome the conventional material to offer relatable characters on a universal quest, with the always excellent Camara a perfect guide through pleasant territory.</Review>
            <Review>Their adventures are the subject of a delightful feel-good movie that skilfully combines humour, sentiment and tart political commentary.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Faye Dunaway stars in Michael Winner's labored re-make of the 1945 swashbuckler, which was co-scripted by Leslie Arliss, the original director of the 1945 film. Dunaway is Lady Barbara Skelton, a lady of the royal class, who becomes a highway robber, taking up with Captain Jerry Jackson (Alan Bates), a highwayman and her lover. Because of a notorious whiping scene in which Lady Barbara and Jackson's girlfriend (Marina Sirtis) take horsewhips to one another, tearing their clothing to strategically-placed ribbons, the film was held back from release because Winner refused to cut the salacious footage. After corralling author Kingsley Amis, and directors John Schlesinger, Karel Reisz, and Lindsay Anderson to attest to the redeeming social value of the scene, the scene stayed in the film. ~ Paul Brenner, Rovi</StoryLine>

While in the Argentina capital on a day the whole population is waiting to view a rare solar eclipse, she must also find a new tenant for her family's decrepit apartment. Rapidly losing her patience waiting for one applicant, she runs into the mysterious Jorge lurking outside the front door of the place who informs her that he has a client willing to pay four times what she is asking in rent. There's one catch - the paperwork must be signed immediately. As greedy Marga waits to complete the transaction, several of Jorge's associates suspiciously appear at the apartment ready to strip the wallpaper. And what's behind the decor signals a startling fate worse than death - or should that be life! -- (C) IFC</StoryLine>

            <Review>There are several reasons to stay with "Penumbra" until the bloody end. Cristina Brondo makes this bitch-on-wheels likeable. She is a remarkable actress. And, the directors (Garcia Bogliano brothers) know how to build suspense. C'est bizarre!</Review>

            <Review>Burton had a chance to make a powerful statement on the struggle for a woman to achieve artistic recognition and instead settled for another childlike fairy tale.</Review>
            <Review>A feminist psycho-melodrama made without insight or dramatic excitement.</Review>
            <Review>Amy Adams and Christoph Waltz are charismatic in the lead roles; occasionally they distract from the movie's overall smugness.</Review>
            <Review>For all its tonal shifts and erratic pacing, the film is Burton's heartfelt tribute to the yearning that drives even the most marginalized artist to self expression no matter what the hell anyone thinks.</Review>
            <Review>Burton might need to get further from blockbuster bloat in order to regain his formal mastery of kitsch. Right now his sense of comic portraiture is too easily mistakable for splatter painting.</Review>
            <Review>Adams is lovely and tremulous, but Big Eyes would be even better if Waltz was in the same key.</Review>
            <Review>Burton's uninspired made-for-cable vibe and Christoph Waltz's overly manic performance always feel at odds with each other.</Review>
            <Review>Big Eyes is Tim Burton's second foray into strange but true stories of American termite art culture... a story about the pain behind the façade of happiness and success.</Review>
            <Review>A lovingly crafted, uncommonly astute look at gender roles in American families.</Review>
            <Review>A bitter feminist fairy tale about a woman betrayed by love and trust and crafted by culture to be vulnerable to the charms of a con-artist husband.</Review>
            <Review>Bright yet disturbing, Big Eyes is both an indicator of just how far women have come in the past 60 years and a comment on the commercialisation of pop culture.</Review>
            <Review>With a kind of quiet reserve, Big Eyes is a rare effort from the Tim Burton that plays it straight.</Review>

        <StoryLine>In 1983, a group of childhood friends pulled off the crime of the century: kidnapping one of the richest men in the world, the heir of the Heineken beer empire (Anthony Hopkins). The shocking capture--by gunpoint in broad daylight on the streets of Amsterdam--resulted in the largest ransom ever paid for a kidnapped individual. It was truly the perfect crime...until they got away with it. Based on a true story, KIDNAPPING MR. HEINEKEN also stars Anthony Hopkins, Sam Worthington, Jim Sturgess and Ryan Kwanten.

            <Review>One capably staged chase sequence apart, it's not one to set the pulse racing.</Review>
            <Review>Not only is Hopkins's Freddy incomparably more charismatic than any of his captors, he's the only one who, weirdly enough, seems to be enjoying the ordeal. But maybe that's simply a matter of pay scale.</Review>
            <Review>The true story of Freddy Heineken's kidnapping is fascinating, but "Kidnapping Mr. Heineken" is a disappointingly superficial film in which neither the kidnappers nor their captives are particularly interesting.</Review>
            <Review>The sole object lesson in the true-crime drama "Kidnapping Mr. Heineken" is that not every crime deserves its own movie.</Review>
            <Review>Despite its true-events pedigree, "Kidnapping Mr. Heineken" is woefully captive to B-movie crime saga tropes.</Review>
            <Review>Anthony Hopkins and a cast of erstwhile next-big-things go slumming in Daniel Alfredson's listless, fact-based kidnapping caper.</Review>
            <Review>It's far from perfect, but Kidnapping Mr. Heineken still proves to be a generally likable and engaging small-time thriller, regardless of its imperfections.</Review>
            <Review>Hopkins in captivity is always fascinating. He is not Hannibal Lecter-dangerous here, but as a stubborn captive in chains, he is still a defanged alpha male worth watching. If only we were allowed to see more of him.</Review>
            <Review>The stakes might be high, but never once do they produce even a frisson of delight, horror or tension.</Review>
            <Review>Time and again, good material is introduced and discarded.</Review>
            <Review>While the ransom paid was the largest ever, the stakes never seem as high as they should be.</Review>
            <Review>It fails to accentuate the peculiarities of its from-the-headlines tale and instead turns itself into a rather generic and predictable kidnapping thriller.</Review>

            <Review>Must be plenty of space between the ears of the guy who thought up this horror flick. Perhaps that's why it's called "Echoes."</Review>
            <Review>Echoes is a perfectly good-enough ghost story that shines a noteworthy spotlight on the inherent horrors of sleep paralysis.</Review>
            <Review>Thanks to a lazy and amateurishly-written screenplay, Echoes is nothing but a bland horror offering that is more likely to bore you rather than give you the slightest chill.</Review>
            <Review>Puts its horror elements on the back burner for a shaggy, nonsensically developed supernatural murder-mystery involving characters who are the diametric opposite of brainy.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>86</Duration>
        <StoryLine>In the 1990's, singer-songwriter Milan Mumin, the lead singer of the hugely influential Serbian rock band, Love Hunters, electrified and gave voice to a generation of Serbians fighting an oppressive regime. Now, after ten years, we find Milan in New York City, driving a taxi (long shifts and loopy fares), cobbling together funds for a recording session of his dream album-to be recorded and released in America. When his bass guitar player suddenly quits, he finds a talented but prickly replacement, and a romantic spark, in a free-spirited guitarist named Kim. Just as rehearsals start picking up steam, Milan's longtime Serbian girlfriend Lela arrives with very different plans for their future-she wants him to come home to Serbia where his reputation will let him be anything he wants-but Milan is determined to make his recording-in America, at any cost.

            <Review>The film's a sad, gentle valediction for a young artist's dream.</Review>
            <Review>The premise might remind you of John Carney's Once, but this is grittier and less sentimental, grounded in disappointment and working-class drudgery.</Review>
            <Review>Love Hunter is consistently engaging, mainly thanks to its star's winning personality.</Review>
            <Review>In its feel for nocturnal light, this is one of the most refreshing New York independent features since Ramin Bahrani's "Man Push Cart."</Review>
            <Review>Lots of bittersweet charm, but lacking some reality checks. Like hey, the American dream is currently located under the rubble of the ongoing economic crisis in progress. Not to mention how US bombs buried Serbia under rubble 16 years ago this week.</Review>
            <Review>All else rings true: creativity versus personal commitment, sacrifices for your art which might not pan out, the scintillating but sometimes scuzzy New York scene.</Review>

        <Duration>92</Duration>
        <StoryLine>ANTARCTICA: A YEAR ON ICE is a visually stunning journey to the end of the world with the hardy and devoted people who live there year-round. The research stations scattered throughout the continent host a close-knit international population of scientists, technicians and craftsmen. Isolated from the rest of the world, enduring months of unending darkness followed by periods when the sun never sets, Antarctic residents experience firsthand the beauty and brutality of the most severe environment on Earth. Capturing epic battles against hellacious storms, quiet reveries of nature's grandeur, and everyday moments of work and laughter, this unique documentary shows a steadfast community thriving in a land few humans have experienced. Using specially modified cameras and spectacular time-lapse photography, filmmaker Anthony Powell captures the splendor of the region like no film before. ANTARCTICA: A YEAR ON ICE gives testament to the planet's natural wonders, humanity's thirst for adventure, and the emotional extremes that accompany a year within the last pristine wilderness on the planet.

            <Review>Way too much screen time is given over to folks describing what it's like to live in such a place, as opposed to, you know, actually living there.</Review>
            <Review>"Antarctica" ultimately does evoke a sense of the place - its magnificent emptiness and inhuman, unspoiled purity.</Review>
            <Review>It is the simple glimpses of ordinary life in an extraordinary place that are the most stirring moments in the film.</Review>
            <Review>Powell makes excellent use of time-lapse photography to capture such natural phenomena as a sea freezing over. What registers most strongly, though, is the sense of loneliness and professional drudgery.</Review>
            <Review>Mostly what you get is a chronicle of tedious routine carried out in a killing climate. That gives this documentary a flavor that is strong and genuine. Just not very appealing.</Review>
            <Review>A documentary that's essentially a tribute to a hardy group of people who've made a life on the ice.</Review>
            <Review>Technically, it is far superior to an average installment of PBS's Nature, but it has the same general niceness and similar tacked-on messages.</Review>
            <Review>Under incredibly harsh conditions, Powell captures the outstanding beauty of the ice, the active volcano near McMurdo, the wildlife, the ice-cold water and the amazing night sky with stars so bright, it's almost blinding.</Review>
            <Review>If nothing else, watching the documentary "Antarctica: A Year on Ice" makes a Wisconsin February go down a little easier</Review>
            <Review>You'll want to wear a sweater to the theater.</Review>
            <Review>Powell doesn't let tiny details slip by.</Review>
            <Review>The movie shows precisely what the title suggests: the changing seasons in that desolate place, and the folks who decide to endure them.</Review>

            <Review>I'm attaching four stars more out of helplessness than critical acumen, by the way; if the film is beyond language, it's certainly beyond a traditional rating system.</Review>
            <Review>Throughout this enigmatic film's short running time, I couldn't for the life of me make out what Godard was trying to say.</Review>
            <Review>A film that's stuffed with language, its title notwithstanding.</Review>
            <Review>Anyone interested in the possibilities of the moviegoing experience - what can happen in a dark theater - owes it to themselves to say hello to "Goodbye to Language."</Review>
            <Review>At 84, Godard is still looking for new ways to express himself, though he thinks it harder than ever to achieve meaningful interpersonal communication in the information age.</Review>
            <Review>Jean-Luc Godard is the acknowledged mascot, if not master, of intellectual cinema. In "Goodbye to Language 3D" the 84-year-old auteur... reprises his longstanding suspicion that words are worthless.</Review>
            <Review>Language is gone. The new cinema has arrived.</Review>
            <Review>The 3-D aside, there is nothing in "Language" that has not been done before and done better.</Review>
            <Review>The film offers a resounding experience for anyone remotely interested in the way we watch movies.</Review>
            <Review>Working in 3-D for the first time, Mr. Godard pushes the envelope and - depending how you look at it - trolls the format for all its worth.</Review>
            <Review>A hugely entertaining and almost entirely inscrutable lark, with a punk rock air of both surrender and rejuvenation.</Review>
            <Review>Put in short, the film is chaos, but glorious, wondrous chaos that lets us see what genius looks like from the inside.</Review>

            <Review>The movie is like a milk shake so sweet that you want to keep drinking, even as you begin to gag.</Review>
            <Review>It's adorable. It's also very thin.</Review>
            <Review>Browning, staring down the camera and singing up a storm, brings buckets of soulfulness to a script that might not be terribly deep.</Review>
            <Review>At 90 minutes, this material might have sped through. Coming closer to two hours, it drags.</Review>
            <Review>God Save The Girl is an overly sentimental and drawn out experience whose stylistic pastiche of musicals is less clever than it thinks it is.</Review>
            <Review>Come for the movie, struggle through the story, and embrace the tunes.</Review>
            <Review>Two hours whose every restless minute is felt, no matter how fetchingly and frequently the stunning Emily Browning croons directly to the camera.</Review>
            <Review>It's trying to go for the rainbow, the big magic, a thunderbolt of release, but never quite hits the mark.</Review>
            <Review>I can't help but have a pooling soft spot shy of a puddle of swoon for "God Help The Girl," the expectedly twee but crazy-charming lovable coming-of-age musical written and directed by Stuart Murdoch, also known as the lead singer of Belle &amp; Sebastian.</Review>
            <Review>Too cute at times, but ultimately kind of charming.</Review>

In the Philippines, he first entered the ring as a sixteen year old weighing 98 pounds with the goal of earning money to feed his family. Now, almost twenty years later, when he fights, the country of 100 million people comes to a complete standstill to watch. Today at the height of his career, he is faced with maneuvering an unscrupulous sport and political duties, while still maintaining a personal life.

            <Review>A narrow and borderline fawning hagiography that will no doubt find great favor among his fan base, while inspiring shrugs of indifference from those less invested in his tale.</Review>
            <Review>It makes for a choppy, unsatisfying portrait when any topic outside the worshipful career momentum and expected dazzling fight footage - personal demons, his growth in a corrupt sport, the weight of being an icon - is addressed.</Review>
            <Review>Banal, stentorian narration by Liam Neeson ("Once victory is stolen from you, what are you left with?") mostly gives the sense that it's the viewer being carried around the ring.</Review>
            <Review>Only a fool would say it to his face, but eight-time divisional boxing champ Manny (Pacman) Pacquiao has a limp swing as a documentary subject.</Review>
            <Review>Even as a promotional piece, Manny is too thin a nonfiction portrait of Manny Pacquiao, one of the greatest boxers of the modern era and the only one in history to win titles in eight different weight classes.</Review>
            <Review>Pacquiao's the only boxer in history to win championships across eight weight classes. His story follows the classic Hero's Journey stages precisely, blow-by-blow, as it were.</Review>

            <Review>A potential knockout documentary pulls most of its punches.</Review>
            <Review>While a good introduction to Pacquiao's accomplishments, the movie as a whole is too shallow.</Review>
            <Review>It's nothing groundbreaking as a sports doc, but Pacquiao's warm personality and amazing story make it a pretty great one.</Review>
            <Review>Manny stays entirely on the surface of Pacquiao's life and of a sport that's rife with dirty dealing and chicanery.</Review>
            <Review>An informative, if largely deferent, biographical documentary that tritely explains the ascendancy of Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao.</Review>

            <Review>The sequel is about as far from the original source as you can get while still using the title, The Woman in Black. It is just as far away from being interesting.</Review>
            <Review>Director Tom Harper conveys this theme through dark, moldy-looking mise-en-scene and the uniformly sullen performances he elicits from the cast; you're more likely to find this depressing than scary.</Review>
            <Review>Redundancy is about all it offers, despite an entirely new set of characters and a story set 40 years after the early 20th-century original.</Review>
            <Review>"The Woman in Black 2" might have served as an effective tribute to movies like "Curse of the Cat People." That is, if it hadn't completely squandered all this goodwill in its last third.</Review>
            <Review>The Woman may be back for another fright, but Angel of Death doesn't haunt like it should.</Review>
            <Review>It's a dour, drab, dark movie, enlivened by some moderately effective chills in the first half but ultimately undone by its downbeat aimlessness.</Review>
            <Review>A seriously underwhelming sequel...</Review>
            <Review>Not as gripping as the original -- but it works for what it is.</Review>
            <Review>Offering nothing new in the way of shocks and suspense and relying on tired horror tropes, this is a tiresome slog rather than a chilling sequel. A disappointing follow-up to the far superior original.</Review>
            <Review>Tom Harper does a truly admirable job of using atmosphere and the movie's creepy setting to give audiences a sense of unease, but moves away from the deadly force we were introduced to in 2012, which feels like a bit of a step backwards.</Review>
            <Review>Much of the horror boils down to heavily underscored jump scares that are neither particularly frightening nor, like the movie as a whole, memorable.</Review>
            <Review>Not as strong as the first outing, but it still works as a classy and refined example of how to revisit the "vintage" horror vibe.</Review>

            <Review>Despite a novel pursuit for its troubled protagonist - he's a part-time composer of electronic dance music - the filmmakers, Youssef Delara and Victor Teran, fall back on some familiar beats.</Review>

            <Review>A searing, penetrating look inside schizophrenia is exactly what "Enter the Dangerous Mind" isn't.</Review>
            <Review>A narratively repetitive thriller suffused with movie-psycho clichés.</Review>

            <Review>There's not much praise to find-not in the substance, nor the ambition, nor the writing, nor the cast.</Review>
            <Review>[Enter the Dangerous Mind] lacks the depth and resonance required to keep it from being merely unpleasant.</Review>
            <Review>The best thing to be said about the ludicrously titled Enter The Dangerous Mind is that it doesn't waste a lot of time bsing the audience.</Review>
            <Review>More of a surface examination of brewing instability, missing cinematic precision.</Review>
            <Review>The title of Youssef Delara and Victor Teran's new film pretty much sums up its shallow and exploitative take on mental illness.</Review>
            <Review>Edited, like one of Jim's musical tracks, with a violent percussiveness, Snap builds to the explosive conclusion that its title promises while always treating mental illness with sympathy and sensitivity.</Review>
            <Review>Its dialectic on the possibilities of change and cure, though bleakly resolved, brings method and meaning to all the madness - and while the film is full of jarring distortions and violent moodswings, it never hits a wrong note.</Review>

            <Review>Although it's been dismissed in some quarters as minor Cronenberg-and criticized for "getting Hollywood wrong," or something-it's a sneakily powerful movie.</Review>
            <Review>There are scads of scabrous inside-Hollywood psychodramas, but never a festering pyre on the order of David Cronenberg and Bruce Wagner's Maps to the Stars. What a hyperfocused duo of ghouls!</Review>
            <Review>So here's a mean, nasty little piece of work - and I have a feeling director David Cronenberg would take that as the compliment it's intended to be.</Review>
            <Review>Something of a fascinating misfire, still shot and edited with the precise authority that has defined Cronenberg's recent period, but jumbled in the search for narrative control and originality.</Review>
            <Review>Bitterly comedic but utterly sad.</Review>
            <Review>Really this is more a barrel of fish than of monkeys - mostly a jaded movie-industry satire (in a cameo, Carrie Fisher plays herself), but also, being Cronenberg, a horror film, full of ghost stories and little monsters.</Review>
            <Review>There's a cruel honesty to it all that's engrossing, when it's not grossing.</Review>
            <Review>We watch to see the worst in Maps, it's revealed, and absolutely nothing about it is surprising. (Even the ghosts are predictable.) Also, unforgivable in the inside-Hollywood canon, Wagner can't craft dialogue or be funny to save his life.</Review>

        <StoryLine>In this romantic melodrama, Barbara Stanwyck plays a pregnant young woman who is abandoned by her callous lover. With only a train ticket, the despondent woman heads for home. While aboard the train she meets a wealthy young couple heading home to happily announce their new baby. The wife is particularly excited for she has yet to meet her in-laws. Stanwyck admires the young woman's beautiful wedding ring and the latter generously allows her to try it on. With no warning the train derails and both the young groom and his bride are killed. Stanwyck survives but is rushed to the hospital where she gives birth. Because the ring is still upon her finger, she is mistaken for the dead girl and taken into the bereaved family's posh home. Fortunately, the accident gives the opportunistic young woman the opportunity to conveniently feign amnesia when they ask her too many personal questions. Still the family accepts her as one of their own and she lives happily until her rat of an ex-boyfriend shows up and threatens to blackmail her. Fortunately, by this time, her "brother-in-law" has fallen in love with her and intervenes.</StoryLine>

She has been raised in the tired traditions of her deeply religious family and is ready to expand her independent thought and stand in her logical, free-will. When the opportunity arises for her to separate from her Washington D.C. home and her bible-thumping parents, she takes a scholarship for her sought after medical program at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. Eager to base her beliefs in the proof of science and develop her life decisions on the tangible experience of medicine - where every effect has a root cause and miracles come in the form of prescription slips; she wisps across the country to find her path, her truth. But what she finds supersedes her natural existence - making her mortality vulnerable to the spiritual realm she so comfortably doubted. Michelle stays in a Minneapolis mansion, a family property dating back many generations. She begins to encounter strange and unexplainable occurrences. As she is forced to investigate, what she uncovers is a world of family secrets and unspeakable evils that God himself may not save her from. In whose name will she cry out now?

            <Review>The line between terrifying reality and terrifying fantasy isn't so much blurred as altogether obliterated.</Review>
            <Review>This simple yet shiver-inducing tale, the auspicious feature debut of Australian writer/director Jennifer Kent, makes for one of the better horror movies of recent times.</Review>
            <Review>It presents grief as a demon, questions reality, and creeps out the viewer by making psychopathology seem like something that could happen to anybody.</Review>
            <Review>At its heart, "The Babadook" is a story of mother and son, whose relationship ultimately determines whether they survive the demon - or die trying.</Review>
            <Review>In the running with Boyhood as my favorite movie of 2014 is another work that turns on the challenges of parenting. This one is a tad more insane.</Review>
            <Review>The Babadook is as accessible as any number of less accomplished ghost stories -- and more genuinely unsettling for its portrait of parent and child locked in mutual but potentially conquerable hell.</Review>
            <Review>The proceeding thrills are economically constructed but extremely effective.</Review>
            <Review>Kent is tapping into something far more unnerving than serial killers or the supernatural: the everyday terror of being a parent.</Review>
            <Review>This isn't to say it's only about how disturbing it can be to be a mom; it's also not only about how difficult it can be to be a mom to a child who reminds you each day of your most dire trauma... The film is also about institutions that fail to serve.</Review>
            <Review>Rarely outside of drama do we see the kind of imperfect motherhood shown in The Babadook, which is what makes this Repulsion-like household of horrors so frightening.</Review>

        <Duration>91</Duration>
        <StoryLine>How many people are too many? And who's one too many? Is this even the right question to ask? One thing is certain: 25 years ago there were five billion of us. Today, there are seven. Dwindling resources, mountains of toxic waste, hunger and climate change - the results of overpopulation? In Population Boom, acclaimed director Werner Boote (Plastic Planet) traverses the globe armed with a World Bank umbrella to examine the myths and facts about overpopulation. Like a contemporary Socrates with a wry sense of humor, Boote questions the conventional wisdom. From Kenya's slums to Dhaka in Bangladesh to New York City, China, Japan and elsewhere, Boote speaks with everyone from demographic researchers to environmental activists, and comes to a surprising conclusion. It isn't overpopulation that threatens humanity's existence. Rather, it is the developed world's patterns of over-consumption and constant pursuit of immediate profit that looms over our future. Is overpopulation a myth with the sole purpose of covering up larger and far more important problems, and making the world's population the scapegoat of a far more complex game? 'It is not about how many of us there are, but about how we treat each other,' Boote recognizes. Population Boom starts with this as the basis for a debate, and becomes a cinematic journey with the masses between myth, facts and politics.</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>Some call him a hero. Some call him a villain. He's "John Doe: Vigilante" - an ordinary man who decides to take the law into his own hands. Frustrated with a failing legal system that continues to allow violent criminals to go free, John Doe begins exacting justice the only way he knows how - by killing one criminal at a time.

            <Review>This is supposed to be a thriller, by the way. It's more of a slog, not so much a whodunit as a whydunit-and by the end, it's: Who cares?</Review>
            <Review>The fatal flaw of "John Doe" is its focus on ideas, rather than people. The protagonist's victims are so cartoonishly evil they might as well be twirling their mustaches before being shot in the head.</Review>
            <Review>Great to look at, and with an aftertaste that lingers, what you get out of John Doe: Vigilante will depend solely on the way that you swing with this thorny issue.</Review>
            <Review>John Doe: Vigilante starts in promising fashion then fizzles. Dolen and writer Stephen M. Coates give Doe a narrow focus: his targets are obvious malefactors, all male, ranging from paedophiles to sadists.</Review>
            <Review>Although a bit muddle headed about what tone to adopt and confused about its moral stances, John Doe provides a talking point, if nothing else, about how society should respond to the inefficiencies of a justice system and police effectiveness</Review>

            <Review>Scenes flirt with cliché, yet the writing has spark (one very funny sequence cuts among radically different interpretations of the previous night's revelries), and Tim Naylor's photography is pretty.</Review>
            <Review>In sticking with seven friends and one outsider/interloper, Lowell hews so close to the reunion-film formula he ends up stifling anything new that may otherwise have resulted.</Review>
            <Review>... manages some amusing moments and shows flashes of visual flair along the way, but it treads familiar territory with scenarios that gradually feel more contrived than authentic.</Review>
            <Review>Beside Still Waters grows a bit choppy in the third act, but like the best ensemble films the ensemble itself is enough of a reason to travel these rough narrative waters.</Review>
            <Review>"Still Waters," in the case of this limp "Big Chill" clone, run pretty shallow</Review>
            <Review>Lowell shows great sensitivity in creating that collective mood, and expressing it through a large, diverse ensemble.</Review>
            <Review>an honest film that thinks outside of the box for a story that could have easily been a rehash of something I've seen many time before</Review>

These two races have dominated the landscape of modern mythology, shrouding the evidence that a third was ever created. This third race, born of smokeless fire, was named the jinn. Modern man has all but forgotten this third race ever existed. It is time for him to remember. (c) Freestyle</StoryLine>

            <Review>With its awful acting, terrible dialogue, and laughable special effects, "Jinn" strains for the hapless genius of Ed Wood, but ends up just another bad movie.</Review>
            <Review>Most of the time, this incoherent thriller resembles an overheated trailer for itself: a glaringly rough assembly of ill-staged computer-generated action sequences and portentous moments.</Review>
            <Review>As an attention-grabbing opening installment for what's obviously intended as an ongoing horror franchise, "Jinn" fizzles.</Review>
            <Review>A watchable if rather convoluted effort.</Review>
            <Review>"Jinn" is certainly not lacking in audacity, but its uneasy balance between inspired delirium and mundane genre dues-paying is its one bridge too far.</Review>
            <Review>A horror franchise isn't born.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director Ajmal Zaheer Ahmad serves up glossy visuals on the back of a limited budget. However, Jinn often feels like it's a showreel for his visual talents. An admittedly uneven one at that.</Review>
            <Review>Some of Bob Kurtzman's third act make-up effects are a small silver lining, but unfortunately Jinn is a pretty laughable affair.</Review>
            <Review>A deeply dopey, distinctly not-terrifying, unintentionally hilarious supernatural thriller.</Review>
            <Review>Clunky, missing engaging elements of franchise filmmaking that would make the viewer beg for a continuation. What's here is a cluttered snooze that limps to a conclusion.</Review>

        <Duration>93</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Shining a light on addiction and the white middle class drug scene, this film centers on a forlorn teenager abandoned in New York City who mistakes the welcoming embrace of a Lower East Side drug dealer for the love of family. The plot follows the sales and distribution of narcotics through teen social circles until they come to a violent end. Benson's fearlessly honest insider view busts the myth of casual drug use as his character, Gene, morphs from troubled child to novice dealer to accidental addict. The ending is a jolt audiences won't forget.</StoryLine>

            <Review>The movie has to be taken at face value: As a wacky and unsettling jaunt into sheer madness.</Review>
            <Review>Casting Ryan Reynolds as a small-town geek who has trouble getting a date may seem as pointless as taking a loving cup to a Leafs game, but the bright-eyed Canadian star makes this dark, dark comedy twinkle with offbeat appeal.</Review>
            <Review>A deeply warped, darkly funny and thoroughly depraved horror comedy. Ryan Reynolds gives one of his best performances.</Review>
            <Review>It's the most likable Ryan Reynolds has been in a film in, well, forever, basically. He's not necessarily good, mind you.</Review>
            <Review>The film is mostly a mess, albeit an occasionally endearing one.</Review>
            <Review>Visually, the film's amazing, blending the everyday with more fantastical elements in a small-town, blue collar version of the fairy tale Iranian landscape in Chicken with Plums.</Review>
            <Review>Those that are on-board with its distressing comedy will find both an acute exploration of mental illness and the makings of a cult classic.</Review>
            <Review>On paper, it all might sound rather sad and grubby, but it is actually a rather elegant little macabre tragedy.</Review>
            <Review>While it may not necessarily be a film that will be universally embraced by genre fans, The Voices is a triumphant example of independent filmmaking at its very best and is undoubtedly one of the best roles Reynolds' has tackled to date.</Review>
            <Review>Rarely do movies shout so loud yet communicate so little.</Review>
            <Review>Reynolds is fantastic as the deeply confused protagonist, while Arterton and Kendrick do some very subtle work in the margins. Don't read anything more. Just see it.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Pomme and Pierre have been together a long time. Passion and spontaneity have given way to predictability and cold shoulders. But there's a lingering optimism, a hope they can return to the couple they used to be, attending chic art openings and sharing a laugh like young lovers. On a hike together one afternoon, Pomme declares her independence by deciding to stay in the woods rather than return to an underwhelming life with Pierre. Pierre tries to get back to normal, despite his worry over her whereabouts and the indelible sense that he's missing his better half. Meanwhile, Pomme begins an extended meditation in the forest on where her own life should go next, with or without Pierre. In the end, both are left to contemplate the strength and meaning of each other's commitment. (C) Film Movement</StoryLine>

            <Review>Devos and Amalric, who worked tougher in Arnaud Desplechin's "Kings and Queen," win at least half the storytelling battle by seeming as though they actually have been sharing the same space, and the same life, for years and years.</Review>
            <Review>"If You Don't, I Will" is a dour, acutely observed comedy about marital boredom that doesn't glamorize or overdramatize the characters' angst.</Review>
            <Review>The loose confidence on display throughout much of If You Don't, I Will helps make the material, however frequently (and often enervatingly) mined, seem fresh. Although dour, Fillières's movie is free of cynicism and bad faith, and buoyed by sly wit.</Review>
            <Review>It's a magnificently acrid showcase for two idiosyncratic actors who seem uncannily in tune with each other, even as their characters are out of sync.</Review>
            <Review>[If You Don't, I Will is] a disappointing, too-lean portrait of a marriage.</Review>
            <Review>The actors play off one another beautifully, but the film bottoms out just as it's getting warmed up.</Review>
            <Review>A playful yet ultimately profound feature, that is uncomfortably relatable at times.</Review>

            <Review>The documentary offers a compelling overview of the case, but Bar-Lev spends too much time painting Paterno as a victim and scapegoat. That advocacy doesn't sit well.</Review>
            <Review>Less an investigation into or comprehensive summary of the Penn State sex-abuse scandal than a look at the feelings it elicited, Amir Bar-Lev's Happy Valley is more concerned with the phenomenon of team spirit than any single question of fact.</Review>
            <Review>Bar-Lev's cameras prowl the streets of State College, Penn. to not only expose the details of the crimes, but uncover a hero-worshiping, sometimes ferociously self-justifying, culture.</Review>
            <Review>... manages to craft a mostly even-handed examination of hero worship, football fanaticism and the power of conviction in the court of public opinion.</Review>
            <Review>Happy Valley ... is less interested in assigning blame than using the scandal as a template to explore mob mentality and the perils of idol worship.</Review>
            <Review>It's an essential documenting of where we are, and it leaves you with a lot of necessary, troubling feelings.</Review>
            <Review>Bar-Lev lets his subjects off easy, but that's partly because they do so much damage to themselves.</Review>
            <Review>Though fascinating, the movie's more of a well-organized mess than a thorough examination.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>This seemingly generic thriller has plenty of twists in store, but perhaps none as surprising and impressive as its ability to manipulate the viewer - first to side with the villains, then to question one's own core beliefs.</Review>
            <Review>Though hardly immune to cliché ... this squirmy tale of dueling addictions gets points for skillful spikes of humor.</Review>
            <Review>For those of you who like it, have at it. Count me out.</Review>
            <Review>Amateurishly realized sensationalism trumps character-driven drama throughout Killers, so Nomura and Bayu become generically morbid sociopaths with way too much time, and blood, on their hands.</Review>
            <Review>"Killers" has plenty to offer genre fans - provided they don't bolt during its opening scene of a tied-up woman being beaten to death with a mallet ...</Review>
            <Review>The characters' online connection allows the filmmakers, who here move away from the slasher genre to something approaching psychological horror, to explore violence as a mindset.</Review>
            <Review>The Mo Brothers along with Takuji Ushiyama have created this powerfully violent thriller that is unpredictable, sharp, and horrifying. Killers is bloodthirsty revenge cinema at its utmost finest.</Review>
            <Review>...an exciting, if gruesome, thriller. It is definitely not for everyone but those it does aim at hits a bull's-eye.</Review>
            <Review>Killers is born from the nightmares of evening news stories and the YouTube-obsessed generation we live in, dissecting the psyche of a murderer from a multitude of revealing angles.</Review>
            <Review>...the film goes on too longer than it can sustain itself. Still Stamboel and Tjahjanto have a flair for visuals and a great ear for music.</Review>
            <Review>This is intense, finely crafted and self-probing horror at its very finest, exposing the male psyche to the harshest of lights - and packaging it all on film for our highly questionable entertainment.</Review>
            <Review>Those who stick with it ... will find much to enjoy: one tense, lengthy sequence does an exceptional job of wrong-footing the audience, while the conclusion is satisfyingly well-constructed.</Review>

            <Review>The underside of the American Dream is on display in A Most Violent Year, a drama about an immigrant trying to make his way to the top.</Review>
            <Review>Chandor follows the psychologically penetrating tradition of Sidney Lumet, Alan Pakula and Francis Ford Coppola, observing crime as a microcosm of society.</Review>
            <Review>Like that camel-hair coat Abel wears, A Most Violent Year is classy and commands respect, but a stronger pulse under the lapels would make us care much more.</Review>
            <Review>[A] tight anti-thriller, one where the violence of the title is more implied than seen.</Review>
            <Review>"A Most Violent Year" is a far more interesting film than its title implies. And a film you've never seen before.</Review>
            <Review>Abel is a man with ideals in a world that has no use for them: If he's going to succeed, he's going to have to use his wits instead of bullets.</Review>
            <Review>It's a taut little thriller about honour and respect, with not that much violence, actually, set in an unrecognizable New York.</Review>
            <Review>Instead of directing a movie that screams "HEY, IT'S THE '80S," he made one that looks, sounds, and feels like a refugee from that era, and lets the audience do the rest.</Review>
            <Review>Though possibly lacking a little bang bang for your buck, A Most Violent Year represents an absorbing, thoughtful and successful attempt to subvert the usual grisly gangster-chic stereotypes.</Review>
            <Review>The piece works best as an audio-video experience, uniquely tying together its period piece trappings with a wonderful soundtrack.</Review>
            <Review>While the title may suggest violence and mayhem, this film is actually a character drama and a stylish one at that. It is a restrained story that meticulously unpacks its characters and shows rather than tells.</Review>
            <Review>While it may not fully reach the heights of its potential, A Most Violent Year is still quite entertaining, and due to the level of artistic craft on display, it's always a pleasure to watch.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>90</Duration>
        <StoryLine>MONK WITH A CAMERA chronicles the life and spiritual quest of Nicholas (Nicky) Vreeland, who for the past twenty-eight years has been a Tibetan Buddhist monk. The son of a United States Ambassador, grandson of legendary Vogue editor Diana Vreeland, and a photographer by trade, Nicky left his privileged life behind to follow his true calling. He moved to India, cutting his ties with society, photography, and his pleasure-filled world, to live in a monastery with no running water or electricity. There he would spend the next 14 years studying to become a monk. Then in one of life's beautiful twists, Nicky went back to the worldly pursuit of photography in order to help his fellow monks rebuild their monastery, one of the most important of the Tibetan Buddhist tradition. His journey from being a photographer to becoming a monk and, most recently, to being appointed as the abbot of the monastery he helped to rebuild, are the core of the story.(C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>[Not] just the biography of a remarkable man, but a revealing meditation on the relationship between spirituality and art.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately the documentary falls short of explaining why Vreeland not only made his choice but maintained it.</Review>
            <Review>An engrossing documentary about a privileged young American who leaves fashion photography to become a Buddhist monk in India, then returns to photography to provide some crucial help to his monastery.</Review>
            <Review>This superficial movie plays like a fashion shoot with robes.</Review>
            <Review>Buried beneath the admiring encomia and ritual spectacle that clog the pores of this maddeningly tactful film is a tantalizing glimpse into the personal and institutional mechanics of Tibetan Buddhism.</Review>
            <Review>Like a good photograph, or a wise abbot, it only presents the evidence and allows us to arrive at truth.</Review>
            <Review>For a film so focused on the spiritual life, Camera is surprisingly lively.</Review>
            <Review>Monk With a Camera has a placid air about it, an air of acceptance, perhaps. That it embodies a certain Buddhist calm is appropriate, although it doesn't make for the most exciting movie-watching experience.</Review>
            <Review>Monk With a Camera suggests that this conflict can be more expansive, that art and communication, ego and compassion might shape all kinds of lives.</Review>
            <Review>The life and work of a Western abbot in a Tibetan monastery in India who serves as a bridge-builder.</Review>
            <Review>Enthralling and uplifting documentary about a man of the world turned monk, but one who effects real, inspiring change.</Review>
            <Review>Too frequently, Monk With A Camera feels like a character study with no interest in studying its character.</Review>

            <Review>The film is an achievement. Its complex reckoning of moral decency deserves a bigger audience.</Review>
            <Review>Gray's movie is an almost flawlessly articulated example of the kind of thing we like to say they just don't make any more: serious, adult, character-driven and impassioned.</Review>
            <Review>At times, Khondji's golden portraiture can make the characters seem encased in amber. But there's a tremendous payoff for the patient.</Review>
            <Review>An astonishingly beautiful, irresistibly grim movie ...</Review>
            <Review>This is Gray's most mature work, and the picture raises Cotillard to a select pantheon.</Review>
            <Review>a slow, simmering film with intense characters and a drama that demands patience and rewards with a rich drama about the American experience.</Review>
            <Review>The Immigrant functions quite impressively as a character piece (or pieces, as the film is as much about Bruno as Ewa), a condemnation of the subjugation of foreigners and as a uniquely beautiful period piece.</Review>
            <Review>One of the wonders of the film is how Gray reveals unexpected depths and dimensions of these characters throughout their journeys.</Review>
            <Review>The Immigrant's handsome Blu-Ray transfer should be welcomed with open arms, even if there's little meat on the bone here for fans of special features.</Review>
            <Review>For what it is - a golden-toned melodrama about an innocent being tarnished and then redeemed in the Big City - The Immigrant is a lovely piece of work.</Review>
            <Review>Unsurprisingly, Marion Cotillard is key as the recipient of the film's many misfortunes, displaying both tenacity and fragility to cultivate audience investment in Ewa's choices.</Review>

But that wasn't always the case. MAD AS HELL documents the tumultuous, at times hilarious and altogether astonishing trajectory of Cenk Uygur, The Young Turks' main host and founder, as he traverses from unknown Public Access TV host to internet sensation by way of YouTube. When he ventures into national television by landing the 6 PM timeslot on MSNBC, Cenk's uncensored brand of journalism is compromised as he becomes a thorn in the side of traditional news media; his unwavering dedication to speaking the truth puts him at the very nexus of the battle between new and old media.

            <Review>Being innocent of much television and online content, this reviewer had never heard of Uygur or TYT but found the film's account of them engaging enough to leave him intrigued and impressed with both.</Review>
            <Review>It's a job requirement for a show host like Mr. Uygur to project his personality and beliefs; this filmmaker doesn't muster a healthy skepticism to match.</Review>
            <Review>Unexpectedly, the film best serves as a cautionary anecdote that epitomizes the mutual apprehension between Internet-age start-ups and establishment media.</Review>
            <Review>Everything about YouTube political pundit Cenk Uygur is big: his opinions, his hand gestures, his eye rolls and, of course, his ego.</Review>
            <Review>A documentary with a paralyzingly narrow focus, and one whose bigger question - What is happening to the news as we know it in this age of fractured and freewheeling media?- is shunned in favor of a simpler one: Doesn't Cenk Uygur seem like a great guy?</Review>
            <Review>If Napier hadn't shown up with a camera, Uygur would likely have continued filming himself, because his "firebrand" commentary is only ostensibly about politics; it's mostly about projecting the world onto his own ego and making it Cenk Uygur-shaped.</Review>
            <Review>There's little to see here that explains [...] why people not already fans of Uygur's would want to watch an entire film about him.</Review>
            <Review>There's a promotional bent to Mad As Hell that whiffs more of branding than rigorous documentary filmmaking.</Review>
            <Review>Interesting recounting of the Cenk Uygur story that's sorely in need of voices from outside his inner circle, people who might think he's just a professional contrarian and opportunist.</Review>
            <Review>The doc is too enamored with Cenk Uygur and his convictions that it hews more closely to being a conventional and one-sided biographical portrait.</Review>

            <Review>Though the film's European scenes carry too little dramatic weight and might be confusing for those unfamiliar with the novel, the Morocco-set opening 40 minutes are beautifully and quietly observed.</Review>
            <Review>Young Moroccan scribe Abdellah Taia moves into the director's seat with the screen version of his autobiographical novel Salvation Army, losing much of the texture in translation from pen to camera.</Review>
            <Review>A tale that serves to subvert the romanticized version of gay life in Morocco found in Paul Bowles or William S. Burroughs.</Review>
            <Review>Challenging, and in a legitimate way, not through any buzzy faux-controversial provocation</Review>
            <Review>It's a quiet thud of a film, which embraces, with grace and precision, the nastiness of growing up with desire stuck in one's throat like a muffled scream.</Review>
            <Review>Beautifully observed and melancholic</Review>

        <Duration>90</Duration>
        <StoryLine>PRESERVATION follows brothers Sean (Pablo Schreiber), a recently returned veteran, and Mike (Aaron Staton), a hedge fund manager, who head out of town to hunt in a closed nature preserve with Mike's wife, Wit (Wrenn Schmidt) - a brainy anesthesiologist - in tow. With Sean unhinged from his stint in the military, and Mike distracted by career ambition, this was not the romantic getaway Wit was hoping for. But soon the trio is threatened by an unseen menace, and the hunters become the hunted. A camping trip in the woods turns into a contest for survival. When the brothers are stalked and ensnared, Wit must unleash her own animal instincts or else end up a trophy. (C) The Orchard</StoryLine>

            <Review>Its pretensions about humans-becoming-animals aside, "Preservation" is still pretty fun, if paradoxically more so before the blood sport begins.</Review>
            <Review>Survival horror is a tough enough genre to pull off; defining the characters within one through tired clichés and boring archetypes only makes it more so.</Review>
            <Review>Like his ill-fated hunting party, Mr. Denham's plans for his thriller don't turn out quite the way he'd hoped.</Review>
            <Review>Christopher Denham's suspenseful survival drama is an ingenious variation on 'The Most Dangerous Game.'</Review>
            <Review>A violent yet agreeably goofy throwback to the survival-in-the-woods genre, with shades of Southern Comfort, Deliverance, and even The Blair Witch Project.</Review>
            <Review>Preservation finds itself fracturing into two halves. Both are moderately effective yet their contrast hinders us from staying invested without being jolted by their artifice.</Review>
            <Review>Preservation ultimately falls prey to a screenplay that grows more and more idiotic as time progresses.</Review>
            <Review>If you've seen the Spanish 'King of the Hill,' the denouement will come as no surprise. Still, the basic situation is so primal, what young filmmaker wouldn't want to attempt a knockoff?</Review>
            <Review>Fans of backwoods horror won't be disappointed by Preservation, but more mainstream audiences are likely to be a hard sell.</Review>
            <Review>Preservation is a great survival action movie, and I'd love to see Wrenn Schmidt become the new badass heroine.</Review>
            <Review>Denham's film has the anxieties of post-9/11 America firmly in it sights, asking what kind of example the nation's recent history of violent adventurism abroad has set for the next generation of boys with toys.</Review>
            <Review>Solemnity is the cardinal quality so you can only hold your forehead in your hand with chagrin. While it is somewhat thrilling, it never becomes truly engaging.</Review>

            <Review>[A] noxious piece of crud.</Review>
            <Review>Questions start arising immediately: Is it satire? Is it black comedy? What is this?</Review>
            <Review>If Katherine Heigl thought the unappetizing dark comedy "Home Sweet Hell" might somehow help her flagging film career, she was greatly mistaken.</Review>
            <Review>While the oafish men come off poorly, the treatment of women as nothing more than schemers and monstrous Martha Stewart clones seems woefully past its expiration date.</Review>
            <Review>It's high time Katherine Heigl sent up her image as a controlling bitch in heels; too bad her dark comic turn takes place in an otherwise dreadful, misogynistic slog of a film.</Review>
            <Review>Wilson is an engaging actor, but he's stuck treading water in a movie with little action. Heigl, on the other hand, seems bored and aloof. She's playing against type, but she's stiff and doesn't make a fun villain here.</Review>
            <Review>In the end, Home Sweet Hell is neither an adequate black comedy nor a good slasher film. It's just hellish. There's nothing sweet about it.</Review>
            <Review>Insipid black comedy about suburban materialism and murder.</Review>
            <Review>[Home Sweet Hell is] nothing more or less than a toothless satire of suburban conformity that might have felt a little more dangerous six decades ago.</Review>
            <Review>... best viewed in the comfort of your own home on late night cable.</Review>
            <Review>Home Sweet Hell doesn't deserve a hearty recommendation, but watching Heigl almost makes the movie worth watching on her own.</Review>
            <Review>Home Sweet Hell musters too little wit and too few laughs to sustain this humorous autopsy of suburban life.</Review>

            <Review>With its stylish lines and creamy production values, "Human Capital" combines the luxurious look of a classic wish-fulfillment fantasy with a stinging critique of capitalism's excesses and psychic costs.</Review>

            <Review>Human Capital transplants the action from Connecticut to a wealthy suburb of Milan, but the theme remains the same: In our rush to attain supposed happiness through money and power, we often overlook the things that really matter and make us truly happy.</Review>
            <Review>Riveting in an insidious way, this Italian drama continues the long-standing European filmmaking tradition of excoriating the bourgeoisie.</Review>

        <StoryLine>What's it like to try to get to know a flying dinosaur? Sundance-and-Emmy-Award-winning filmmaker Judy Irving ("The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill") follows a wayward California brown pelican from her "arrest" on the Golden Gate Bridge into care at a wildlife rehabilitation facility, and from there explores pelicans' nesting grounds, Pacific coast migration, and survival challenges. The film is about wildness: how close can we get to a wild animal without taming or harming it? Why do we need wildness in our lives, and how can we protect it?

            <Review>The movie invokes a childlike curiosity with the natural world and communicates sincere admiration for the people who tend to it.</Review>
            <Review>The film is basically 80 minutes of bird-watching, but Irving has a knack for storytelling that makes the time, like those birds, fly away effortlessly.</Review>
            <Review>It's a nature film with a very personal entry point. Two, really. The fate of these birds, which, the film tells us, could live into their 40s, becomes as engrossing as many a human drama.</Review>
            <Review>Whatever you think you know about pelicans, "Pelican Dreams" will surprise you.</Review>
            <Review>It's a nicely photographed study of California's brown pelicans, fascinating birds with a spectacular divebombing method of feeding.</Review>
            <Review>Thankfully devoid of the cutesy anthropomorphizing that afflicts so many Disney nature documentaries, Pelican Dreams will give you a new appreciation for these creatures sometimes referred to as "flying dinosaurs."</Review>
            <Review>Seabirds shine in leisurely-paced, educational documentary.</Review>
            <Review>Irving illuminates the lives of pelicans along the Pacific Coast through her patient observation and lush, loving photography of Gigi and her fellow pelicans' charm, gawkiness, and ongoing conflicts with humans.</Review>
            <Review>With Pelican Dreams, Irving again delivers personal observations about curious creatures in a manner that's part nature doc and part meditative exploration. The result is as mixed as the process.</Review>
            <Review>If you like pelicans -- and what's not to like? -- you'll like this documentary.</Review>
            <Review>Irving is slow and deliberate in showing the birds, and her personal narration makes it clear she finds pelicans just about the most fascinating creatures on earth.</Review>
            <Review>Stunning, informative and captivating. You'll have a much deeper understanding of and passion for pelicans.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 1945</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>80</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Fabric designer Harry Quincey (George Sanders) has the unhappy task of caring for his tiresome unmarried sisters, Lettie (Geraldine Fitzgerald) and Hester (Moyna MacGill). When Harry falls in love with Deborah Brown (Ella Raines), Hester is delighted, but Lettie smolders with jealousy. Upset at Lettie 's opposition, Harry would like nothing better than to do her in. Does he? And what has really happened here? When originally presented on Broadway, Thomas Job's play +Uncle Harry utilized a complex flashback technique in unfolding its story, which was capped by a grimly ironic ending. Stephen Longstreet's screenplay not only takes a more linear approach, but also radically alters the ending to conform with the censorship strictures then in effect. The Strange Affair of Uncle Harry was one of several Universal film noirs of the 1940s produced by longtime Alfred Hitchcock associate Joan Harrison.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Without compelling characters, worthwhile performances, or superficially arresting aesthetic pleasures, the only thing of interest in "Out of the Dark" is its thematic concern with suppressed third-world citizens.</Review>
            <Review>A movie lovely to look at but on-the-nose and crushingly dull, a pair of qualities a ghost yarn can't live on.</Review>
            <Review>The sweat of three writers and the acting chops of Stephen Rea still don't come close to earning "Out of the Dark" a passing grade.</Review>
            <Review>Julia Stiles and Scott Speedman sleepwalk through a thriller that never lets either of their talents materialize.</Review>
            <Review>Unfortunately, there aren't many thrills and the pace is so slow that I fell asleep from tedium waiting for something that resembled a goose bump.</Review>
            <Review>This Colombia-shot supernatural suspenser with American/British leads and a mostly Spanish creative team offers professional polish but no interesting ideas or atmospherics.</Review>
            <Review>Its lack of consistency in keeping audiences on the edge of their seats makes Out of the Dark essentially and disappointingly just another unoriginal supernatural melodrama we've all seen before.</Review>
            <Review>...a cookie-cutter horror effort that squanders its charismatic lead performances and workable setup.</Review>
            <Review>Despite the grim, ghastly ghosts, it's a forgettable film.</Review>
            <Review>Humdrum supernatural melodrama...atmospheric but not at all frightening.</Review>
            <Review>Out of the Dark proves that quality acting and a fresh setting can't revive a DOA yarn.</Review>
            <Review>While not a breakout feature, Out of the Dark should appeal to genre fans looking for fare beyond the usual slasher movies and creature pictures.</Review>

            <Review>The status of actor Nicolas Cage's career has now definitively shifted from its entertainingly eccentric phase into its genuinely befuddling and perhaps sad phase.</Review>
            <Review>A China-set, 12th-century action drama that cuts with the blatancy of a broadsword.</Review>
            <Review>The barnacle-encrusted plot, which pits little Prince Zhao (Bill Su Jiahang), the rightful heir to the emperor's throne, against his murderous older brother, Shing (Andy On), is dumbed down to the studs.</Review>
            <Review>Outcast feels sort of like a Chinese pseudo-historical soap opera that's been crashed by a couple of white dudes, forcing everyone to speak English with vaguely British accents.</Review>
            <Review>The film may be best remembered for costar Nicolas Cage's warrior coif, perhaps his most unflattering movie hairdo yet - and that's saying a lot.</Review>
            <Review>Stunt man Nicholas Powell helms, his directing debut, showing little regard for characters or story.</Review>
            <Review>Frankly, it is bizarre that this Chinese-French Canadian production would be so tone-deaf and insensitive.</Review>
            <Review>For an action movie, Outcast is really boring.</Review>
            <Review>It's so bad even Cage completists will struggle to reach the end. Abysmal.</Review>
            <Review>Outcast at least has the benefit of a crazy, over-the-top Cage performance that gives this horrendous film a few hilarious moments.</Review>
            <Review>In other words, been there, done that. And you'd be wise not to go through it again with Outcast.</Review>
            <Review>The movie's only attribute is that it's so bad it might benefit from a Mystery Science Theater 3000-style drubbing.</Review>

Reunions can be exciting, frustrating, exhilarating, nostalgic, one life given over to practicality while another chases lost dreams. Set against the majestic landscape of the desert, three estranged friends and former band mates "celebrate" turning 30, carrying their hopes, unresolved wounds and intertwined romantic baggage, in this hysterically funny and poignant look at lost loves, forgotten dreams and missed opportunity of three young adults in the final stages of giving up their youth.

            <Review>The film operates under the assumption that the average Joe associates Mormonism more with "Sister Wives" than Mitt Romney, so the film will be an eye-opener only for subscribers to such stereotypes.</Review>
            <Review>The narration promises surprises ("This story may challenge what you think you know about the roles men and women play in Mormon homes"), but the movie might have started by examining its straw-man conception of the audience.</Review>
            <Review>Would you go out of your way to see an infomercial that was more than an hour long? Would you even pay for the privilege? That's what "Meet the Mormons" would have filmgoers do.</Review>
            <Review>Meet the Mormons isn't substantial enough to screen on the first day of LDS 101; the church's most basic tenets - and controversial aspects - are elided completely.</Review>
            <Review>Nothing more than a slick-looking TV ad, where its placement behind the "pay wall" of your local AMC, Regal or Cinemark seems rather silly.</Review>
            <Review>Isn't it silly to demand the film be more than what the filmmakers intended it to be? Did anyone expect the church to hire Michael Moore to direct its film?</Review>
            <Review>There's nothing in the movie about Mormon history, and no discussion of the unique aspects of LDS doctrine about which non-Mormons tend to be the most curious.</Review>
            <Review>Nearly nothing in Blair Treu's kindly public relations film illuminates the practices or beliefs of the church, except for a will to goodness and success, and small, seemingly telling details go unremarked.</Review>
            <Review>Breaks the shocking news that LDS members 'come in all sizes, shapes and colors' and 'love God and believe he has a plan for all of us. Is this news worth $10.50 a ticket?</Review>
            <Review>Slick, relentlessly upbeat propaganda that suffers from too many sins of omission.</Review>

            <Review>A full two decades after "Four Weddings and a Funeral," Hugh Grant still does that stammering, understated, witty and dashing thing as well as anyone in the business.</Review>
            <Review>Another Hugh Grant comedy that follows the dots without much wit ...</Review>
            <Review>Hugh Grant's latest comedy is as comforting and well-worn as a heavy blanket on a freezing day.</Review>
            <Review>The Rewrite wants to be a film about the messiness of life but it only has Hollywood clichés to work with.</Review>
            <Review>By no means watch this if you're looking for a nourishing cinematic experience. But if your idea of a cozy rom-com is an old Hugh Grant one, this has some cine-comfort-food-carbs for you.</Review>
            <Review>Before it was done to death, there was something terribly appealing about Grant's heroes, and many of his romantic comedies -- something "The Rewrite" nicely reminds us of.</Review>
            <Review>The Rewrite tries so hard to be a knowing fish-out-of-water romcom, when it contains neither romance nor comedy. Any sentimentality or sweetness is completely wrung out within the first half an hour.</Review>
            <Review>Hugh Grant's most enjoyable film in some time.</Review>
            <Review>Simple, unforced and immensely winning.</Review>
            <Review>As rewrites go, this one represents a decent improvement.</Review>
            <Review>Hugh Grant ultimately makes the film an endurable experience, but he can't stop it from being a forgettable one.</Review>
            <Review>Will likely prove one of those hidden cable or Netflix gems you'll be glad you stumbled onto during a random night of channel surfing.</Review>

            <Review>A moving tribute to an extraordinary man.</Review>
            <Review>The "action" here is Turing tinkering with his machine. Or simply thinking -- which, as Cumberbatch portrays it, is adventure of the highest order.</Review>
            <Review>We go into a movie knowing that the subject was as genius or a hero, a martyr or titan. We should leave with a more nuanced understanding of who he was, his complexities and flaws.</Review>
            <Review>This film about one of the past century's smartest humans at times treats its own audience like a classroom of remedial learners.</Review>
            <Review>It's a film about drive, about imagination, and how brilliance thrives outside the mainstream. These are common enough themes given uncommon purchase in a film about a man who likely saved millions of lives by never fitting in.</Review>
            <Review>[Cumberbatch's] whose portrayal of the British mathematician and WWII code-smasher is a feat of nuanced intelligence, a portrait of anguish with hints of arid humor. And, yes, arrogance.</Review>
            <Review>Weapons-grade Oscar-bait designed to earn months of plaudits before being promptly forgotten.</Review>
            <Review>The Imitation Game somehow makes manually breaking code thrilling.</Review>
            <Review>Cumberbatch helps elevate what could've been a rote boilerplate biopic into a film with the spark of a live wire.</Review>
            <Review>Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) is front and centre in the new film and he's characteristically brilliant, though anyone hoping for a nuanced portrayal of one of the 20th century's most brilliant minds needs to look elsewhere.</Review>
            <Review>Does The Imitation Game fudge the edges of its hero's biography? Guilty. But there's artistic truth to the maxim uttered at the end of John Ford's The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance: "When the legend becomes fact, print the legend."</Review>
            <Review>It glosses over what exactly made Alan Turing so brilliant, resulting in a monochromatic picture that could have been - should have been - told in bright, striking color.</Review>

            <Review>The animated lemurs make kids laugh in Madagascar, but the real-life ones in Island of Lemurs: Madagascar should enthrall and inspire even the youngest.</Review>
            <Review>The film is an equally fun and sobering look at the lives of these animals, along with the evolving efforts to try and save this distant cousin of humans.</Review>
            <Review>"Island of Lemurs: Madagascar" accomplishes a great deal in its 40-minute running time, entertaining and educating us while delivering a message about preservation that's clear without being heavy-handed.</Review>
            <Review>No matter which variety the film is spotlighting, they have a power to fascinate.</Review>
            <Review>The technology impressively embraces the audience, putting us in the middle of the rain forest, face to face with curious, beady eyes.</Review>
            <Review>Island of Lemurs: Madagascar is only 40 minutes long, so there isn't a ton of depth; the movie is a nice overview, at best. But it's a fun overview for the whole family - one that may inspire you to learn more.</Review>
            <Review>The photography is vibrant, the lemurs adorable, and aside from some mild eco-lecturing, the tone is warm and fuzzy.</Review>
            <Review>All interesting enough stuff set to some amazing images but it does become a little worthy and dull when it comes to celebrating Dr Patricia Wright and her efforts to ensure the survival of the species.</Review>
            <Review>It may share a narrator with March Of The Penguins but this short doc is happily more sturdily scientific.</Review>
            <Review>The gorgeous 3D certainly brings us nose to tail with these heavily anthropomorphised cuties, even if the actual wildlife lesson's a bit thin on the ground, owing to a very reduced running time.</Review>

            <Review>There's neither cinematic majesty to the vistas (and I saw the movie on a very big screen and sat very close to it) nor intimacy to the ground that Strayed treads.</Review>
            <Review>If nothing else, Wild offers a first-rate advertisement for the purifying abilities of the great outdoors.</Review>
            <Review>Witherspoon et al have done justice to Strayed's story.</Review>
            <Review>Wild may sound like a film about redemption, but it's more about learning to live with what you can't control - and accepting what you can control, which is sometimes just as difficult.</Review>
            <Review>What do you do when your heroine is tough but emotionally hurt, bright but glib, grown but immature? Make a film about her that is both painful and uplifting.</Review>
            <Review>Vallée's film is all about Reese, who's in every scene and visibly loses weight as her trek continues. What a wonderful performance.</Review>
            <Review>Reese Witherspoon makes a strong case for the best actress Oscar.</Review>
            <Review>For all of the trouble 'Wild' takes to get into Strayed's head, you'd think they might've drafted filmmakers with a little bit more experience living in a place like that.</Review>
            <Review>Modern hiking is a secular cousin of the pilgrimage; it heals through hardship, loneliness, silence, and beauty. The very fine 'Wild' depicts one woman's inner transformation.</Review>
            <Review>Witherspoon is, dare I say it, foot-perfect in the central role while the exceptional cinematography effortlessly reflects the epic beauty of the American wilderness.</Review>
            <Review>All of this is most intelligently handled by Monsieur Vallée and his screenwriter Nick Hornby in a film that's handsome, entertaining and not short on insight. And Ms. Witherspoon's gutsy performance deserves the attention it's getting.</Review>

            <Review>This film's tagline should be "Come for the stabbing, stay for the gabbing!"</Review>
            <Review>There will be abundant laying waste of unworthy opponents, and the groans you hear will not be his.</Review>
            <Review>Slow-motion knockouts follow, with Mr. Statham as sure-fisted as ever, but the "Expendables" director Simon West can only summon dead air in between.</Review>
            <Review>Sadly, "Wild Card" is no royal flush, no full house, no three of a kind. A bust is I think the term I'm searching for.</Review>
            <Review>No stranger to piloting action films, West allows the yarn to unwind at a perfectly measured pace.</Review>
            <Review>Wild Card has a handful of spectacular fights (choreographed by Cory Yuen), sprinkled throughout long stretches of compulsive gambling and macho brooding.</Review>
            <Review>As Jason Statham action flicks go, this is one of the better ones, but it is still only going to appeal to the fans.</Review>
            <Review>This is a snappily-edited film that finds a surprisingly solid middle-ground between fast action and gangster melodrama.</Review>
            <Review>It was a risk asking Statham to do more than just bash baddies... it kind of pays off.</Review>
            <Review>It ain't anything new, but it's entertaining.</Review>
            <Review>Much of the climactic energy is focused on a series of trumped-up, ultraviolent fight sequences. Most of the narrative depth gets lost in the process.</Review>

            <Review>This is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen.</Review>
            <Review>There are many words to describe Interstellar. Entertainment isn't one of them.</Review>
            <Review>"Interstellar" is a grand undertaking, but in shooting for the stars, it loses its footing. It goes to infinity and beyond, when infinity would have been plenty.</Review>
            <Review>Jessica Chastain deserves Best Supporting Actress consideration for her work. One of the most beautiful films I have ever seen.</Review>
            <Review>After the first hour, with its poignant depiction of humanity's decline, Interstellar always seems to be rebuilding its momentum, offering plenty to think about but little to hold on to.</Review>
            <Review>It's a film I didn't exactly enjoy and can't say I would recommend. And yet as an event, as a singular movie-watching opportunity, it's undoubtedly worthwhile.</Review>
            <Review>Interstellar never feels overly long despite its almost three hour running time. It also packs an emotional wallop, if you let it.</Review>
            <Review>It's his 'White Album,' overlong and overwritten, corny and self-important, and also a great movie. And yes, it can be all of those things at once.</Review>
            <Review>Can we fly a spaceship through a galactic wormhole to Saturn? We haven't even put a man on Mars yet! It's another 342,077,666.43 miles from Mars to Saturn! Fuggeddaboudit!</Review>
            <Review>Perhaps it would have been wiser to trim back on several of the ideas and present a more cohesive, not to mention coherent, story.</Review>
            <Review>Interstellar feels like a collection of arresting moments and ideas that don't quite hang together.</Review>
            <Review>The result is a flawed but highly engaging experience that is as frustrating as it is astonishing.</Review>

        <Duration>96</Duration>
        <StoryLine>A recently discovered cache of hundreds of personal letters, diaries and photos belonging to the Nazi Gestapo chief seems to reveal a thoughtful, loving husband and devoted father to his daughter. The documents first found in the Himmler family house in 1945 were hidden in Tel Aviv for decades and sold to the father of the Israeli documentary filmmaker, Vanessa Lapa. Through readings of Himmler's and his family's most personal writings and rarely seen restored film footage from key German archives, Lapa has fashioned a fascinating case study: a portrait of the man responsible for some of the worst atrocities of the Second World War, who thought of himself in heroic terms.

            <Review>The movie adds little to our historical or emotional understanding of the Holocaust.</Review>
            <Review>The director sometimes ham-handedly embellishes the readings of notes written by Himmler, his wife, his mistress and his daughter with music and sound effects, but the film works best when it is at its most austere.</Review>
            <Review>Lapa leaves it to us to determine how a man could be so unaware of his moral failings, but some perspective from the filmmaker would have been helpful.</Review>
            <Review>A film that doubtless will intrigue a diverse cross-section of academics, historians and history buffs, despite some of Lapa's questionable attempts to enhance the dramatic impact of her narrative.</Review>
            <Review>At its most effective ... "The Decent One" reveals a psychological portrait of a man devoted to his family yet consumed by a soul-blackening and horrifically destructive cause.</Review>
            <Review>Horrific images of beatings and shootings are adorned with isolated sound effects that seem borrowed from a comedy. The effect is repellently trivializing ...</Review>
            <Review>It is sort of like watching Hell's production of A.R. Gurney's Love Letters, because its correspondents have certainly earned damnation.</Review>
            <Review>How could a man so ordinary and even typical have wreaked so much malevolent destruction?</Review>
            <Review>Eerily fascinating.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately, it gives less insight into the actual psychology of an introverted mass murderer and war criminal and his repression of any sense of guilt than one would have hoped for.</Review>
            <Review>Anyone genuinely interested in delving into Himmler's personal life might be better served by the book (produced alongside the film), which is to be published next year.</Review>
            <Review>An unsettlingly banal insight into the mind of the architect the Final Solution.</Review>

Writer/director Adam Green (Hatchet) sets out to make a documentary exploring this tantalizing premise after being contacted by a mysterious man named William Dekker (Ray Wise).

            <Review>Here's hoping Green's next film is just 90 minutes of Ray Wise talking to an imaginary friend.</Review>
            <Review>Digging Up the Marrow is a playfully self-reflexive exercise whose endless in-jokes will best be appreciated by only the most ardent genre aficionados.</Review>
            <Review>Much of Digging Up The Marrow plays like Green's love letter to his fans and to the importance of fandom in genre filmmaking.</Review>
            <Review>More cheerfully spooky than legitimately scary, Marrow is an interesting use of the well-exhausted found footage subgenre.</Review>
            <Review>Loses me in a haze of winks and Adam Green celebrating Adam Green.</Review>
            <Review>Works as a dry comedy, a slow-burn campfire story, and as a clever look at our frustratingly one-sided relationship with the paranormal.</Review>
            <Review>The concept feels strained at feature length as it never establishes consistent tension or generates any meaningful suspension of disbelief.</Review>
            <Review>Digging Up the Marrow is slight fun to be sure, but it is fun.</Review>
            <Review>A meta-variation on Clive Barker's Nightbreed, Digging Up the Marrow tackles all the same questions [...] with considerably less grace and intelligence.</Review>
            <Review>"Digging Up the Marrow" could have been an effective riff on Barker's "Nightbreed," but instead becomes just another found footage horror lark.</Review>
            <Review>Smart, witty and genuinely scary in places, Digging Up The Marrow delivers much more than you'd expect based on its knowingly cheesy premise.</Review>
            <Review>The premise and set-up for the film are awesome, but amidst all the kick ass monsters and mayhem, what Digging Up the Marrow ultimately boils down to is Adam Green: The Movie.</Review>

            <Review>When it comes to navigating how to be both a family-friendly holiday crowdpleaser and a faithful adaptation of a tricky but profound musical, Into the Woods is mostly golden.</Review>
            <Review>A disclaimer: Despite a dizzying and delightful first half, the film ultimately devolves into a very grim fairy tale.</Review>
            <Review>With the exception of Meryl Streep (as the Witch) and James Corden (as the Baker), the cast is bland, and the bombastic orchestrations tend to steamroll the nuances of Sondheim's score.</Review>
            <Review>If you go down to the woods today... you'll find A-listers dressed like 'Game of Thrones' extras belting out showtunes.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is a watchable, tuneful contraption.</Review>
            <Review>Marshall's film captures enough of the emotions that course through this sneaky fairy tale about childish things like love, sex, grief, insecurity, abandonment, and forbearance.</Review>
            <Review>It's not, in any easily describable way at least, a terrible movie. It's just a woefully forgettable one, staged with all the depth and flair of a halfhearted community theater production.</Review>
            <Review>Arguably, it could have been shorter, darker and potentially more rousing. But that might have ruined the fun.</Review>
            <Review>From its lengthy but rapid-fire opening musical number to Jack's soaring "Giants In The Sky," the project glows with talent, top to bottom.</Review>
            <Review>As long as it is sending itself up, it is fine, but once the director takes it too seriously, it starts unwinding. Still, the musical numbers and sheer spectacle and size of the production keep it together.</Review>
            <Review>Unless you religiously know the musical front to back, there probably aren't many glaring omissions to diminish your enjoyment.</Review>
            <Review>That said, it's an enjoyable ride, with Blunt providing warmth and wit and Corden his usual bumbling charm. But it's Streep that lingers after the credits roll, with a portrayal of a cursed woman that has real pathos.</Review>

            <Review>Despite the delicate shadings Hathaway brings to the role, Song One moves inexorably from wan to wearying.</Review>
            <Review>There are no real surprises here, just lives played out quietly and succinctly under the seductive spell of music.</Review>
            <Review>In her feature debut, writer/director Kate Barker-Froyland tends to tiptoe away from the dramatic high notes that audiences often crave and comes up a stanza or two short from a fulfilling resolution.</Review>
            <Review>The film, like the world it's part of, remains just a little too precious, a little too self-involved, a little too insular. Instead of singing out, directly to us, it hums its little tune only to itself.</Review>
            <Review>Starts off as a singularly strong slice-of-life drama before dissipating into thin air.</Review>
            <Review>Anyone with the slightest allergy to emo-tinged millennial attitudinizing should steer clear.</Review>
            <Review>t's the scenes without music that feel false, and Song One has far too many of them.</Review>
            <Review>There's something just too precious about it all.</Review>
            <Review>If you're a Hathaway fan, this will be worth your time; she's in every scene, and builds a convincingly tense relationship with screen mom Mary Steenburgen. But if you're looking for the next Once, well, this isn't it.</Review>
            <Review>Writer/director Kate Barker-Froyland doesn't bother to disguise Song One as something it's not.</Review>
            <Review>"Song One" is an enjoyable watch, but an even better listen, its songs bringing a thoughtful melodic glow to modestly endearing material.</Review>
            <Review>There are only so many scenes of Hathaway tearing up while either a) staring at her brother or b) watching James strum his guitar that one can take.</Review>

            <Review>Untold manpower, pixels, and money culminate in the gangbusters final installment. It can't redeem the useless tedium of the first two, which exist for gargantuan profits and structural necessity.</Review>
            <Review>Well, at least there won't be another one for a while.</Review>
            <Review>It's adequately visionary, it's routinely spectacular, it breathes fire and yet somehow feels room-temperature.</Review>
            <Review>It plays out as if someone chucked a whole bunch of carefully detailed Warhammer figurines into a centrifuge -- goblins, goats, dwarfs, wizards and wolves bouncing off one another in waves of alternating tedium and punishment.</Review>
            <Review>It's a big, bold, schizophrenic pageant that still manages to work on a surprising number of levels -- creative liberties and indulgences be damned.</Review>
            <Review>Mindless CGI spectacle overpowers every aspect of Peter Jackson's concluding Tolkien adaptation; like the other installments of this lumbering trilogy, it's more tech-demo than movie.</Review>
            <Review>Without a single narrative throughline sufficiently weighty to justify the continued involvement of most of the main characters, just about everyone besides Thorin kind of... bops around.</Review>
            <Review>For nearly 2.5 interminable hours, The Battle of the Five Armies throws waves of computer-generated elves and computer-generated dwarves against computer-generated orcs.</Review>
            <Review>It's too long, too dreary, unnecessarily convoluted and while a technical marvel it simply doesn't engage the emotions at all.</Review>
            <Review>Battle of the Five Armies sets out to deliver the killer climax promised by its two prevaricating predecessors, and to some extent succeeds.</Review>
            <Review>That frenetic fun factor helps keeps this trotting along, lessening the deadening effect of some of the characters' over-stretched personal crises.</Review>
            <Review>Jackson has finally given his beloved series an appropriately fiery Viking's funeral, setting it aflame and pushing its decaying corpse out to nowhere in particular.</Review>

            <Review>"Three Night Stand" gives us the kind of unromanticized romance that you rarely find in an escapist rom-com.</Review>
            <Review>"Three Night Stand" is refreshingly unsentimental in a lot of respects, and gimlet-eyed about romantic relationships, rare in the genre, but the film lacks a strong center.</Review>
            <Review>What makes Three Night Stand work is Kiely's willingness to occasionally let things get dark, a welcome change from the constant chirpiness of typical American romantic comedies.</Review>
            <Review>[The set-up] suggests we're going to get a frisky screwball farce, but with more regrets and recriminations than jokes, the outcome is a lot more downbeat and a lot less fun.</Review>
            <Review>Sam Huntington excels as the hapless, puppy-dog kind of guy who, despite the odds, continues to believe in romance and happy-ever-after endings.</Review>
            <Review>Three Night Stand's teeth are a tad sharper than those of the standard rom-com, but it will be remembered for its flaws, if at all.</Review>
            <Review>Kiely's movie isn't about intimacy and emotion, though the three leads do their best to stay on message. It's about clutter and noise and pointless distraction, and nothing good comes of it.</Review>
            <Review>Canadian efforts to replicate the blend of raunch, smarts, and heart of the Judd Apatow comedy factory have mostly missed the mark but this savvy rom-com succeeds where others have failed.</Review>
            <Review>Meandering but consistently amusing.</Review>

        <Duration>79</Duration>
        <StoryLine>In Jacques Tati's charming -- and essentially plotless -- pre-Hulot first feature, Tati is Francois, a contented and happy postman in a small, unhurried French village. Francois is at ease with his job and leisurely performs his duties, peddling away on his rounds upon his beloved bicycle. Things perk up when a traveling carnival arrives in town. One of the attractions at the carnival is a film depicting the United States Postal Service's fast and efficient postal delivery system. The narrator in the film exhorts, "Rapidite, rapidite." Francois takes up the call, and attempts to Americanize his work style. Intriguingly, Tati originally shot this film in two simultaneous processes - a black-and-white one and an experimental color one called 'Thomson-Color' - but was forced to release the black-and-white when he ran into problems printing the color film; he subsequently tinted select sequences, then in the late 1990s his daughter (a film editor) prepared and released a color version of the entire movie. ~ Paul Brenner, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <Duration>54</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Hydraulic fracturing, the horizontal drilling practice known as "fracking," has been a hot-button issue in recent years, but the public has been denied the complete truth about the energy-producing process. Now, a new documentary, BREAKING FREE: THE SHALE ROCK REVOLUTION, lowers the temperature on the heated discussion to present a full and balanced examination of the process and its effects and results. Veteran director Robin Bossert's film, which will be available for digital download on March 17, introduces the subject of hydraulic fracturing in an easy-to-understand way, and is enhanced by stories of the people living in the towns where this shale rock revolution is taking place. The film reveals both the good and the bad, with the goal of informing and educating the public about the benefits of America breaking free from foreign sources to become energy independent in our lifetime. BREAKING FREE, which was an Official Selection at the 2014 Boston Film Festival, is divided into six sections that tell the whole story, including the history of drilling, how hydraulic fracturing works, and its environmental and economic impacts.</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>Julian Michaels (Bruce Willis) has designed the ultimate resort: VICE, where anything goes and the customers can play out their wildest fantasies with artificial inhabitants who look, think and feel like humans. When an artificial (Ambyr Childers) becomes self-aware and escapes, she finds herself caught in the crossfire between Julian's mercenaries and a cop (Thomas Jane) who is hell-bent on shutting down Vice, and stopping the violence once and for all.

            <Review>Bruce Willis plays the CEO of a futuristic resort where perfectly human-looking androids exist to fulfill their clients' deepest, darkest desires - none of which, it can safely be said, involve watching movies as relentlessly mediocre as this one.</Review>
            <Review>"Vice" is "Blade Runner" on the cheap and minus the imagination.</Review>
            <Review>Recombining elements of "Blade Runner," "Strange Days" and "A.I." makes Bruce Willis' "Vice" an intriguing sci-fi thriller, but in the end it doesn't do enough with its ideas.</Review>
            <Review>It's one of those nearly straight-to-VOD pieces that fluctuates between boring and offensive, never rising above either adjective.</Review>
            <Review>Evidencing more bullets than brains, "Vice" - a bit of ephemeral science-fiction twaddle directed by Brian A. Miller - has absolutely nothing to recommend it.</Review>
            <Review>Here's hoping Bruce Willis bought something special with whatever cash he earned from this pointless, brutally ugly rehash of 1973's "Westworld."</Review>
            <Review>The acting ranges from amateurish (Childers) to bored (Willis, smirk barely disguising his lack of interest), the script gets bogged down in lumpy exposition, and the action is unexciting.</Review>
            <Review>Even with Willis - who looks like he was only needed for a day's filming - phoning it in, in every conceivable way, it still manages to be a hell of a lot of fun.</Review>
            <Review>Bruce Willis sleepwalks through this terrible science fiction film that's short on science, but long on mindless gunfire.</Review>
            <Review>It is set in, as Bruce Willis' mogul character describes it, "a utopian paradise where you can have and do anything you want." Unless, that is, you want a decent movie.</Review>
            <Review>Low-rent and wasteful of some intriguing ideas.</Review>
            <Review>Wavers between absurd and predictable while appropriating themes and ideas from a half-dozen better sci-fi flicks.</Review>

        <Duration>99</Duration>
        <StoryLine>After narrowly escaping an ancient burial ground, long forgotten and buried underneath the marshes of Cape Cod, a group of friends emerge from the thick, marshy darkness, tattered and bloody, lucky to be alive. They have already lost two of their friends in the marsh, presumably dead. They stumble upon an empty Cape Cod vacation house alongside the foggy marsh and break in to take shelter. Whatever was in the marsh is still after them and soon after one of them goes for help, the rest of the group learns that the evil in the marsh is not the only thing that wants them dead. Something worse, something more savage, was lying in wait just outside the marsh, in the house. What happens next is unspeakable horror that cannot be unseen. These unlucky travelers spend their St. Patrick's Day trapped between two evils forcing them to fight, die, or go back the way they came.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Chris Rock's Top Five is very funny -- no surprise there -- but it's also unexpectedly romantic.</Review>
            <Review>As a director, Chris Rock makes a fine stand-up comic.</Review>
            <Review>A seriously funny, semi-autobiographical film that might be the most accomplished work Chris Rock has ever done for the big screen.</Review>
            <Review>It doesn't always hit its mark, but even its misses feel personal and unself-conscious - a genuine reflection of Chris Rock, auteur.</Review>
            <Review>Like Rock's best stand-up shows, Top Five mixes the sweet with the salty, the naughty with the remarkably kind. It celebrates the darkly hilarious with the light of whip-smart observations.</Review>
            <Review>For an ostensibly soul-deep movie like this to work, we need more than smirks and scowls.</Review>
            <Review>He finds a cinematic approximation of his act: free-flowing, unpredictable, personal, spiced up with pop cultural references, political shout-outs, and a decidedly hip-hop energy, and above all else, funny as hell.</Review>
            <Review>[Rock's] high notes are higher than ever, his penchant for uproarious comedy intact, but his cinematic voice remains inexplicably lost in the din.</Review>
            <Review>It's a familiar structure that Rock juggles well and fills with sharp, smart, and often hilarious take on the mid-life crisis of an artist caught between public expectations, private ambitions and anxieties, and professional compromises and commitments</Review>
            <Review>I honestly expected the movie to be funnier, but I did laugh out loud multiple times.</Review>
            <Review>[An] overly self-referential comedy shot through with an uncomfortable dose of Serious Themes.</Review>
            <Review>As a stand-up, Rock has always pushed boundaries so it's surprising to find this is such a sweet movie which could have really done with more comedic bite. There are plenty of chuckles, but you'll struggle to find a Top Five belly laugh here.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>Brazilian writer-director Daniel Ribeiro displays an assured sense of tone in this debut feature, sustaining an air of fragile beauty but never once slipping into preciousness.</Review>
            <Review>Ribeiro lacks a sense of dramatic construction, with the narrative stumbling about thoughtlessly, retracing the same ground over and over.</Review>
            <Review>Brazilian gay coming-of-age tale, almost quaint in its old-fashioned sweetness and gentle dramatics.</Review>
            <Review>A warm, smart and thoroughly delightful coming-of-age story.</Review>
            <Review>"Admirable throughout is the balance that Ribeiro strikes between dewy eroticism and the contextualization of sexuality as just a single aspect of one's identity, albeit an essential one."</Review>
            <Review>The Way He Looks almost collapses at several points into a saccharine mess, but Ribeiro manages to keep the dramatic tension alive.</Review>
            <Review>...the execution is heartfelt and the actors charming.</Review>
            <Review>There are a lot of 'coming of age' movies and a lot of romantic comedies, but very few good ones. This is one of those rare good ones. It isn't a great film, but it is certainly a good one.</Review>
            <Review>Anyone with a disability or who has variously challenged people in their lives (which is pretty much all of us), will enjoy the feeling of hope that permeates director/writer Daniel Ribeiro's entry into the gay, coming-of-age genre.</Review>
            <Review>Daniel Ribeiro's slightly corny, proficiently visualized coming-of-age tale floats on the strains of B&amp;S' music as he imagines a triangle between a blind boy, his best female friend and the new boy in school.</Review>
            <Review>Writer Daniel Ribeiro shows a talent in creating a believable YA story that is not conventional in style, content and tone and directs his young cast with a deft hand.</Review>
            <Review>A charming teen drama bursting with a warmth and compassion unexpected in the genre, and with a freshly sweet surprise of young love.</Review>

            <Review>Moore manages this life-affirming touch without being preachy and by simply melding unusual old folktales into a new story filled with visually stunning images sure to captivate children of all ages.</Review>
            <Review>Irish director Tomm Moore's animated beauty Song of the Sea tells the sort of story that makes you crave the flickering of firelight or wish for the warmth of a blanket pulled up to your chin while mom or dad reads a bedtime tale.</Review>
            <Review>Irish animator Tomm Moore follows his celebrated feature debut, The Secret of Kells, with another ravishing fantasy based on Irish folklore.</Review>
            <Review>A film about terrible things that ensue when overprotective love separates a child from her heritage and represses the natural expression of grief.</Review>
            <Review>It's an awfully handsome picture, and its central tale of loss and reconciliation would resonate even without the magical elements.</Review>
            <Review>Song of the Sea pretty much has it all when it comes to animated movies.</Review>
            <Review>Song of the Sea is a magical feast of visual delights, narrative intrigue and nostalgic revisionism that will appeal to the inner child of all ages.</Review>
            <Review>Come for the beautiful Carson Ellis like backdrops, and stay for the clever way it weaves traditional tales into a modern day fable.</Review>
            <Review>Making its case that wistfulness is a magical force, Song of the Sea upholds the great Irish narrative tradition of extracting exquisite uplift from heavy sadness.</Review>
            <Review>The animation is stunningly beautiful throughout, deceptive in its simplicity, but producing moments of genuine wonder, most notably in its clever use of light.</Review>

Through the wreckage, a child emerges who harbors a secret so powerful even she cannot know its truth. The hope of humanity rests on her shoulders. A resistance movement - The Free Legion - has vowed to protect her, convinced she will eventually bring peace. But the child, now a young woman named Ellie (JORDAN MCFADDEN), has fallen into the hands of General Chizum (BATES WILDER), a brutal warmonger bent on unveiling her secret. With humanity in the balance, the Free Legion has dispatched two of their bravest: Abel (STEVEN LUKE), the soldier of few words, and Tom Dixie (GARY GRAHAM), the cynical war vet. Together, and with the help of a makeshift family led by Crispus Hansen (Tony Todd) and Jebediah Strumm (Doug Jones) they endeavor to bring her back. (c)</StoryLine>

        <Duration>79</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Spanish Lake is a bold and uncompromising documentary focused on economic oppression in the suburb of Spanish Lake, Missouri. Operating without a local government, the lack of community leadership has disastrous effects, including a mass exodus of the white population in the late 1990's. The themes of the film parallel America's growing political divide, underlying racism, and rise of anti-government sentiment. Highlighted in the film is a landmark U.S. Supreme Court case from 1971, spearheaded by then HUD Secretary George Romney, which changed the course of public housing for the nation.

            <Review>A not-so-thrilling heist thriller that drones along mechanically between explosions and car crashes with Ewan McGregor, who is making entirely too many movies these days, none of them worth writing home about.</Review>
            <Review>It's all put together with a crisp confidence that suggests its writer-director will swiftly move on to bigger things.</Review>
            <Review>It's a little heavy on incident, and a little light on soul.</Review>
            <Review>"Son of a Gun" is a derivative crime thriller that sputters when it should propel, skims when it should probe.</Review>
            <Review>"Son of a Gun" adds to the mystique that Australian crime films are meaner, nastier and more brutish than their American counterparts. But it changes style roughly every half-hour.</Review>
            <Review>A thoroughly generic action flick in which a gang of thieves without much honor attempt to pull off one last big heist.</Review>
            <Review>Son is a pretty entertaining little shoot 'em up, almost entirely thanks to McGregor. Grizzled but wiry, he has the presence of a coiled spring, ready to launch at any moment.</Review>
            <Review>Even a vampish Vikander can't make the perfectly pleasant JR exciting. In truth he's more son of a nun.</Review>
            <Review>When the focus is firmly on McGregor and Thwaites, the movie crackles; the actors rip into the toxic father-son dynamic between their characters, and their rapport gives the key action sequences a real kick.</Review>
            <Review>Julius Avery wrote and directed with an eye toward a fast pace and grim atmospherics.</Review>
            <Review>It's done extremely well and with a great deal of verve.</Review>
            <Review>A reasonably engaging thriller, Son of a Gun is most notable for reminding us of that Ewan McGregor still possesses that irresistibly dangerous and edgy quality that propelled him to stardom in Shallow Grave and Trainspotting.</Review>

        <Duration>118</Duration>
        <StoryLine>The new-look Annie hints at a progressive take on a well-worn story, but smothers its likable cast under clich�s, cloying cuteness, and a distasteful materialism.</StoryLine>

            <Review>The song selection and its presentation seems out of his control.</Review>
            <Review>Even Sandy the dog looks like he's had enough.</Review>
            <Review>The vigorous display of good feelings and comforting resolutions has an unusually effervescent sincerity, even if the rags-to-riches wish-fulfillment leaps over all the hard knocks.</Review>
            <Review>A teeter-totter between O.K. and Meh.</Review>
            <Review>Did I really just watch Foxx and Wallis do an entire musical number set inside a moving helicopter? I did, and I've never felt more embarrassed for two actors, mostly because Foxx seems embarrassed for himself.</Review>
            <Review>Considering this musical has its roots in Depression-era American, Gluck's contemporary take on the material is eerily lacking in observations about the rich/poor divide in this country.</Review>
            <Review>There's nothing wrong with reworking the score of Annie -- as this film does -- but too often, the movie seems a little embarrassed to be a musical at all, making it seem as if it's having a crisis of confidence.</Review>
            <Review>This seems like a film that doesn't really want to be a musical.</Review>
            <Review>The film makes it to three stars simply for a hilarious scene in which Stacks takes the kids to watch a movie, which is a most brilliant Twilight parody, called MoonQuake Lake.</Review>
            <Review>After its sly opening--meta-jokes about the Annie we expect; a song-and-dance about class divides--the flick mostly gives us a cocky, fully-formed child, broadly shticked-out adults, a musical-ness that seems show-offy, and almost no political savvy.</Review>
            <Review>Annie has a fun, fizzing feel-good factor but, unfortunately, little in the way of lasting resonance.</Review>
            <Review>Despite an authentically enthusiastic performance by Oscar nominee Quvenzhane Wallis, "Annie" sinks and sinks hard with the sounding of more than a few false notes.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>135</Duration>
        <StoryLine>When nine-year-old Rob Cole felt the life force slipping from his mother's hand he could not foresee that this terrifying awareness of impending death was a gift that would lead him from the familiar life of 11th-century London to small villages throughout England and finally to the medical school at Ispahan. Though apprenticed to an itinerant barber surgeon, it is the dazzling surgery of a Jewish physician trained by the legendary Persian physician Avicenna that inspires him to accept his gift and to commit his life to healing by studying at Avicenna's school. Despite the ban on Christian students, Rob goes there, disguising himself as a Jew to gain admission. Gordon has written an adventurous and inspiring tale of a quest for medical knowledge pursued in a violent world full of superstition and prejudice.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Frantic and silly.</Review>
            <Review>These penguins really are cute, the animation is consistently appealing, and the movie is obviously bound for megamoolah at the box office.</Review>
            <Review>Thanksgiving is a time for family and for shirking work, and out of respect for both traditions-and in recognition that I am surely not in the movie's demographic sweet spot-I'm handing the heavy lifting over to my kids, Tom (11) and Alexandra (9).</Review>
            <Review>"Penguins of Madagascar" is a passible, inoffensive addition to DreamWorks Animation's canon, even if there's a faint whiff of a North Wind spin-off sullying the contained story.</Review>
            <Review>Directors Eric Darnell and Simon J. Smith keep up a headlong pace -- if one joke or sight gag misfires, there'll be another one soon.</Review>
            <Review>Leaving the cute to the bigger kids on the block, with this movie, Dreamworks is opting for pure crazy. And sure enough, the strategy, this time anyway, has paid off in the most unnatural dividend imaginable: darned if these penguins don't fly.</Review>
            <Review>This movie can babysit your kids! And as the reviewer often recommends in regards to movies such as this, a good adult nap in a cineplex is an awesome thing.</Review>
            <Review>Thoroughly enjoyable and unreservedly recommended.</Review>
            <Review>Not a bad way to kill a few hours these holidays.</Review>
            <Review>There's nothing of substance here, but there needn't be. It's just pure escapist fun, wittily delivered.</Review>
            <Review>From its icily satirical start to its madcap end, this is more than a snappy, silly spin-off. It takes those cutest widdle critters, then cannon-fires them through a story cannily undercutting the cuteness factor on which so much animal animation relies.</Review>
            <Review>An animated film should entertain kids, while at the same time, appeal to adults. Frequently, adults are left out of the equation. And, sometimes the action is so frenetic, that only anklebiters get anything out of it. Such is the case with POM.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>As a whole, Scott's version of this ancient tale feels oddly toothless -- neither religious or secular viewers will find much substance beyond the basics of the spectacle in play.</Review>
            <Review>'Exodus: Gods and Kings' is spectacular.</Review>
            <Review>This is the first portrayal of God I've ever encountered who looked like he could use a good spanking.</Review>
            <Review>Crowd-wowing CGI spectacle and the inevitable if inconsequential 3-D effects make Exodus look like pure product, without any defining vision.</Review>
            <Review>Exodus: Gods and Kings is as uneven as Ridley Scott's career; at times, it seems to be a journey through the director's greatest strengths and weaknesses. The good news is that his strengths eventually win out ...</Review>
            <Review>It's true that some modern people still believe in the Old Testament God, but that doesn't mean it makes sense to have your Old Testament figures talk and think like modern people.</Review>
            <Review>Exodus is rarely boring, but it lacks gravitas compared to its predecessors.</Review>
            <Review>It's all such damn good fun, that you can forgive some of the horrendously clunky lines.</Review>
            <Review>Ridley Scott's worst movie since Kingdom of Heaven...</Review>
            <Review>The film may spend most of its running time trying to get the Hebrew people out of Egypt, but in dramatic terms, it's just wandering in the wilderness.</Review>
            <Review>Exodus is all over the place. Except on one point: Scott delivers the all-important spectacle. The well-staged, emotionally resonant Red Sea climax may send viewers out on a high - even as they wonder what exactly they got high on.</Review>
            <Review>Ridley Scott's Exodus: Gods and Kings runs for almost 21/2 hours, and that still isn't enough time for it to figure out why it's here or what it wants to say.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 1964</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>120</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Francois Truffaut directed this simple tale of revenge and adultery which features an exceptional musical score by Georges Delerue. The story concerns a love affair between successful literary magazine editor Pierre Lachenay (Jean Desailly) and alluring airline stewardess, Nicole Chomette (Francoise Dorleac). They meet on a flight to Lisbon, where Pierre is scheduled to deliver a lecture. When he returns to Paris, they continue their affair, but find it is difficult to set up their clandestine trysts, so Pierre arranges a lecture trip to Riems, where they can be together. In Riems however, Pierre finds it difficult to keep the affair a secret from his lecture sponsors. Upon his return to Paris, his wife Franca (Nelly Benedetti), suspicious her husband is having an affair, quarrels with Pierre, who leaves her and asks Nicole to marry him. Nicole refuses his proposition and Pierre attempts to reconcile with his wife. But Nelly, with a gun in her bag, is en route to surprise Pierre at his favorite restaurant for a final confrontation. ~ Paul Brenner, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>Francois Truffaut's "The Soft Skin" is being revived at the very moment when it seems uncannily prophetic</Review>
            <Review>François Truffaut's fourth feature, The Soft Skin, has never gotten much respect -- even though many people (myself included) regard it as one of his best.</Review>
            <Review>Truffaut does show that he can make a solidly carpentered film like anybody else.</Review>
            <Review>[A] steely 1964 study in the cruel mechanics of illicit love.</Review>
            <Review>It's a curiously crude and hackneyed drama to come from Mr. Truffaut, but this way of using his actors and working his camera is up to his style.</Review>
            <Review>Not a total success perhaps, but still a striking and sensitive effort.</Review>
            <Review>It's the work of a director operating at the height of his powers, and figuring out where he wanted to take his career after that first flash of inspiration.</Review>
            <Review>Truffaut has directed the film more like a thriller than a melodrama...</Review>
            <Review>One of Truffaut's least successful, most derivative films.</Review>
            <Review>A mesmerizing morality play detailing the machinations of adultery and their deadly consequences.</Review>
            <Review>It's stunningly assured, suspenseful, emotionally truthful and tough.</Review>
            <Review>The influence of Alfred Hitchcock is readily apparent in this darkly comic and wonderfully observed tale of femmes fatales and crimes passionels.</Review>

        <Title>R100</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2015</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>100</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Nao Ohmori (star of Takashi Miike's Ichi the Killer) plays Takafumi Katayama, a mildmannered father who escapes the pressures of daily life by joining a mysterious S&amp;M club, where the so-called Queens visit clients in real-life settings. While at first the rough treatment and humiliation he receives from leather-clad women in caf�s and restaurants is enjoyable, Takafumi soon realizes that he's opened a door that cannot be closed. Unable to end his relationship with the club, he finds himself pursued by a gang of ruthless dominatrices, each with a very unique talent. Takafumi must either find a way to turn the tables, or walk even further down this dark yet sexy path. A massive star in Japan, where he is best known for his zany television comedies, director Hitoshi Matsumoto has bewildered and delighted Midnight Madness audiences twice before, with Big Man Japan and Symbol, each time one-upping himself in terms of both strangeness and imagination. With R100, he returns with a distinctive take on the sex comedy. The title is itself a play on the Japanese movie ratings R-15 and R-18, and represents just how far Matsumoto is willing to go to slap, tickle, and lead his audiences into a world that is unlike anything they have ever experienced!

            <Review>Even if you like bizarre movies, you'll probably like "R100," then hate it, then go back to liking it, then wonder what you're looking at. And then the movie will end.</Review>
            <Review>"R100" suggests that extreme and perverse films allow the everyman to seek thrills in his otherwise-monotonous life.</Review>
            <Review>Matsumoto works overtime to keep this vital once the basic premise has been established, but the cultural subtext is so potent that he really can't go wrong.</Review>
            <Review>A little punishment goes a long way, especially for the rest of us, yet on it drags, torturously, slap, kick, slap, kick.</Review>
            <Review>Matsumoto says he wanted to make a film that transcended the idea of genre, and in that respect, he has succeeded admirably.</Review>
            <Review>You'd expect more yucks from the country that bequeathed tentacle porn.</Review>
            <Review>A cinematic interpretation of Beethoven's "Ode to Joy" filtered through the sexual taboo of Japan, R100 will entertain and perplex.</Review>
            <Review>I think the film veers off too far into such strangeness (could there be a Japanese TV game show spun off from all this?), but connoisseurs of this kind of thing will find the ripeness hard to resist.</Review>
            <Review>Matsumoto stamps his lurid creation as inappropriate for all audiences under the age of 100 - which some will consider sound advice.</Review>
            <Review>R100 is primarily a parade of kink, topped off with explicit allegory for pushing subversive art past prudes.</Review>
            <Review>Heady stuff, indeed, but perfect midnight-date movie fare if you're, uh, in the mood.</Review>
            <Review>When the film works, it isn't because Matsumoto is playing to the cult-movie crowd, but because he's sympathetic to all the Takafumis out there who fade into the background.</Review>

            <Review>Director Erik Skjoldbjærg (Insomnia) makes excellent use of the high-tech, low-glamour world he depicts, and manages an ending that is happy without being farcically so.</Review>
            <Review>Skjoldbjaerg is unable to make us care as much as we should, and gives the film a kind of muddy look that translates directly into the viewer's mood.</Review>
            <Review>"Pioneer" has the necessary parts for a finger-pointing thriller that could boil the blood if handled well. Alas, this story of workers wounded by corrupt oil industrialists and politicians sinks from drawn-out scenes and too few surprises.</Review>
            <Review>Remember this name: Aksel Hennie. If "Pioneer," a mixed bag of a conspiracy thriller, works at all, it largely does so because of him.</Review>
            <Review>A brooding psychological drama where everything that happens is open to multiple interpretations and figuring out who if anyone is on your side gets harder and harder to do.</Review>
            <Review>Mr. Skjoldbjaerg, who also tapped Norwegian history with his bank robbery re-enactment "Nokas," doesn't convey a creeping atmosphere of moral rot so much as an irksome glumness.</Review>
            <Review>Certainly, the diving scenes look authentic and this is a world that needs exploring. But, the thriller angle is less than effective. Some niftier writing and staging could have made this a much scarier affair.</Review>
            <Review>... manages to generate consistent tension even as it gradually loses narrative credibility.</Review>
            <Review>An intense, moody conspiracy thriller set just before Norway's oil boom in the early 1980s.</Review>
            <Review>It attempts to capture the feel of a 1970s-era paranoid conspiracy movie, and it succeeds in tone, even if the plot isn't quite so air-tight.</Review>
            <Review>It's to Pioneer's credit that it is able to take something as clinical-sounding as "decompression sickness" and successfully turn it into a tension-ratcheting plot point.</Review>
            <Review>Pioneer is a conspiracy thriller that mostly illustrates how comparatively tedious real-world corporate conspiracies are.</Review>

            <Review>"The Liberator" shoehorns the epic life of early 19th-century South American revolutionary Simón Bolivar into two hours of intermittently powerful cinema.</Review>
            <Review>Simple enough for audiences who know nothing about Bolívar, poetic enough for those who grew up reading about El Libertador in school books.</Review>
            <Review>Arvelo, a Venezuelan like Bolivar, touches many of the essential bases in Bolivar's story. But, perhaps inevitably, he is only able to achieve little more than mere touches.</Review>
            <Review>As if the film's ostentatious aerial vistas, merely functional scene-writing and score weren't distracting enough, Mr. Sexton's dialogue freezes dead any simulation of the period with tone-deaf lines amid Bolívar's impassioned rhetoric.</Review>
            <Review>How disappointing that a movie about challenging authority should be such a slave to convention.</Review>
            <Review>Édgar Ramírez is electifying as Simón Bolívar, the Venezuelan land owner turned warrior. But even Ramírez cannot liberate this movie from a clichéd script.</Review>
            <Review>A rose-colored portrait of a national hero, "The Liberator" eschews political or emotional complexity in favor of simple-minded cheerleading.</Review>
            <Review>Surely, history was nowhere as simple as The Liberator makes it.</Review>
            <Review>Compelling lead performance saves violent Bolivar biopic.</Review>
            <Review>The lavish war epic comes back to life is this swashbuckling tale of treachery and charisma.</Review>
            <Review>He was an extremely complicated man who lived a life of intrigue too large for one single film, but The Liberator is still a striking introduction to the 19th century revolutionary.</Review>
            <Review>... feels choppy in its historical interpretation and emphasizes the glossier aspects of its story instead of providing sociopolitical context and substance.</Review>

            <Review>"Low Down" nicely evokes a smokey mood of '50s jazz and Hollywood noir and deserves points for its emotional straightforwardness, but its tired story and deliberate pace never really draw you in.</Review>
            <Review>Whiplash is like one of those Buddy Rich solos the kid idolizes: hot, sweaty and in-your-face. Low Down is like the version of Billy Strayhorn's Lush Life played in one of this film's club scenes: somber, moody and cool to the touch.</Review>

            <Review>Well-written, strongly acted, and often very funny ...</Review>
            <Review>If Philip showed a bit of personality beyond being a boor and a bore, he might be worth almost two hours of attention.</Review>
            <Review>Perry's acerbic sense of the literary/academic lifestyle - which, oddly enough, involves less actual writing and teaching than drinking and "thinking" - is both exceptionally funny and deeply sad.</Review>
            <Review>Why would anyone want to spend time with these people? Because they're fools with great gifts, and Perry almost lovingly explores the gulf between the beauty with which they create and the smallness with which they live.</Review>
            <Review>Written and directed by Alex Ross Perry, Listen Up Philip looks like the kind of movie film classes would study in the 1970s.</Review>
            <Review>A clever and entertaining look to the intellectual and pretentious world of Manhattan. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Alex Ross Perry certainly offers a nod to a handful of directors, but has crafted something wholly his own with Listen Up Philip.</Review>
            <Review>With Listen Up Philip [Alex Ross Perry is] certainly speaking a truth, and doing so with a rare, unflinching honesty, even if it's sometimes hard to watch Philip's tragically miserable existence unfold.</Review>
            <Review>Listen Up Philip is an astute, quietly complex and richly absorbing study of creative success, with note-perfect performances from a superb ensemble.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Crescent Bay is not the ideal place to spend one's golden years, especially since the once-idyllic retirement community has been beset by a series of deadly animal attacks from the ominous forest surrounding it. When grizzled war veteran Ambrose McKinley (Nick Damici) is forced into moving there by his yuppie son Will (Ethan Embry), the residents immediately take offense to Ambrose's abrasive personality. But that take-no-prisoners attitude may be just what Ambrose needs to survive as it becomes clear that the attacks are being caused by creatures that are neither animal nor man, and that the tight-knit community of Crescent Bay is hiding something truly sinister in its midst... Following the release of his Here Comes The Devil, as well as his scene-stealing segment "B is For Bigfoot" in the horror anthology The ABCs of Death, Adri�n Garc�a Bogliano cements his status as one of the top horror filmmakers coming out of Spain with LATE PHASES. In a bookend of sorts to his performance in the cult hit Stake Land, Nick Damici commands the screen here, coming on the heels of last year's Sundance vigilante thriller Cold In July and the critically acclaimed cannibal drama, We Are What We Are.(C) Dark Sky Films</StoryLine>

            <Review>Damici gives his memorable protagonist enough life to hold it together more often than it would have otherwise. He's great here. The movie around him, not so much.</Review>
            <Review>A sprightly horror movie about finding new purpose for old bones.</Review>
            <Review>Late Phases fails to deliver either shocks or real drama.</Review>
            <Review>The narrative ends up working in a smaller scope than one might expect given the premise of a beast plaguing a community, but the journey getting to the finish is exhilarating all the same.</Review>
            <Review>Less ambitious but more satisfyingly resolved than Bogliano's last effort, Here Comes the Devil, Late Phases is a reminder of how much monster movies rely on what happens when the monster's not on screen.</Review>
            <Review>Without a doubt, Late Phases is one of the finest lycanthrope films of the last 20 years and a shining example of great independent horror.</Review>
            <Review>Features some great performances, a worthwhile sense of strange humanity, and, ultimately, a handful of truly cool werewolf sequences.</Review>
            <Review>Late Phases is a fun werewolf flick with a sweet, climactic last stand.</Review>
            <Review>[Late Phases is] a sly, rueful rarity that plays its monster-movie tropes straight, but gives them a poignant little twist.</Review>
            <Review>Late Phases transforms from laughably non-frightening horror film to self-serious family drama and back again, all the while remaining ferociously, ravenously boring.</Review>
            <Review>Adrián García Bogliano ends up merely toying with the death-steeped concerns of his characters, and taking the furious and bitter perspective that powers the narrative's ponderous dramatic core for granted.</Review>
            <Review>Late Phases is a tale of hardcore werewolf violence, a tangible father/son relationship, redemption, and a whole lotta heart. It's funny, brash, and exciting, but knows when to pull back and let the emotion sink in.</Review>

        <Title>Life of Riley</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>108</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Adapted from Alan Ayckbourn's play Relatively Speaking, LIFE OF RILEY is the ebullient and highly stylized story of the emotional entanglements among three couples living in the English countryside. When the couples learn that their close mutual friend George is terminally ill, their shared bonds are laid bare and Resnais' exquisitely developed characters begin to grapple with their own mortality and romantic vision of life. The brisk and shrewdly articulate encounters between the characters, played by Sabine Az�ma, Hippolyte Girardot, Caroline Silhol, Michel Vuillermoz, Sandrine Kiberlain and Andr� Dussollier, unfold an intimate real life story that bleeds in and out of the theater piece in which they are all cast. Splendid scenes of the English countryside and gorgeously illustrated settings demarcate the turning points in the plot, and the continuously blurred line between fiction and reality. A joyously unsettling meditation on the elasticity of the boundaries of love and affection, LIFE OF RILEY is an entirely unique, ingeniously structured and poignantly jubilant farewell from one of the greatest directors of all time.

        <Reviews>
            <Review>As in all of Resnais's theatrical adaptations, the performances are warm and naturalistic, countering the artificiality of the stage conventions and illuminating the universal struggle to create personal meaning in lives bound by social convention.</Review>
            <Review>So frothy and chiffonesque it threatens to burst its own cheeks.</Review>
            <Review>What a way to go. If you have to go, and we all do.</Review>
            <Review>Where the director's early work was haunted by the Holocaust, the atomic bomb and the Algerian war, Life of Riley blithely celebrates love, possibility and absurdist surprises.</Review>
            <Review>"Life of Riley" is neither especially profound nor riotously funny.</Review>
            <Review>If this isn't a grand finale (2012's "You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet" felt that way), it's still an affectionate coda for a master.</Review>
            <Review>A funny, energetic, comic-book-influenced film marked by saturated colors, theatrical sets, and middle-aged people acting like the lovelorn leads favored by Eric Rohmer.</Review>
            <Review>While it may be too mannered for mainstream audiences, the film is also a knowing exploration of human interaction</Review>
            <Review>Ayckbourn's quintessentially British tale of death and infidelity in rural Yorkshire translates surprisingly well into Resnais' auteurist form, making for a delightful postmodern experiment in the intertextuality of art.</Review>
            <Review>It's the end of a filmmaking career of over 60 years, perhaps not the last word he would have chosen... but a pleasant variation on a theme in a rich career</Review>
            <Review>While this may not be Resnais' finest work, it's a worthy final offering to mark what has been a truly illustrious career.</Review>
            <Review>I found it unbearably boring and mannered.</Review>

            <Review>It's all dumb, but fun.</Review>
            <Review>The exhibits in this "Night at the Museum" may still come to life nightly. But their latest movie stays stubbornly inert.</Review>
            <Review>Funny, charming kiddie-flick fare.</Review>
            <Review>There are some key elements that make this "Night at the Museum" sequel work better than its predecessor.</Review>
            <Review>Like many a sequel that has exhausted its plot possibilities, Secret of the Tomb looks abroad to add color and culture.</Review>
            <Review>Let the dust finally settle on these museum pieces.</Review>
            <Review>Despite its change of venue, "Secret" covers all the ground trod in the original but loses any sense of wonder.</Review>
            <Review>Secret of the Tomb feels a little lightweight on the story end. Most of the narrative is pretty linear, and it feels even thinner than its 90-minute run time.</Review>
            <Review>The feeling upon the closing credits is one of relief; with the plot nicely tied up, hopefully Shawn Levy gets the hint and finally moves on to try new things with his career.</Review>
            <Review>As if to make amends for the dubious ethics of the previous sequel (why did Ben Stiller get to decide 'his' museum exhibits were more worthy of life than the ones in the Smithsonian?), this supposed series finale has something of a wised-up, elegiac tone.</Review>
            <Review>You may not find many original moments in the corny humor of "Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb." But, you will enjoy time spent with old friends in this third and final film in the series.</Review>
            <Review>If you keep it busy enough, people won't notice how slapdash the plot is.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>92</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Eight years ago Chris and Maureen teamed up and decided to make a film on Chris Strachwitz, whom they have known for over 35 years. THIS AIN'T NO MOUSE MUSIC! follows Strachwitz as he meets old friends and records music across the country. Strachwitz has been recording these tunes since 1960, trying to help grassroot musicians of Blues, Cajun, Hillybilly country, Tex-Mex, and R&amp;B to catalog their music. Bands such as The Rolling Stones have used tunes directly from records that Strachwitz's label "Arhoolie Records" had recorded. Some creators of indigenous music appear in this film, whose tunes are still so sharp and pack more meaning than mainstream music. Bonnie Raitt commented on the film saying, "It's impossible to look at the history of blues, Cajun, and Zydeco music without looking at Chris Strachwitz's role. He's a monumental figure."

            <Review>Teen film genre docu features sex, profanity, violence.</Review>
            <Review>If the revered works of 80s auteur John Hughes...gave teenagers a fresh, honest voice, Beyond Clueless teaches us that the life, loves and psychology of the turn-of-the-century teen were a harder-to-define mix of individualism, alienation and rebellion.</Review>
            <Review>Beyond Clueless may be messy in places but it's also strange, occasionally disorienting and full of flashes of madness. Not unlike adolescence itself.</Review>
            <Review>Claims to celebrate 200 classic American coming-of-age movies from the past 20 years or so, but really amounts to little more than a barrage of clips stitched together.</Review>
            <Review>It's an auspicious debut, a wry but serious and passionate cine-essay ...</Review>
            <Review>The central arguments about the codified rules of high-school interaction lack focus and (most importantly) context, pinballing around with plenty of bell-ringing pizzazz but precious little analytical bite.</Review>
            <Review>Lyne's film feels like one giant movie high school in which every big screen jock, nerd and cheerleader is housed.</Review>
            <Review>The film deep-mines those American high-school tropes, from bullying at the lockers and cold-shouldering in the cafeteria to panicking about the prom, and, of course, sexual awakening.</Review>
            <Review>Charlie Lyne's documentary about modern teen movies is entertaining and insightful, but also scattergun in its approach.</Review>
            <Review>The clip-based format might be a choice made out of necessity, but the results, though occasionally intriguing, are finally unilluminating.</Review>
            <Review>One of the extraordinary things about Beyond Clueless is the reminder of all today's A-list actors who started out as eerily, almost waxily young stars in teen films.</Review>
            <Review>At its best, in its montages of first fumblings or explosions of adolescent rage, Beyond Clueless transcends most of the films that inspired it.</Review>

            <Review>"White Haired Witch" is plagued with a copious cast and an overly complex storyline. Keeping track of everyone is difficult and the screenplay is laughably bad in spots, making it even less palatable.</Review>
            <Review>The performances are stiff and uninspired, the storyline is trite, the awkward special effects stand out like a sore thumb, and everything is just so elongated that a couple of decent action scenes won't save an hour and a half of complete boredom.</Review>
            <Review>With lame action, dull storytelling and a cast that look like they simply don't care, it's sub-par style over non-existent substance as The White Haired Witch of Lunar Kingdom laboriously plods through its 104 minute running-time.</Review>
            <Review>[a] kitsch-fu confection, with its overblown sentimentalism matched only by its tacky day-glo backgrounds... The action choreography, however, is imaginative and excellent.</Review>
            <Review>With an incomprehensible plot and boring fight scenes there's not much to recommend when it comes to The White Haired Witch of Lunar Kingdom.</Review>
            <Review>The themes are dealt with rather hastily, however. The martial arts action also feels a little truncated. But it's the central relationship, the intense, transforming romantic encounter between warrior and witch, that is the least successful element.</Review>

            <Review>A solid lead-up to the finale.</Review>
            <Review>It's an elaborate game of hurry-up-and-wait. And it's the most shameless example yet of splitting the final book in a hugely popular series into two film adaptations.</Review>
            <Review>Might it have been better if they'd squeezed the whole book into one movie? Probably. Nonetheless, Mockingjay Part 1 is a fine entertainment, shot through with moments of surprising emotional impact.</Review>
            <Review>Jennifer Lawrence's charisma and the the sly excellence of her supporting cast keep "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1" aloft.</Review>
            <Review>Mockingjay has more exposition than a TED Talk, more rubble than a decade of The Flintstones, and absolutely no nonmonetary reason to be Part 1 of anything. It isn't storytelling. It's a filibuster.</Review>
            <Review>As an actress, Lawrence has grown beyond this sort of thing, and the entire enterprise, directed by Francis Lawrence, feels like a massive placeholder for the grand finale.</Review>
            <Review>At its best, this half-Mockingjay details a kind of unhealthy propaganda therapy as Katniss and Peeta head toward their inevitable reunion. But it's not really enough to sustain a satisfying two-hour feature.</Review>
            <Review>Considering the 'Hunger Games'' teen demographic, a somber, dark, political drama/grimy-bunker flick would seem guaranteed to adversely affect the holy Hollywood bottom line.</Review>
            <Review>It may be the franchise's third movie, but it plays like its 'Empire Strikes Back.'</Review>
            <Review>It's still highly watchable, mainly because of the cast and the pawn-or-plotter dilemma that thrusts itself into Katniss's anxious existence. But.. it's hard not to feel that the material has been spread out too thin.</Review>
            <Review>Half a story stretched far too thin with a cast that has neither reason nor opportunity to stretch themselves.</Review>
            <Review>Even when it's lacking in atmosphere and texture, Mockingjay still captivates thanks to the momentum it's constantly building.</Review>

            <Review>The Last of Robin Hood feels stilted, a chamber piece for the stage rather than a dynamic piece of cinema.</Review>
            <Review>A film about actors, played by some of the best actors the movies have to offer, The Last of Robin Hood still manages to connect to the rest of us with characters whose flaws, though writ large, are all too human.</Review>
            <Review>No doubt about it. Kevin Kline is meant to play Hollywood legend Errol Flynn. It's just too bad that "The Last of Robin Hood" didn't cover more ground.</Review>
            <Review>The careful handling of the story has the unintended effect of sucking the life ( and practically all the juice ) out of what could have been a more-than-delicious piece of cinema trash.</Review>
            <Review>...an exculpatory fairy tale</Review>
            <Review>Movies shouldn't always judge their protagonists, but a little judging might have helped The Last of Robin Hood.</Review>
            <Review>Clearly, the subject matter makes for a sordid Hollywood tale that's still relevant today. Why, then, is this story related with all the lackadaisical tempo of a Mutual of Omaha commercial?</Review>

            <Review>Why does it feel nearly revelatory to see a film that treats female friendship with respect?</Review>
            <Review>The two stars display a winning chemistry in this amusingly observant study of female friendship.</Review>
            <Review>Meester and Jacobs have an easy, authentic chemistry, but there isn't enough structure or storytelling thrust to sustain interest in the plot: Triumphs, calamities and reunions keep happening, but none contains real dramatic heft.</Review>
            <Review>Fogel refuses to pander by pretending that the girls can fix everything with a hug. Sacrifices must be made.</Review>
            <Review>The charming story about millennial confusion is deftly written by Susanna Fogel (who also directs) and Joni Lefkowitz, and the dialog actually sounds like the way a pair of smart and funny twentysomethings might really talk.</Review>
            <Review>Most of the time, the banter doesn't sound like banter; the movie shares Sasha and Paige's unforced shorthand.</Review>
            <Review>While it's not the most perceptive film exploring the diversity of the lesbian experience, Life Partners has several insightful comic moments that ring true.</Review>
            <Review>With such generic characters and scenarios, it feels like a sitcom pilot, where lessons are learned and, at the end of the day, everyone winds up right back where they started.</Review>
            <Review>Witty, charming and warm with a fine balance between drama and comedy. It's equally wise, funny and tender.</Review>
            <Review>I did laugh a few times. There is some funny stuff in this lightweight comedy, but clearly, I'm not the target audience for this film which is aimed a young women.</Review>
            <Review>Flawed film about friendship has lots of swearing, drinking.</Review>
            <Review>"Life Partners" may be a dispensable sitcom of a movie, but it's charming and cannily made enough to make you hope that both women will granted other opportunities to show what they can do.</Review>

            <Review>For all its problems, The Captive does try to hit the themes that have obsessed Egoyan for three decades: desire, death, memory, and time.</Review>
            <Review>Becomes baroque and ludicrous as the Hitchcockian scenario loses its psychological bearings in a web of trashy plot twists and self-conscious jumps in time.</Review>
            <Review>"The Captive" may appear to bite off a little more than it can chew but it's one of the most satisfyingly baroque thrillers of the year, and thanks to a perfectly judged performance by Ryan Reynolds, it's quietly heartbreaking, too.</Review>
            <Review>The infuriatingly vague and downright strange story banishes the haunting delicacy of mood that Mr. Egoyan has conjured so successfully in the past.</Review>
            <Review>The structural gamesmanship is just a smokescreen, a way to obfuscate the pulp nature of what is, ultimately, little more than a glorified, low-aiming potboiler.</Review>
            <Review>Surely an Oscar-nominated filmmaker like Atom Egoyan ("The Sweet Hereafter") can do better than this nasty and unconvincing thriller.</Review>
            <Review>Aggressively stupid when it's not downright illogical, it is hard to imagine a film less deserving for a competition slot at this year's Cannes than The Captive, a subpar Law &amp; Order episode at best.</Review>
            <Review>An efficient film with good elements but not enough to surprise anybody. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>The Captive revels in its own nastiness and makes for a highly unpleasant watch.</Review>
            <Review>The end result is an effort that falls right in line with Egoyan's passable yet disappointing run of recent films...</Review>
            <Review>In a sea of superhero movies, romantic comedies and horror, The Captive, is a good choice for those looking to go a little beyond simple entertainment. [full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Egoyan trusts his talent to play with mystery, but also relies on the public to gradually put together a puzzle made of family drama and the suspense of a thriller. [full review in Spanish]</Review>

            <Review>Belzberg presents a view of modern challenges in combating genocide that, while not entirely thorough, is a sobering reminder of the difficulty of those efforts.</Review>
            <Review>The movie feels too short at two hours; it offers a worthwhile overview of the subjects but doesn't treat any of them in much depth.</Review>
            <Review>Even at two hours - an eternity for a doc - the movie never feels too long.</Review>
            <Review>Watchers of the Sky takes on a vast subject - genocide over the past century - and manages to be not just coherent but poetically moving.</Review>
            <Review>The sheer amount of information that Belzberg had to organize, and fit into a seamless whole, is awe-inspiring. The pace feels like an unstoppable river, the current of history, the continuum of atrocity that Lemkin and others sensed.</Review>
            <Review>Succeeds in throwing a much-needed light on a man whose hermitlike life remains mysterious, but whose legacy will shine on for the ages.</Review>
            <Review>Moves beyond outrage at singular atrocities. . .to credit Lemkin's prescience in demonstrating difficulty in identifying genocide, to stop it, and meting out punishment.</Review>
            <Review>Anyone possessed with even a fleeting sense of social justice should be amazed and appalled by what he/she sees and learns in Edet Belzberg's Watchers of the Sky.</Review>
            <Review>An extraordinary documentary about a heroic peacemaker who coined the term "genocide" and fought to bring those responsible for mass killings to trial.</Review>
            <Review>It isn't a hopeful story, but it is a story of how committed people have fought and struggled to create the possibility for hope in the future.</Review>
            <Review>Well-researched, potent and equally informative, emotionally devastating and exhausting.</Review>
            <Review>This is, to put it mildly, a lot of information for one documentary, which inevitably devolves to resemble not so much an anthology as a slideshow of genocide's greatest hits.</Review>

            <Review>For the elementary schoolgirls who make up the target audience, "Legend of the Neverbeast" is a welcome visit with their favorite characters, even though Tink herself (Mae Whitman) is reduced to a supporting role.</Review>
            <Review>The titular pixie is a peripheral character in this colorful and cheery new franchise entry.</Review>
            <Review>There's little that feels direct-to-video about this lively, surprisingly cinematic CG adventure.</Review>
            <Review>Full of rich colours, gentle humour and mild spills and thrills, this enchanting tale is sure to delight little girls. Grown-ups could well be charmed, too.</Review>
            <Review>Beautifully produced and relentlessly paced, the films work as wonderful, empowering little fables about friendship, teamwork, community and trust...it's hard to fault Neverbeast as great, value-added entertainment for kids.</Review>
            <Review>Experienced Tinker Bell watchers should be able to predict roughly where the story is headed; still, by the standards of the series the ending is unusually contemplative, even sombre.</Review>
            <Review>A more intense, adventurous, vividly drawn installment in the Tinker Bell series.</Review>
            <Review>This is an endearing entry into the Tinkerbell franchise that succeeds in spite of the reservations and flaws that have hitherto been outlined.</Review>

            <Review>Never judge a book (or a person, or a NeverBeast) by its cover.</Review>

Now enrolled at the exclusive Hamilton preparatory school, her psychosis and hallucinations intensify with the dubious suicides of current and past students as does her first love for Tobey Crawford. The discovery that her new school may be run by a coven of beautiful and seductive women who perpetuate their youth by drinking the blood of virgins becomes the ultimate challenge of Beckett and Tobey's young lives. INNOCENCE is a chilling allegory of the precarious state of an American teenager, explores themes of loss, the human condition and a society torn between purity and narcissism.

            <Review>This is Pacino's best film performance in years. In playing an actor who has lost the art of fooling himself, he reveals with mordant wit the terrors of diminished capacity. To watch him do it is a master class.</Review>
            <Review>"The Humbling" reveals an ominous gulf between the director and his theme ...</Review>
            <Review>Pacino gives a refreshingly quiet and understated performance with poignant moments of vulnerability. It is the most consistent factor in a film that is frustratingly inconsistent.</Review>
            <Review>An unusually charming dark comedy about an actor teetering on the edges of reality, fantasy and career.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is too shrewd to qualify as a jeremiad, but underneath the comedy are boiling undercurrents of anger and despair.</Review>
            <Review>If you liked Birdman, you also might like seeing Al Pacino playing a delusional, indeed hallucinatory, actor trying to save his soul and his onstage career in the sort-of-comedy The Humbling. Or you might not.</Review>
            <Review>In the end, 'The Humbling' is one of those movies where the "plot" is far less interesting than what the movie is "about" - and in this case, it's about acting in general and Al Pacino in particular.</Review>
            <Review>It definitely seems like there is a thin line between method acting and insanity in The Humbling.</Review>
            <Review>A melancholic alternation of bitter and comedic sketches, all resolutely low-key and wildly uneven.</Review>
            <Review>It's a mopey, silly situation, whose only tension comes from our perpetual fear that Levinson is about to make us watch a somber drama copulating with a farce.</Review>
            <Review>This is really two stories: one about an old guy trying to prove he's still got it sexually speaking, and the other about an artist losing a grip on his craft. The latter plot point is decent. The former? Yuck.</Review>
            <Review>A messy movie but also a thrilling one, grappling with diminished talents and vanishing virility in brutally honest ways that show up the similarly-themed Birdman as a cheap parlor trick.</Review>

            <Review>Big Muddy is set in the present, but it doesn't have to be. The prairie-noir premise is pretty timeless.</Review>

            <Review>There's just no life in the film: aiming for a tone of studied foreboding, Bennett Miller instead sucks all the energy from his story.</Review>
            <Review>Director Bennett Miller ("Capote," "Moneyball") has a fascinating story here and he knows it.</Review>
            <Review>Watch this film for the performances: Tatum and Ruffalo finding new ground in familiar personas; Carell immersing himself into the mindset of a troubled man ...</Review>
            <Review>Foxcatcher is too cold of a movie to love, but that chilliness is intentional and transfixing, a parable about the darkest corners of the minds of damaged men that dares to whisper instead of shout.</Review>
            <Review>If you're willing to be thrown for a loop, you're in good hands with this medal-worthy cast and crew.</Review>
            <Review>Foxcatcher is a different beast, just sitting there with nothing to say.</Review>
            <Review>In the back hour, the music quietly turns the screws, and Miller stops letting the air in, and I realized that a knot had formed in my chest.</Review>
            <Review>There is an unspoken emptiness that hangs boldly over Foxcatcher, which is sure to be one of the subtly darkest films made by a major Hollywood studio this year.</Review>
            <Review>In the end, nevertheless, it's the three male leads that bring the human story to the foreground; to me, Channing Tatum's proto-Homo-Sapiens wrestler/caveman is startling to watch.</Review>
            <Review>There are times in this brilliantly acted and understated psychological drama when it seems very little happens at all, but when the lights go up you're left reeling by the culmination of events that have quietly unfolded.</Review>
            <Review>The kind of timeless, rib-sticking drama that moviegoers often lament the loss of, only to ignore when they actually come around. Don't make that mistake here.</Review>

            <Review>It feels more like a poem. Or, at times, a symphony. But it's much less effective as an actual movie.</Review>
            <Review>"God tells truths in parables," someone says - a line that Edwards most likely aspires to take possession of, as if his poetic, pictorial parable had its own truths to tell.</Review>
            <Review>The narrative is gentle and sparse. The beautifully photographed imagery, shot in elegant, deep-focus black-and-white, is exceptional. The music is richly classical.</Review>
            <Review>A gorgeous look at the raw, wooded Indiana of the early 1800s and a dreamy study of the boy Lincoln who was destined to leave it behind.</Review>
            <Review>History, as subject matter, is hard enough to sell as cinema. The Better Angels will not make the struggle any easier.</Review>
            <Review>Had Terrence Malick taken a shot at making a Ken Burns movie, it would probably have turned out better than "The Better Angels," A.J. Edwards's humorless, pretentious black-and-white tone poem about a very young Abe Lincoln.</Review>
            <Review>The Better Angels makes for a sublime, transfixing, and informative look at the early life of Abraham Lincoln.</Review>
            <Review>Visually, Angels is a true work of art. Each and every frame of Matthew J. Lloyd's black-and-white cinematography is suitable for framing.</Review>
            <Review>Kudos to this young director for making quite a good film -- even if the guiding hand of Malick is present in every shot.</Review>
            <Review>A dreamlike reverie as well as a uniquely American origin story...</Review>
            <Review>Lovely and poetic, if entirely too sketchy and Terrence Malick-like for its own good</Review>
            <Review>Contemplative but pretentious drama about Lincoln's boyhood.</Review>

            <Review>There's little going on in the final product other than good intentions, as Jeta Amata always seems overreaching for the right buttons to push.</Review>
            <Review>Hollywood and Nollywood collaborate to underwhelming effect in Jeta Amata's impassioned but inert issue thriller.</Review>
            <Review>At once passionate and cynical, Amata skillfully lays out the ways that Nigeria is screwed.</Review>
            <Review>There's a go-for-broke vigor to the way Mr. Amata cuts to the conflict in most scenes, but the heavy-handedness across the board imposes some significant limitations. Mr. Amata, though, pulls no punches with his ending.</Review>
            <Review>Filled with declamatory speeches, stereotypical characters and heavily telegraphed, melodramatic plot developments, the film fails to work as either thriller or politically themed drama.</Review>
            <Review>Basinger, Rourke, Anne Heche, Vivica A. Fox, Akon and Wyclef Jean all appear lost or disengaged in bit parts that give a B-movie feel to a political passion project.</Review>
            <Review>Nigerian filmmaker Jeta Amata clearly feels passionate about the problems in his country, but despite the presence of Hollywood stars the movie is made in a style that will feel amateurish to Western audiences.</Review>
            <Review>... raises some compelling true-life sociopolitical issues but lacks the subtlety or focus to become suitably provocative.</Review>
            <Review>The film is devoid of subtext, filled with cardboard stand-ins for contrasting viewpoints on the powder keg of social and political issues facing Nigeria.</Review>
            <Review>This is a botched endeavor, despite having pure intentions to rattle the world.</Review>
            <Review>Everything here is either too weird or too preachy to make an impact, unless you're really, really into being lectured to for 95 minutes.</Review>
            <Review>A scattering of Hollywood actors, an important subject -- how Nigeria came to be the failing state it is today and Big Oil's role in it -- but a rather clumsy film.</Review>

        <Duration>103</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Amei Wallach and editor/cinematographer Ken Kobland made the acclaimed portrait LOUISE BOURGEOIS: THE SPIDER, THE MISTRESS AND THE TANGERINE. Here they collaborate with the Hermitage Museum to explore the fascinating lives and work of the Kabakovs, a husband-and-wife team who are Russia's most acclaimed visual artists. Born in 1933 in the Ukraine - to a Jewish family during the famine artificially created by Stalin - Ilya Kabakov's life changed when he literally stumbled into the Leningrad School of Art. The deprivation he and his mother suffered during this period serves as the emotional substrata of his art. In the Soviet Union he led a double life: as a successful state-approved illustrator and as a major artist, forbidden to exhibit his own art. Coming to the US in 1988, Ilya began to build three-dimensional spaces using the communal apartment as a metaphor for the intellectual, psychological and physical repression at the core of Soviet life. In 2005, he became the first living Russian artist to exhibit at the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg. (c) Film Forum</StoryLine>

            <Review>There's a lot of material here to get through, and Wallach and her cinematographer Ken Kobland take their time with it, a gamble of an approach which works, on the whole.</Review>
            <Review>There's little art to Wallach's camerawork or pacing. Still, Ilya and Emilia are fascinating enough to merit sitting through Enter Here's meanderings.</Review>
            <Review>The orchestration wobbles now and again, but Ms. Wallach has fashioned a multifaceted, informative portrait conveying the emotional urgency of the Kabakovs' work.</Review>
            <Review>A look back at the husband-and-wife team whose surreal, mimetic installations reinvented the landscape of Soviet and post-Soviet art.</Review>
            <Review>Wallach and Kobland have made a graceful, enormously moving portrait of a complicated artist and an artistic collaboration.</Review>
            <Review>A warm, human portrait of two brilliant artists undermined by pretentious, distracting editing and cinematography.</Review>
            <Review>Granted terrifically complete access, Wallach's camera captures the Kabakovs, a truly engaging couple, with an invigorating, inviting intimacy.</Review>
            <Review>At times, it's hard to imagine how a real, physical visit to a Kabakov exhibit could improve upon Wallach's film, which plays like the world's trippiest docent.</Review>
            <Review>The research that went into the film seems a largesse, but it's compromised at every turn by filmmaker Amei Wallach's sloppy, pedantic delivery.</Review>

        <StoryLine>When out-of-work-actors Raphael (Ivan Martin) and Dominic (Michael Godere) hustle a prominent New York producer into believing they've written a hot movie script, they have 10 days to deliver the goods or lose their last opportunity for a big break. Hoping to escape the bustle of New York City to write in peace, the duo head to the upstate country home of Dom's sister Gigi (Marisa Tomei). But their writer's retreat descends into bacchanalian romp when Gigi's hostile boyfriend Wayne (Sam Rockwell) and his younger brother Devon (Brian Geraghty) bring old flames and simmering grudges to a head for the group. As yearnings for love and familial dynamics threaten to derail their career-making opportunity, will Raph and Dom's friendship survive the creative process? (C) The Orchard</StoryLine>

            <Review>Simply the latest in a string of pointless low-budget exercises in angsty Big Apple self-reflection.</Review>
            <Review>Yes, we have seen much of it before. But for the majority of the film's brief running time (a flicker or so under 80 minutes), I felt myself drawn to what was on screen.</Review>
            <Review>Ms. Tomei, Mr. Rockwell and Mr. Geraghty get stray laughs, but "Loitering With Intent" mostly plays like an excuse for its makers to hang out.</Review>
            <Review>The title may suggest acts of indecency, but if there's anything this mild dramedy could use, it's a little more raciness.</Review>
            <Review>The sort of well-meaning, small-scale drama about the creative method that feels too obviously plotted and conventionally scripted to achieve any genuine truths regarding the process.</Review>
            <Review>I enjoyed watching them work, even as I knew it wouldn't amount to much.</Review>

            <Review>Barely a cut above the thankfully defunct Mumblecore movement, "Loitering With Intent" does plenty of loitering but doesn't exhibit much commitment.</Review>
            <Review>Periodically funny but always amiable, Intent finds a groove and sticks with the delayed maturation routine, electing to extract the most personality out of its engaged cast.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Sam (Alex Russell) stands on stage as thousands of fans go wild. Smart, charismatic, handsome, he moves them with his message, and when he calls for donations to his charity, the money pours in. Only thing is, Sam doesn't believe a word he's saying. Just months earlier, Sam was a typical college senior focused on keg stands, hookups and graduation. But when a surprise tuition bill threatens his dream of law school and leaves him thousands of dollars in the hole, he's forced to think outside the box. Convincing his three roommates they can make a killing exploiting the gullible church crowd, the guys start a sham charity and begin campaigning across the country, raising funds for a cause as fake as their message. For Sam, embezzling money is easy compared to getting attention from the person he cares about the most. When Callie (Johanna Braddy), the tour manager and Sam's love interest, finally uncovers the guys' ruse, it's Sam's moment of truth. On the final night of the tour, before a packed auditorium but alone in the spotlight, it's time for Sam to decide what he really believes.(c) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>A thought-provoking, faith-based parable asking whether it's ever too late to make a second impression, especially on God.</Review>
            <Review>Believe Me pokes fun at gullible Christians, but it has another, more deserving target in its sights.</Review>
            <Review>A knowing, very sharp script gives this comedy a very strong kick as it tells a story about interlopers in America's Christian subculture.</Review>

            <Review>There are moments when the movie hits the target. Unfortunately, they're not enough to raise what might have been a sharp, perceptive take on the rah-rah side of modern Christianity above the level of mediocrity.</Review>

Academy Award-winning director James Moll traveled across the country to capture a first-hand glimpse into this high-risk/high-reward job, along the way discovering the passion these farmers have for a way of life that has been passed down from generation to generation, yet continues to evolve.

            <Review>Perhaps if Moll offered less of the static sit-down interviews and more fly-on-the-grain vérité, viewers might feel some new, intimate connection between the farmers and the nourishment that unites us.</Review>
            <Review>Though the perspective of farmers is well worth examining, this good-looking 77 minutes of propaganda is heavy on sugar-coating and light on nutritional value.</Review>
            <Review>Some of the human-interest stories are compelling, but too much of this film is as dry as a high school classroom presentation.</Review>
            <Review>"Farmland" often comes off like lobbyist propaganda, profusely extolling the virtues of the independent American farmer.</Review>
            <Review>After a bit of a slow start, Farmland finishes strong as it eventually transforms into a fascinating, emotional narrative with more layers than we might have expected.</Review>
            <Review>Doesn't exercise a great deal of editorial discipline in crafting deep narrative through-lines, but steeped enough in feeling to provide a freshmen-level survey class on modern American agriculture.</Review>
            <Review>The farmers interviewed in "Farmland" seem sincere, but the industry's backing raises some troubling credibility questions.</Review>
            <Review>If the point of Farmland was to recruit people to the farming life, then it is most likely a success...But as anything more than a well-meaning cinematic brochure, it simply doesn't fly.</Review>
            <Review>"Farmland" is essentially just masquerading as an actual documentary. In reality, it's a glossy corporate infomercial for American agribusiness.</Review>

        <StoryLine>2977: For many years a mighty battle has been raging across the galaxies as 500 billion humans, whose forebears were exiled from Earth, plan to return to what is still called home. Forced to flee a ravaged Earth, humans have now depleted the corners of the galaxy to which they fled. Earth has now become the most valued and precious resource of all, controlled by the corrupt Gaia Coalition which governs the human race across the different galaxies. Having been exiled and vilified during the battle of the Homecoming War, Captain Harlock and his trusted crew of the Arcadia battle cruiser are the only hope mankind has of discovering the secrets that the Gaia have kept hidden. The Coalition has demanded Harlock's death and the Gaia Fleet's new leader, Ezra, calls on his younger brother, Logan, to infiltrate the Arcadia and then assassinate Harlock, thus forever eradicating the one man standing between the Coalition and their complete control of the Universe.

            <Review>The campers, of course, hate it, and many seem to suggest it becomes basically another game to them. Figure it out, get released, go back to the computer.</Review>
            <Review>The film is fascinating and often darkly funny, but it's hard not to wish for some actual analysis to flesh out the many scenes of grim people in gray rehab.</Review>
            <Review>The human stories in "Web Junkie" are instantly identifiable, stories of a world where everyone has been brought closer together and simultaneously kept apart.</Review>
            <Review>The kids are as uncommunicative as teenage boys tend to be in every country, and shots of them marching in unison or looking sadly out from behind chain-link fences are only compelling for so long.</Review>
            <Review>The film lacks either the immersive intensity that would galvanize emotions or a context that would provide enlightenment. Its brief tour of an unpleasant corner of reality feels less revelatory than voyeuristic.</Review>
            <Review>The slow (albeit unevenly paced) unveiling of the boys' stories is persuasive and chilling. Internet addiction is real.</Review>
            <Review>A timely and thought-provoking documentary about efforts in China to deprogram teenagers addicted to Internet gaming.</Review>
            <Review>Docu explores Internet addiction and family relationships.</Review>
            <Review>Without a frame of footage nor a single interview presented from outside the camp, the documentary shows a capitalist nightmare that accords its victims zero wiggle room.</Review>
            <Review>A tough love remedy for internet addiction designed for impressionable young minds which prefer virtual reality to relating in the flesh.</Review>
            <Review>Shlam and Medalia haven't constructed the film particularly artfully... but Web Junkie is a case where the access is so unexpected and revelatory that it's a wonder just to have the footage.</Review>

        <Duration>100</Duration>
        <StoryLine>In India, a group of boys dream of becoming Chess Grandmasters. But this is no ordinary chess and these are no ordinary players. Opening at Laemmle's Town Center 5 in Los Angeles on October 17 and at the Quad Cinema in New York City on Oct 24, Algorithms is a documentary that transports us into the little known world of Blind Chess. Chess is an ancient and universal game with origins in India. Filmed over three years in different parts of India, Algorithms follows three boys and an adult champion who not only aspires to bring global recognition to India's blind chess players, but also wants to encourage all blind children to play chess. The filmmakers travel with the players to competitive tournaments, including the World Junior Blind Chess Championship. They also film them in their home milieu where they reveal their struggles, anxieties and hopes. Moving through the algorithms of the blind chess world, the film is a tactile and mindful journey that challenges the notion of what it means to "see."(C) First Run Features</StoryLine>

            <Review>"Algorithms" is a completely unique film, unlike any other documentary you'll see this year, both for its content and its form. But it is also a deeply absorbing, timeless, universal tale with themes anyone can find inspiration in.</Review>
            <Review>An object lesson in how a remarkable subject can be turned into a less remarkable film.</Review>
            <Review>As with many stories about children involved in a competitive activity, "Algorithms" is partly a portrait of grown-up hopes channeled through kids.</Review>
            <Review>Three visually impaired teenage boys from India who play chess at the championship level are the subject of this slow-moving yet soulful documentary.</Review>
            <Review>Shot in black and white, and featuring lots of close-ups of fingers reading the chess pieces like braille, the film echoes the meditative pacing of the game.</Review>
            <Review>Shot - a little obviously - in black and white, Ian McDonald's film is otherwise a winning documentary that develops into a story as intense and focused as his subjects.</Review>
            <Review>...while these disparate parts are compelling on a surface level, Algorithms is unable to cohere into a decent, coherent, and consistently paced whole.</Review>
            <Review>But the result is simply a literal draining of additional color from an already pallid piece of work that does little justice to the incredible struggles of these exceptional young men.</Review>
            <Review>If you've ever played chess, you'll appreciate the dedication that the film's blind protagonist devote to the only sport that sharpens the brain rather than destroys it.</Review>
            <Review>It's rare to see such transcendence in a film. And that's exactly why this should be watched and cherished by every movie buff out there.</Review>
            <Review>The narrative moves seamlessly between the games and competitions to the boys' homes, neighbourhoods and cities. When it comes to the sport itself, the film plants you on the 64 squares.</Review>

            <Review>Melancholy runs deep in "Private Peaceful," a richly appointed British period piece about fraternal loyalty adapted from the book of the same name by "War Horse" author Michael Morpurgo.</Review>
            <Review>A World War I fable that's as stiff as an Eton collar and as plodding as a draft horse.</Review>
            <Review>A long, long, trail a-winding, to be sure. But fans of PBS, history and a certain kind of old-fashioned moviemaking may fall in.</Review>
            <Review>O'Connor captures all the beauty of these rural childhoods without skimping on the harsh realities of 20th-century feudalism.</Review>
            <Review>O'Connor shows his old-school expertise in the charming country childhood sequences, where the film feels most individual and alive.</Review>
            <Review>It's an earnest interpretation of familiar themes.</Review>
            <Review>By modestly embracing its inherent minimalism and finding the emotions underlying even the most schematic of scenarios, the film taps into something unmistakably human.</Review>
            <Review>Trench warfare as the backdrop for a tawdry love triangle about as incestuous as it gets.</Review>
            <Review>A cliché-ridden, thoroughly forgettable, at times just plain dull affair, with broad characterisations and musty plot turns that would seem embarrassing even on TV - where it ideally belongs.</Review>
            <Review>The ending is dynamite and will shock children just as much as The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas.</Review>
            <Review>It's perhaps more TV than cinema, but O'Connor directs with a firm hand, and children will learn valuable lessons from it.</Review>
            <Review>The filmmakers tell this World War I story beautifully, but they never quite bring it to life as a proper movie. By taking a gently simplistic approach, it never feels like anything new as it deals with the usual topics of battlefield camaraderie.</Review>

            <Review>I hardly see the need for this watered-down twist on that '70s TV-movie Bad Ronald.</Review>
            <Review>The Intruders would like to be more clever than it is, but it's hamstrung by a script that's a bit of a fixer-upper.</Review>
            <Review>The Intruders stacks the deck with all the familiar horror signposts, as if straying from clichés were the most frightening thing of all.</Review>
            <Review>I stopped counting the clichés after a while and just sat back and enjoyed a very photogenic cast and familiar story. The camera loves Miranda Cosgrove, and she's convincing as the tortured young woman.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Gracie knows hangovers. She's intimately acquainted with them. But this one? Why did she wake up, half-dressed, on a Florida beach, 1100 miles from home? And this time her father - who also knows about the tragedy of addiction from his struggles with Gracie's mom - isn't going to clean things up. Suspicious and distrustful of everyone, including a caf� owner with a troubled history of her own, Gracie prefers the relief of alcohol - which had always worked for her. When she's arrested for public drunkenness and attacking a police officer, Gracie is given a choice: six months in jail or 90 meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous in 90 days, and she has to do it in the small town she's landed in. She's not used to strangers caring about her, but perhaps the power of community can help her sidestep the landmines lining her path to sobriety - especially the ones she's laid herself. "GRACE." compassionately looks at the disease of addiction through a young woman inching towards redemption.</StoryLine>

            <Review>This low-budget found-footage horror debut from British director Elliot Goldner has plenty of chilling atmosphere but lacks bite.</Review>
            <Review>There's nothing wildly original here, and the gotcha scares get repetitive. But the script is witty, the cast are simply terrific ... a spiky, intelligent little throat-grabber.</Review>
            <Review>takes the viewer to a deep dark place of nightmares, where reason will be devoured by the primordial shadows.</Review>
            <Review>Much of this may sound familiar, but The Borderlands' crafty virtue is that it understands that hand-held camerawork and boo scares aren't an excuse to neglect plot, dialogue or characters.</Review>
            <Review>Much of the build-up may retread familiar The Last Exorcism territory, but the claustrophobic final act is properly alarming scary fare.</Review>
            <Review>Low-budget horror films based around found footage began to seem outdated not long after The Blair Witch Project but this British excursion into the form is surprisingly enjoyable.</Review>
            <Review>Once things start to go bump in the night it all gets yawnsome.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director Elliot Goldner has put together a slow-burn thriller that grips, twists, jostles and pokes.</Review>
            <Review>Low-budget British indie finds absolutely nothing new in the supposedly spooky found-footage subgenre, unless all the typical haunted-house frights occurring in a church counts.</Review>
            <Review>Goldner carefully builds up the tension by creepy increment, neatly switching from Gray's geezer spiel to an all-pervading sense of dread to inextricably draw the viewer in.</Review>

            <Review>You're left with that empty feeling of a surface barely scratched, when the legend that was Cantinflas deserves much more.</Review>
            <Review>While a substantial number of scenes are heavy-handed, the actor who plays Cantinflas- Óscar Jaenada - is a standout.</Review>
            <Review>A rancid narrative, with a simple sketch of the figure of a great popular film comedian. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>This is a movie that's OK, but could've been great. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>

            <Review>For Del Amo, showing us what made Cantinflas work so well for the Mexican and international audiences is not what matters, what matter is him winning a Golden Globe for one of his lesser roles. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>The movie stands on the surprising performance by Spanish actor Óscar Jaenada, very far from mere imitation. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>

            <Review>Traitors operates according to a standard drug-smuggling-drama template, though it colors its familiar elements with just enough distinctive personality to allow it to stand on its own.</Review>
            <Review>A rare genre film from the Maghreb that centers on a female universe, Traitors benefits immensely from a spiky lead turn from newcomer Chaimae Ben Acha, whose innate charisma helps paper over the film's at times overly familiar plot twists.</Review>
            <Review>Gullette strains to make the outcome upbeat, which damages credibility somewhat. Still, lead thesp Chaimae Ben Acha has charisma, and the pic makes the most of a manifestly low budget.</Review>
            <Review>There are not a lot of actual incidents in the film: no chases or shootouts. Yet Gullette creates real tension, through silences, quiet encounters with the drug lord and the extremely expressive face of Ben Acha.</Review>

            <Review>Has the elements of a classic backstage story, but they don't quite crystallize into an integral drama.</Review>
            <Review>It's a movie about a rising superstar that features two of them-Mbatha-Raw and Parker, both enormously appealing, impossibly attractive performers with big futures ahead of them.</Review>
            <Review>"Beyond the Lights" is a faint shadow of 1992's "The Bodyguard," without the star power of Whitney Houston or Kevin Costner.</Review>
            <Review>Director Prince-Bythewood, who made the move from television to the big-screen in 2000 with the terrific romance Love and Basketball has a way with actors.</Review>
            <Review>Unfortunately for a film about the importance of keeping it real, the drama here is largely formulaic, and the finish line crosses into the realm of artistic fantasy.</Review>
            <Review>Every time you want to hoot and dismiss this movie, the next moment it grabs you. Guilty pleasure. Good storytelling. Lurve. Gugu Mbatha-Raw. A star is born.</Review>
            <Review>A carefully calculated romantic drama that spins out the usual manifestos about the music industry devouring pretty young singers yearning for acceptance.</Review>

            <Review>Revealing both the dangers and payoffs of artistic ambition, Whiplash is sure to establish Chazelle as a directorial force to be reckoned with.</Review>
            <Review>The movie swings - physically, musically, psychologically, racially.</Review>
            <Review>It would be an insult to call Chazelle a "promising" filmmaker, as this movie doesn't indicate mere potential - it is evidence of authentic, sometimes blazing talent.</Review>
            <Review>Such a cooked-up piece of claptrap that I half expected Darth Vader to pick up the baton.</Review>
            <Review>'Whiplash' is electric from beginning to end, a musical story of obsession, frustration and outright cruelty built on two knockout performances.</Review>
            <Review>Director Damien Chazelle, who based the story on his own experience as a student jazz drummer in the thrall of an Alpha task-master, has created a remarkably economical and claustrophobic piece of storytelling.</Review>
            <Review>This is not a music movie-the numbers are dense and joyless-it's a sports movie, and a very assured one for a guy clearly reaching for the stars himself.</Review>
            <Review>It's about the social utility of sociopathy, about the refusal to fret over self-esteem or hurt feelings or mental or physical pain in the pursuit of greatness.</Review>
            <Review>It's a thorny, thoughtful movie that asks provocative questions and isn't cocky enough to boast of knowing the answers.</Review>
            <Review>It's a riveting, thrilling film that gets away with an ending that's perhaps just a little too keen to cleanly resolve the jagged drama. But if you ever thought Glee or Fame would be better rendered as a one-on-one psycho-thriller, here's your film.</Review>
            <Review>Fast-paced, intelligent and highly entertaining. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>

            <Review>'Horrible Bosses 2' is so lazy it's not even about horrible bosses.</Review>
            <Review>Horrible Bosses 2 has ditched its predecessor's universality, but kept its amiable good will.</Review>
            <Review>Three years after its nauseating - yet popular - original installment, "Horrible Bosses 2" reunites the cast members in a juvenile, generic and outrageously funny sequel.</Review>
            <Review>It's the small, tossed-off moments-Bateman's deadpan mugging, Day's frenzied cluelessness, and Sudeikis' smarmy one-liners-that land the best.</Review>
            <Review>The follow-up's improbable story involves kidnapping -- 9 to 5, anyone? -- but the worst ransom will be paid by the bilked popcorn munchers who have to sit through this inane bungle of a budding cinematic franchise.</Review>
            <Review>Nothing is quite as cinematically desperate as someone telling you a joke you've already heard only louder.</Review>
            <Review>If you want to define Hollywood mediocrity, it might look something like this: competently shot and executed, but utterly lacking in soul or verve or originality.</Review>
            <Review>There are some laughs to be had (stay for the closing credit bloopers), but the really memorable belly laughs are few and far between.</Review>
            <Review>Rampant racism, misogyny, and homophobia serve as placeholders where actual jokes might have been, with Jennifer Aniston suffering the worst of it.</Review>
            <Review>Arriving to the cinematic Thanskgiving table like that chunky jello salad no one recalls asking for, [it] proves to be more of the same forced, unnecessary comic desperation.</Review>
            <Review>So much idle chatter that it's practically radio--Morning Zoo Crew: The Movie.</Review>
            <Review>The original film had some well-earned laughs. The sequel is a joke, and not a good one.</Review>

            <Review>On the high-quality scale set by the Disney animated features in their latest Renaissance, this one doesn't quite measure up. But Big Hero 6 is sure to entertain millions of smart kids and their escort parents.</Review>
            <Review>Kids will leave the theater wanting their own Baymax, and who can blame them? It's the rest of the "Heroes" that don't measure up; the robot full of air is the most real thing in the movie.</Review>
            <Review>It's easier to like this movie because of the casual, low stakes of the enterprise.</Review>
            <Review>Big Hero 6, the first Marvel comic book to get a Walt Disney makeover, is a beguiling kids movie. It is also a beauty to behold for its skillful digital animation in 3D.</Review>
            <Review>A big, gorgeous, consistently funny and touching animated adventure.</Review>
            <Review>Big Hero 6 offers something for everyone: action, camaraderie, superheroes and villains. But mostly, Baymax offers a compassionate and healing voice for those suffering, and a hug that can be felt through the screen.</Review>
            <Review>What you might not have heard before is the way this film laces that basic story with beautiful themes that push back against some of the assumptions of the genre.</Review>
            <Review>Big Hero 6 is still a boy's own wonder. Baymax is the best movie robot in years.</Review>
            <Review>"Big Hero 6" is a mish-mash of mixed messages, from its "compassion over violence, through violence" finale to its clumsily appropriated Japanese stylistic flourishes.</Review>
            <Review>To say Big Hero 6 is the toddler version of Avengers is inaccurate because that implies it's unworthy of adults' time. Disney's newest is actually one of its most inclusive.</Review>
            <Review>The action is slick and ingenious and although the finale follows the big, bigger, BIGGEST theory of set pieces to become a bit overblown, this is still a lot of fun.</Review>
            <Review>Big Hero 6, in its final stretch, becomes an almost interminable experience.</Review>

            <Review>Like most documentary makers addressing the health care crisis, McGarry can't begin to get his arms around the whole problem; this works best as a highly subjective account of a small portion of it.</Review>
            <Review>It sticks halos (probably well-deserved) atop the heads of its doctors, it goes for poignant moments without being all that poignant and ends up bemoaning without seriously suggesting any concrete paths to improvement.</Review>
            <Review>A must-see for anyone concerned about the state of health care in this country. Which should be all of us.</Review>
            <Review>"Code Black" shows the passion, frustration, and skill of those who work to heal despite the system, but it remains in the dark about why that system is broken and how it can be fixed.</Review>
            <Review>The film refuses polemic, grants access, and mostly steers clear of the heartstrings in its effort to humanize those on both sides of the institutional front line.</Review>
            <Review>"Code Black" presents itself as a demonstration of the current crisis in health care, and it's hard to watch without becoming enraged.</Review>
            <Review>Real-life ER doctors crafted this superb documentary as a cry for help. Our U.S. healthcare system is about to break down. 'Code Black' stands for an overflowing waiting room.</Review>
            <Review>"Code Black" is "ER" on steroids.</Review>
            <Review>Amazing, edifying look at ground zero of urban health care</Review>
            <Review>...most satisfying when concentrating on the here and now-this patient needs this procedure now-and works less well when it tries to take on bigger issues.</Review>
            <Review>Code Black appeals to our better natures while remaining aware of the money needed to let those better natures reign. It makes a strong case.</Review>
            <Review>A worthy but uneven testament to those who work to save some of the many still excluded from a social safety net that never seems to expand fast enough.</Review>

            <Review>The performances are strong... and Earle is particularly memorable. The film glows with a dark energy when he's on screen. But it's too long, has a musical soundtrack that's often intrusive, and sometimes sags when it should be taut with tension</Review>
            <Review>Jeremy Irvine is the sympathetic focus, but it's Noah Wyle who holds the movie together, as a former teacher who lost his job through a malicious student's prank.</Review>
            <Review>Fine performances compensate for the overwrought elements of this rural-set drama.</Review>
            <Review>The Civil War was about the South not wanting to give up its slaves. Now it won't give up its drugs. 'Rednecks and drugs: one of the worst hookups of the '60s.'</Review>

            <Review>Mature coming-of-age adaptation has violence, drugs.</Review>
            <Review>Yes, this is one of those low-budget gems you're always hearing about. Sub-par production values, certainly. But an intriguing story with excellent acting.</Review>
            <Review>There's an authenticity to the characters and the atmosphere in this deliberately paced drama.</Review>
            <Review>For all the good intentions and native hands behind the camera, The World Set Straight never seems particularly credible or convincing as a fresh look at regional history.</Review>

            <Review>"Dying of the Light" is a shrill and bombastic slog, with an all-over-the-map collection of tones that never cohere into a credible or compelling vision.</Review>
            <Review>The rushed and often inchoate execution means there's little in the film that gets the benefit of more than a moment's reflection.</Review>
            <Review>A weirdly misshapen, fitfully intriguing depiction of one man's wayward quest for justice, plainly compromised in ways that only a director's cut could properly illuminate.</Review>
            <Review>On a commercial level, "Dying of the Light" sometimes plays as just another high-concept vehicle for a comically overacting Mr. Cage. But Mr. Schrader's vision is strong enough to rage against the hackier calculations.</Review>
            <Review>Cage's loop-di-loop performance, the movie's surviving asset, at least hints at the themes of institutional illness and mortal decline that must have fascinated Schrader.</Review>
            <Review>It plays out as a more or less conventional direct-to-video-style thriller, distinguished by a handful of subtexts and images that might have been developed in a different version, but here register as mere quirks.</Review>
            <Review>It's just not that bad, especially compared to some of the recent gems in the Cage filmography. Frankly, it probably doesn't even crack the bottom 20.</Review>
            <Review>It's a film full of Cage at his wide-eyed, extreme intensity, but many of the scenes seem to lose the process that made them.</Review>
            <Review>Not much good to say except "Cage, Cage against the dying of the light." Apologies to Dylan Thomas.</Review>
            <Review>despite all the formulaic flaws and re-workings of Schrader's original artistic vision, Cage steals the show.</Review>
            <Review>Nicolas Cage wigs out again as an unhinged CIA agent in this espionage thriller, but this time it's his ragged prosthetic ear rather than his hairpiece that grabs the viewer's attention.</Review>
            <Review>The plotting doesn't make much sense but Cage gives a typically flamboyant and uneven performance as the stubborn old agent.</Review>

            <Review>"As admirably cohesive as the story is, it's far surpassed by the wonderfully committed lead performances. Harking back to the rubber-face zaniness of his breakthrough years, Carrey elicits childlike wonder at his hyperactive expressions and movements."</Review>
            <Review>I wish I could put as little thought into writing about Dumb and Dumber To as the Farrelly brothers did in making it.</Review>
            <Review>Time can be cruel, especially to sequels.</Review>
            <Review>The directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly cram the movie with puns and those kinds of sight gags. Almost none of them work.</Review>
            <Review>I reckon four out of every five jokes played to silence at the preview screening. If Dumb and Dumber To were a live comedian, he'd have said, "Is this an audience or an oil painting?" He'd have left the stage in tears.</Review>
            <Review>Is it a good movie? Only if you think the sight of a cat high on meth wildly swinging from a chandelier in the background is hilarious.</Review>
            <Review>A surprisingly funny film that lands just enough jokes not to desecrate its predecessor. Sometimes the soft bigotry of low expectations is a blessing, not a curse.</Review>
            <Review>Best to leave this one to the diehard fans, who should stay for the post-credit shenanigans.</Review>
            <Review>It's an absolute joy to see Lloyd Christmas again, and Carrey seems impossibly revitalized.</Review>
            <Review>We can only take so many fart jokes and offensive material before beginning to look for something fresh. [The original] was fresh in 1994, but [this] is just plain tired.</Review>
            <Review>I hardly laughed at all.</Review>
            <Review>Shot so unimaginatively that it seems to have been unearthed from a crate marked '90s Generic Comedy--Sell In Corner-Store Bins. A climactic chase ends in a men's toilet--the lame-ass setting doing double-dooty as a metaphor for this movie's quality.</Review>

            <Review>Parts of The Homesman are a slog to sit through, but the movie ends on a note of absurd comedy that also breaks your heart, suggesting that some people, no matter the circumstances, are incapable of change.</Review>
            <Review>If only things had started out on more solid ground and headed toward some sort of resolution. If only.</Review>
            <Review>The film has more surprising turns than a honeycomb has bees. Absurdity and calamity collide without warning.</Review>
            <Review>Swank, an Oscar winner for "Boys Don't Cry" and "Million Dollar Baby," is outstanding, getting to the essence of Mary Bee's pride and pain. And in the showier role, Jones impressively peels away layers of rambunctiousness to reveal George's humanity.</Review>
            <Review>Swank and Streep are big stars with famous faces, and yet disappear into their roles; these characters convey both quiet strength and gentle kindness.</Review>
            <Review>As the protagonists near their final destination, The Homesman offers a critique of civilization that's almost as pessimistic as its critique of frontier life, suggesting that in every corner of America there have always been more losers than winners.</Review>
            <Review>A fair portion of Tommy Lee's life has been dedicated to telling stories about schlepping variously incapacitated or dead people long distances through the Wild West.</Review>
            <Review>If 'The Homesman' proves anything, it's that there's no movie that can't get a shot in the arm from a couple scenes of Tommy Lee Jones hollerin' and dancin'.</Review>
            <Review>If Jones wants to become a great director of a dying genre, he cannot simply hope to mimic what the masters did. He must instead explore the meaning of each image he creates.</Review>
            <Review>With his sophomore effort, The Homesman, Jones gives us a revisionist Western that defies expectations at every turn. It's a genuine art film in the vein of Aussie productions like The Proposition.</Review>
            <Review>A stubbornly uncommercial and richly challenging inversion of Americana, this time with an eye towards the pioneer women pushed to the margins of our history books.</Review>
            <Review>It reminds us repeatedly of how fragile civilization was in the Old West.</Review>

            <Review>Like any franchise, a third outing is difficult to pull off yet, and such is the case here, with few ample rewards to be found.</Review>
            <Review>As a collective, there's great, good and average to be had here. It's always a risk run with these anthologies, but the audience is there for them and Viral is a good addition to the series.</Review>
            <Review>Not nearly as consistent as its predecessors, but at least two of the segments are quite solid.</Review>
            <Review>After much white noise and other loud sounds along with annoying picture fluctuations, the individual horror segments begin. None of them are impressive.</Review>

            <Review>Though hardcore fans of the series will no doubt walk away at least somewhat satisfied by Viral's offerings, it definitely skimps out on horror in favor of more playful and loose genre riffing.</Review>
            <Review>I credit it for really engaging with our culture's omnipresent voyeurism instead of just using it as an excuse to cut the budget.</Review>

            <Review>What comes through most in Life Itself, a film named after Ebert's 2011 memoir, is his great, open-minded vigor.</Review>
            <Review>If you aren't moved by Life Itself, you ought to have your heart examined.</Review>
            <Review>The film's core is footage shot during the last four months of Ebert's life, when he had lost most of his jaw and was unable to eat or speak. It's hard to see him in this state, which makes his frequent cheerfulness and humor all the more remarkable.</Review>
            <Review>No less than James's capital punishment documentary At the Death House Door, this asks us to think long and hard about what it means to die with dignity.</Review>
            <Review>That [Siskel and Ebert] weren't very nice to each other might be the too-easy takeaway of outtakes of their on-set interactions. James allows that relationship to be more complicated and vital.</Review>

            <Review>Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is the sort of movie that ends up on a person's favourite-movies-of-all-time list. It's really that fresh.</Review>
            <Review>The brazenly off-kilter comedy offers a blistering look at how an industry rat race can decimate a man's self-worth.</Review>
            <Review>Birdman takes advantage of every facet of Keaton's talent, from his knack for absurdist comedy to his seemingly effortless ability to tap into graceful profundity without making a big show of it.</Review>
            <Review>Lots to unpack, lots to enjoy. Trigger warning: Jazz drums.</Review>
            <Review>The refusal of the camera to cut from scene to scene despite the film taking place over days of rehearsal and performances lends the proceedings a dream-like quality.</Review>
            <Review>A thunderbolt reminder of the kind of quick-thinking, quick-talking, quick-witted characters that Keaton used to specialize in, and Iñárritu finds the right style to showcase his gifts.</Review>
            <Review>Packs motion picture, stage play, graphic novel, and gossip column into one surprisingly accessible 100-minute package, tying it together with ribbons of scalding satire.</Review>
            <Review>One of the most dazzling, entertaining and mind-bending films of the year.</Review>
            <Review>You never do find out what we talk about when we talk about love, but this wonderfully inexplicable movie is well worth adoring.</Review>

            <Review>Pleasing to watch... but [leaves] little lasting impression.</Review>
            <Review>There's a mischievous quality to Redmayne that seems a good match with the wit Hawking has always managed to convey with a raised eyebrow and a mechanically-voiced quip.</Review>
            <Review>If the film unfolds like a fairytale, at least it's a fairytale that doesn't often get told.</Review>
            <Review>There's little acrimony in The Theory of Everything, which may reflect Hawking's actual outlook or just the movie's puppyish desire to please.</Review>
            <Review>Director Marsh is a gifted documentarian, but at this point, his dramatic technique is too shallow to get inside his characters' heads.</Review>
            <Review>The film both adheres to and gently upends the conventions of the Great Man genre.</Review>
            <Review>In an era seriously lacking in serious movie stars, it's great to see young actors like Jones and Redmayne get to go for broke in a movie that mostly deserves them.</Review>
            <Review>It's all slavishly conformed into a woefully predictable formula, as inflexible as the Meet Cute Rom-Com or the Superhero Epic, every scene less about capturing a moment from a life than about completing a checklist.</Review>
            <Review>A sensitive, middle-brow and conventional film, with key moments in Hawking's life structured neatly, and with every emotional button being pushed just at the right pressure.</Review>
            <Review>Attention has rightly focused on Redmayne's extraordinary work as the steadily shrivelling Hawking, and the sense of mischief that he conjures using only his eyes is something to behold. But Jones is terrific as Jane, whose story the film is, really.</Review>
            <Review>A small-minded portrait of subject who's anything but.</Review>
            <Review>For relying more on emotions than the fascinating knowledge contained in Hawking's mind, The Theory of Everything could've employed more complexity.</Review>

            <Review>Sentimental slop.</Review>
            <Review>While the film is stuffed with cliches, at least they're the warm and fuzzy kind.</Review>
            <Review>St. Vincent will dodge your impulse to projectile vomit. For that, all hail Bill Murray who whacks away at the script's sentimental softballs like A-Rod in full swing.</Review>
            <Review>The adult supporting players are all excellent, but next to Murray, the key casting is Jaeden Lieberher as young Oliver. The kid is a natural in the sidekick role, never once playing it too cute or too actor-y.</Review>
            <Review>It's good to see funny gal McCarthy playing the straight woman in this comedy rather than the appealing/appalling lout. It's even better to see a working mom depicted with care.</Review>
            <Review>St. Vincent is no conventional hagiography but it's the movie world's equivalent - a star vehicle. Give director Melfi credit for knowing the capacity of the engine he has under its hood.</Review>
            <Review>St. Vincent is both enjoyable and tear-making-it's a terrific debut for Lieberher-even though you really, really know better.</Review>
            <Review>A lovely little movie with a lot of laughs and a good heart - and a warning signal for a direction Murray's career could take, if he's not careful.</Review>
            <Review>Yes, we have seen this story before, but St Vincent is a warm, enjoyable yarn with just enough sharp lines and laugh out loud moments to see you through.</Review>
            <Review>With his first feature film, writer-director Theodore Melfi has accomplished what many inveterate filmmakers haven't - he's gotten Bill Murray to come alive.</Review>
            <Review>If it wasn't for Bill Murray injecting his caustic side into this film it would be unbearably saccharine and schmaltzy. Thankfully, he embraces his role as a hard-drinking, curmudgeon of a gambler with a pregnant Russian stripper girlfriend.</Review>
            <Review>You will leave this film wishing that Murray could be your friend for life, as his performance of St. Vincent reminds us again what a versatile comic he is.</Review>

            <Review>The suffocating level of redundancy on display kneecaps any legitimate chance the film had at embracing social satire.</Review>
            <Review>The Interview is marked by a true naiveté about international perception and what can be gotten away with in the name of "all in good fun."</Review>
            <Review>What's wrong with The Interview is that it doesn't know how to be the singeing comedy it wants.</Review>
            <Review>Te best satire provokes and even outrages, and Rogen, Franco and Goldberg certainly succeed on that score.</Review>
            <Review>This is what all the fuss was about?</Review>
            <Review>It's stupid. It's in bad taste. It impossible. I know all that. But Rogen's instinct to try anything for giggles and sticking it to dictatorial assholes is worth fighting for. Screw Kim if he can't take a joke.</Review>
            <Review>Even the film's most ardent champions would likely concede that The Interview is a spectacularly weird film to end up at the center of a free speech brouhaha.</Review>
            <Review>It's funny and strange, with an admirably gonzo sensibility, and it approaches the job of mocking Kim with the appropriate degree of joy-buzzer delight.</Review>
            <Review>[Franco's] free-spirited screen presence gives the film the kind of anarchic momentum it requires, mirroring its totally-serious-but-not-at-all-serious bent.</Review>
            <Review>The Interview, conversely, is little more than a sloppy air kiss blown lazily under the banner of free speech.</Review>
            <Review>I liked it for what it is.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Ian B. Folivor hasn't left his apartment in months, and it shows. He clearly doesn't stand a chance with the lovely young neighbor he watches through his peephole, the closest he comes to human contact is fielding occasional threats from his sociopathic landlord and he may have just lost his last friend-an ancient television set named Kent. Just when he's ready to end it all with a powerful mixture of household chemicals, a would-be mentor appears in a most unlikely place. His self-appointed life coach promises everything Ian could ask for, but Ian is uncertain. Is his new friend a savior appeared in the nick of time, or a smooth-talking force of evil? And is it coincidence or something more sinister that brings peddlers of plasma screens pushing to replace Kent to the door just as this new influence enters Ian's very small world? As Ian is guided down an increasingly twisted and murky path, his doubts about his own judgment and perceptions mushroom. Amazing transformations and steps in the right direction are coupled with disjointed events and blurred reality. With no human voice of reason remaining in his life, he finds himself torn between the promising but alarming counsel of his would-be guide and the long-trusted insights of his old television set.

        <StoryLine>Admit it: you don't really read the endless terms and conditions connected to every website you visit, phone call you make or app you download. But every day, billion-dollar corporations are learning more about your interests, your friends and family, your finances, and your secrets... and are not only selling the information to the highest bidder, but freely sharing it with the government. And you agreed to all of it. With fascinating examples and so-unbelievable-they're-almost-funny facts, filmmaker Cullen Hoback exposes what governments and corporations are legally taking from you every day - turning the future of both privacy and civil liberties uncertain. From whistle blowers and investigative journalists to zombie fan clubs and Egyptian dissidents, this disquieting expos� demonstrates how every one of us has incrementally opted-in to a real-time surveillance state, click by click- and what, if anything, can be done about it.(c) Variance Films</StoryLine>

            <Review>Christian moviegoers will no doubt appreciate a family-friendly movie with a message they can endorse. But it's going to take more than pretty pictures to convert doubters.</Review>

            <Review>This is the kind of sleek, precisely constructed genre work that's gone missing from American summer movies.</Review>
            <Review>There are more tears than the title lets on, and even more blood, but it's a reason to truly be invested that's missing.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director Lee Jeong-beom certainly understands action. When he gets the story right, his films will get a wider audience in the U.S.</Review>
            <Review>No Tears for the Dead has some of the most jaw-dropping action any film could ask for, but the other factors of the film are so weak that they fail to make as much of an impact or any sort of impact at all other than severe irritation.</Review>
            <Review>The first hour is uneven, but some of the action scenes in the second half rival THE RAID 2.</Review>
            <Review>Several dim-witted moments make it difficult to appreciate the movie's finer points - specifically the appealing cast and some grizzly action directed with verve and panache.</Review>
            <Review>Although made with care and sporting impressive production values, No Tears for the Dead (released in Korea as The Crying Man) feels counterfeit, from its tired plot to its maudlin characters.</Review>

Yvette Yzon (ZOMBIES: THE BEGINNING), Gaetano Russo (CAGED WOMEN) and Jim Gaines (THE ONE-ARMED EXECUTIONER) star in this beloved Mattei jaw-dropper from the screenwriter of Fulci's A CAT IN THE BRAIN, now presented uncut and uncensored for the first time ever in America!</StoryLine>

            <Review>The basic story's narrative and psychological simplicity - characters stating their beliefs over and over again - becomes an increasing burden.</Review>
            <Review>A substandard "crime drama" that reeks of the Idiot Plot Syndrome.</Review>
            <Review>"After the Fall" belongs to a type of movie that is too lazy to connect the dots and fill in the blanks between its supposedly teachable moments.</Review>
            <Review>If you can avoid dwelling on its derivative qualities, "After the Fall" has its own case to make about how far the middle class has fallen - and continues to slide.</Review>
            <Review>[The film] has much to recommend, including gorgeous New Mexico landscapes, sumptuous digital cinematography and -- as we might expect from Klein -- virtuoso editing.</Review>
            <Review>Scanlon's desperate dive into a life of armed robbery is simply not believable, despite Bentley's best efforts.</Review>
            <Review>There are hints along the way of the socioeconomic strife that Klein wants to explore, yet they become lost in a muddled screenplay that doesn't establish sympathy for its protagonist or his plight.</Review>
            <Review>Forgettable...Bentley is bland, first scene to last, and thanks to its subject, the film is instantly dated</Review>
            <Review>Fall isn't going to cure the world's ills, but it does define a few of them to satisfaction, creating an engrossing journey into extremity without ringing all the obvious bells on the way down.</Review>
            <Review>A film that could only succeed by sorting through gradually darkening shades of gray works exclusively in embarrassingly bold strokes.</Review>
            <Review>Moral ambiguity is center stage, and the film ultimately succeeds by sending audiences home to ponder their own levels of sin.</Review>

            <Review>A deeply cynical movie masquerading as a complex moral dilemma, the Australian drama "Felony" proves only that skilled actors and slick photography can tart up even the most problematic script.</Review>
            <Review>Starring a trio of top male actors in splendid roles, the intricate, intimate "Felony" is a police story crossed with a perceptive psychological drama.</Review>
            <Review>It's a rare treat to see a suspenseful crime drama delivered with so much nuance and restraint.</Review>
            <Review>There's nothing glamorous about Felony's depiction of police work. These are stressed-out cops, flailing under pressure.</Review>
            <Review>Strong acting all 'round helps, but unfortunately this is just a slow ride to nowhere.</Review>
            <Review>A lifeless Australian morality play about three corrupt police officers who cover up a hit-and-run.</Review>
            <Review>It's unfortunately weighted down by a plodding pace and a depressing, dull narrative that reveals nothing about the characters or human morality.</Review>
            <Review>It's potentially juicy morality-play material, but Edgerton's script does nothing novel with it, so that most of Felony is a long, drawn-out slog</Review>
            <Review>It's an impressive piece of writing, keeping one hand on formula while the other searches for the truth of the moment, finding all sorts of unseemly and desperate behavior to dissect.</Review>
            <Review>It's Wilkinson who's the true standout as a boozy, belligerent, woefully compromised soul.</Review>
            <Review>Not even the always dynamic Tom Wilkinson ... can save Felony from Edgerton's preachy screenplay and a performance that lacks personality and a clear point of view.</Review>

        <Duration>138</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Southern Baptist Sissies is a film of the theatrical experience of writer/director Del Shores' GLAAD Award-winning play about four gay boys growing up in the Southern Baptist church. It explores the conflict between the caustic rhetoric of dogmatic religion and the fragile development of adolescent homosexuality while challenging hypocrisy, exposing damage and offering hope. The intimate experience of theatre on the film screen reveals the complicated emotions from all sides - the confused child, the struggling adolescent and the angry and damaged adult.

            <Review>The pieces of the play fit together a little too neatly, but "Southern Baptist Sissies" has many powerful displays of heavy emotion, building to a cathartic climax.</Review>
            <Review>To call it stagey is an understatement, since it is simply a filmed version of a performance of (Del Shores') play. As such, it is also overlong at 138 minutes without the benefit of an intermission and comes across as preachy and pedantic.</Review>
            <Review>A filmed staging of Del Shores' provocative stage play, this movie is an engaging exploration of the point where religion and sexuality collide in the American South.</Review>

            <Review>The main question Rosewater grapples with is whether Stewart can hack it as a filmmaker. The answer: sort of?</Review>
            <Review>Rosewater certainly has merit as an act of atonement on Stewart's part and a tribute to people like Bahari... In the end, however, the movie needs to stand on its own, apart from its noble intentions and the popularity of its writer-director.</Review>
            <Review>The hard-focus clarity of the images (Bobby Bukowski did the cinematography) leads to an intimacy with anguish that passes into expressionism.</Review>
            <Review>This is Jon Stewart's directorial debut; the talk show comedian has a handle on the material and conveys it clearly.</Review>
            <Review>Rosewater ... has an urgency that's all about the storytelling smarts of its first-time writer-director.</Review>
            <Review>Stewart does a credible job of maintaining the story's immediacy, but I must say I felt relieved that the film wasn't a masterpiece. If it was, we'd have more reason to fear Stewart will leave The Daily Show.</Review>
            <Review>[Rosewater features] fine playing from Bernal and Bodnia, and striking mixing of real and recreated footage of the riots that transpired after the rigged election.</Review>
            <Review>We rarely get the sense that Stewart is talking down to us - which is why it's such a disappointment that 'Rosewater', is so often pitched and played like a carefully dumbed-down TV movie.</Review>
            <Review>For the most part Rosewater is well-acted, tension-filled and slyly iconoclastic. Say hello to Jon Stewart, movie director.</Review>
            <Review>It's a somewhat bumpy road for the first time filmmaker, but it's surprisingly effective when it needs to be.</Review>
            <Review>Despite a few stylistic flourishes, the production is an earnest and straightforward account of what happened, with moments of naturalistic humor based on some major miscommunication.</Review>
            <Review>Stewart proves himself an adept visual stylist here, using simple techniques such as lighting scenes using the glow of a laptop screen to reflect the darkness that comes from being physically cut off from the people Bahari cares about the most.</Review>
