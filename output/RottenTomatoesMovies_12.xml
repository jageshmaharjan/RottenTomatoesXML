        <Duration>92</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Raised in the mountains of Tennessee, Wayne White started his career as a cartoonist in New York City. He quickly found success as one of the creators of the TV show, Pee-wee's Playhouse, which led to more work designing some of the most arresting and iconic images in pop culture. The film chronicles the vaulted highs and the crushing lows of a commercial artist struggling to find peace and balance between his work and his art. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>"Beauty Is Embarrassing" is an undeniably likable film, mainly because White is a likable guy who believes comedy is at least as important as tragedy.</Review>
            <Review>Neil Berkeley's infectiously affectionate portrait of artist, puppeteer and genially profane provocateur Wayne White.</Review>
            <Review>An amiable if not especially urgent celebration of the life and work of Wayne White.</Review>
            <Review>It remains a story at all times - there's a moment at a book signing that will give you a big smile and goosebumps - and it keeps throwing great things to look at up on the screen.</Review>
            <Review>His art is a force that can't be contained: No wonder he felt so at home in the warped environs of Pee-wee's Playhouse.</Review>
            <Review>The doc meanders occasionally, but we're grateful when it comes back to White and his creations.</Review>
            <Review>This is certainly not to suggest that White's work is worthless or unimpressive, but the way it is sold to us is predictable and unclever.</Review>
            <Review>Judging from this documentary, his character is as exuberant as his work, and he seems to be one of those lucky people who simply can't stop creating...</Review>
            <Review>If for no other reason, the film should at least be seen for its visuals -- or, rather, for White's visuals.</Review>
            <Review>Using animation, CGI and stop-motion, and mixing analog and digital video, director Berkeley transforms 'Beauty Is Embarrassing' into a White-inspired but Berkeley made work of pop-folk art</Review>
            <Review>It's ... indulgent, not admitting that White's new gimmick wears out its welcome, and never making the case that White deserves his own documentary.</Review>
            <Review>This isn't necessarily a life-altering work, but there's no denying that the fun White gets out of his work is pretty irresistible.</Review>

        <Title>Wild River</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 1960</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>115</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Filmed on location in the Tennessee Valley, Wild River is set in the early 1930s. Montgomery Clift plays an idealistic TVA agent, assigned to convince the locals to move from their property so that a beneficial dam can be built. The principal holdout is feisty octogenarian Jo Van Fleet, who refuses to budge from her land, convinced that she will die if she ever gives an inch. Her prophecy turns out to be true, as Van Fleet becomes yet another sacrifice to progress. Clift also runs into opposition because of his fair treatment of the local black population. Lee Remick costars as Van Fleet's granddaughter, who comes to love and understand the sensitive Clift. Some dated fuzzy-headed liberalism aside, Wild River is a masterful recreation of a difficult, complex period in American history. Watch for an uncredited Bruce Dern in his film debut. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>Both sections of the flavorful, vernacular-filled screen play have been given professional treatment.</Review>
            <Review>This 1960 drama is probably Elia Kazan's finest and deepest film, a meditation on how the past both inhibits and enriches the present.</Review>
            <Review>In studying a slice of national socio-economic progress in terms of people, it catches something timeless and essential in the human spirit and shapes it in the American image.</Review>
            <Review>One of [Kazan's] least theatrical and most affecting films.</Review>
            <Review>Kazan's films are better known for showcasing stratospheric Method-emoting over visual expressiveness, which makes Wild River's gorgeous imagery a shock...</Review>
            <Review>Sympathetic to both sides, the movie pits tradition against progress, rugged individualism against the greater good.</Review>
            <Review>It's an expansive work, distinguished by exceptional location photography, but, as ever, (Kazan's) focus is on complex interpersonal relationships.</Review>
            <Review>Shooting predominantly on location in Tennessee, Kazan makes evocative use of the mist that hangs over the river like a lingering regret.</Review>
            <Review>Montgomery Clift gives a superbly tender performance in one of his last and most tortured roles, and Lee Remick is touching as his confidante.</Review>
            <Review>The grim inevitability of the eviction gives the film a melancholy power.</Review>
            <Review>This dramatic tug-of-war between progress and tradition remains a memorable example of director Kazan at his best.</Review>
            <Review>Evocative sociological/historical melodrama.</Review>

            <Review>Wake in Fright is essential viewing for anyone interested in the roots of male violence.</Review>
            <Review>A Conradian parable of a man succumbing to the wild, the film is remarkable for its raw, pointed dithe suggests, and you'll find the beast concealed behind the mask of propriety.</Review>
            <Review>It is powerful, genuinely shocking and rather amazing.</Review>
            <Review>Several decades later, it still chills.</Review>
            <Review>"Wake in Fright" is true horror.</Review>
            <Review>"Wake in Fright" is a monster movie, and the monster is us.</Review>
            <Review>This movie gets under your skin.</Review>
            <Review>Wake in Fright is an absolute must-see for fans of cult, off-kilter cinema.</Review>
            <Review>Blends staged re-enactments with documentary footage of senseless slaughter to extremely distressing effect.</Review>
            <Review>Brilliantly directed by Kotcheff, the film has the disorienting and menacing quality of Joseph Losey films such as Accident and The Servant.</Review>
            <Review>It presents a world in which refusing a pint has violent consequences, high spirits quickly curdle, and an unspoken homoerotic undertow gets ever more disturbing.</Review>
            <Review>Forms a neatly symmetrical, perfectly Kafkaesque narrative. This way madness lies . . .</Review>

        <StoryLine>George Ruben, a man out of step with the 21st century, is pathologically nostalgic for things that used to be and never will again. He sets out obsessively to chronicle these items in an opus he dubs The Obselidia. On his quest to catalogue critically endangered occupations, George meets the beautiful Sophie, a cinema projectionist who works at a local art house movie theater. Sophie's a vivacious free spirit, who lives life in the moment and rarely stops to look back. She romantically believes that nothing is obsolete so long as someone loves it. New to LA and a little lonely after breaking up with her long-time boyfriend, Sophie pursues a friendship with George. She allows him to interview her about her own work for The Obselidia -- and she becomes fascinated by this guy who's quite unlike anyone she's ever met. He doesn't use a computer, he doesn't own a car, and he seems so earnest and sincere. When Sophie learns that George is planning a trip out to Death Valley, via public transport, in order to interview a maverick scientist, Lewis Fordham, who is predicting the eminent end of the world, she steps in and insists that she drive him.</StoryLine>

            <Review>There may be need for an exorcist, but the power of Christ isn't going to compel the Jewish demon wreaking havoc in this competent but shopworn horror film.</Review>
            <Review>The first half of The Possession is suitably atmospheric and reasonably creepy.</Review>
            <Review>The film is basically a compendium of possessed-child clichés reaching back to The Exorcist.</Review>
            <Review>Another horror movie about a little girl possessed by a demon? Seriously?</Review>
            <Review>The script, credited to Juliet Snowden and Stiles White, adheres so closely to formula that it's possible to predict not only which characters will end up dead, but in what order ...</Review>
            <Review>Not every film needs to reinvent the wheel, and nothing here is particularly ground-breaking, yet this is one of the more satisfying horror jaunts in quite some time.</Review>
            <Review>...a better-than-expected variation on an exceedingly hoary theme...</Review>
            <Review>Puppet-master technique and a generally well orchestrated sense of moodiness help this chiller deliver on more than it botches, despite a fumbled third act.</Review>

            <Review>It mixes attempts at realism and grit with transparently Hollywoodized good guys-vs.-bad guys social melodrama. That requires a deft directorial hand, but director Daniel Barnz doesn't seem to have it.</Review>
            <Review>Social-issue movies can have real societal impact. That's why Won't Back Down, which presses a lot of hot buttons, deserves to be taken seriously, and criticized seriously, on its own terms.</Review>
            <Review>Won't Back Down doesn't wholly make the grade.</Review>
            <Review>Americans desperately need to have some difficult conversations about the state of public education, but Won't Back Down goes about the task too awkwardly to be helpful or interesting.</Review>
            <Review>"Won't Back Down" details a bureaucratic process, and yet it plays more like an intense, emotional movie about parents and children.</Review>
            <Review>While the cast is filled with award winners, writer-director Daniel Barnz is a dunce who can't construct an argument without employing flimsy logic and cardboard characters.</Review>
            <Review>"Won't Back Down" packs a punch and it deserves to be seen, no matter one's political persuasion.</Review>
            <Review>Funded by conservative Christian billionaire Phil Anschutz and released by rightwing overlord Rupert Murdoch, it attempts to fashion a feel-good family-friendly triumph of union busting and privatization.</Review>
            <Review>While the story is predictable, it compensates for that with great acting and a noble purpose.</Review>
            <Review>A do-gooder movie so stupid and unoriginal it had to steal its title from a Tom Petty song.</Review>
            <Review>'Dumbing down' a film about educational reform defeats any point; while proficiently made, Won't Back Down's glib feel-good message deserves to fall on deaf ears.</Review>

            <Review>Once upon a time, calling a movie "lesser Woody Allen" might be considered a slap in the face. Now, it's more-or-less expected.</Review>
            <Review>Allen's story moves along quite wonderfully, primarily because of his nuanced casting.</Review>
            <Review>Most of the characters are archetypes, yet Allen treats them with genuine affection and avoids the bitterness that's marred much of his recent work.</Review>
            <Review>It's minor Woody, but it's still Woody.</Review>
            <Review>Not great, but not grating.</Review>
            <Review>Midnight in Paris was profound in a deceptively breezy way. To Rome With Love is just plain breezy, but I didn't mind.</Review>
            <Review>Weightless and harmless and made with good cheer.</Review>
            <Review>The value of 'Rome' is reduced by Allen's inability to fluidly meld the overlapping story lines.</Review>
            <Review>Inconsistencies in time and space elements, and a plot that echoes an episode of The Flintstones, join generally underdeveloped attempts at suspending disbelief to mar Allen's attempt to represent the city of Fellini.</Review>
            <Review>Compared to "Midnight in Paris," this homage isn't nearly as sure-footed.</Review>

        <StoryLine>The Chicago 8 is the true story from the notorious 1968 trial that resulted when seven leaders of a Vietnam anti-war movement, and a member of the Black Panthers, were charged with conspiracy to incite devastating riots in Chicago. Desperate to stop what they saw as an "immoral war", this group was ready to take on the establishment, express their freedom of speech by all means necessary, while paying a price for their actions. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

        <ReleaseDate> 2012</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>90</Duration>
        <StoryLine>An extraordinary work of both cinematic and political activism, 5 Broken Cameras is a deeply personal, first-hand account of non-violent resistance in Bil'in, a West Bank village threatened by encroaching Israeli settlements. Shot almost entirely by Palestinian farmer Emad Burnat, who bought his first camera in 2005 to record the birth of his youngest son, the footage was later given to Israeli co-director Guy Davidi to edit. Structured around the violent destruction of each one of Burnat's cameras, the filmmakers' collaboration follows one family's evolution over five years of village turmoil. Burnat watches from behind the lens as olive trees are bulldozed, protests intensify, and lives are lost. "I feel like the camera protects me," he says, "but it's an illusion." -- (C) Kino Lorber</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>Award-winning filmmaker Yung Chang returns to China for another riveting documentary on that country's ever-changing economic landscape-this time through the lens of sports. In China Heavyweight, Chang follows the charismatic Qi Moxiang, a former boxing star and state coach who recruits young fighting talent from the impoverished farms and villages across Sichuan province. A select few boys (and girls) are sent to national training centers, with the hope of discovering China's next Olympic heroes. But will these potential boxing champions leave it all behind to be the next Mike Tyson? Their rigorous training, teenage trials and family tribulations are expertly intertwined with Coach Qi's own desire to get back in the ring for one more shot at victory. -- (C) Zeitgeist</StoryLine>

            <Review>Focuses on the stories of three boxers and weaves them into a compelling narrative that rivals anything Hollywood could script.</Review>
            <Review>Yung seems to anticipate real-life emotional beats and positions his camera at exactly the right moments, yet nothing seems artificial or scripted. The result is an unexpectedly tender film about the price of coming into one's own.</Review>
            <Review>The documentary is fluid, detailed and well photographed by Sun Shaoguang.</Review>
            <Review>Perhaps by focusing on something that is so much an individual sport, Chang creates a deep sense of tension between singular people and the bigger concerns of history, the team or country.</Review>
            <Review>China Heavyweight is an uneasy mixture of familiar sports doc tropes and sociological portraiture.</Review>
            <Review>Chang works within the philosophical framework of the world of boxing to paint a poignant and often incisive portrait of the evolving Chinese cultural landscape and the temptations and ambitions that come with change.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2012</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>100</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Farewell, My Queen marks the return of acclaimed director Beno�t Jacquot and brilliantly captures the passions, debauchery, occasional glimpses of nobility and ultimately the chaos that engulfed the court of Marie Antoinette in the final days before the full-scale outbreak of the Revolution. Based on the best-selling novel by Chantal Thomas, the film stars L�a Seydoux as one of Marie's ladies-in-waiting, seemingly an innocent but quietly working her way into her mistress's special favors, until history tosses her fate onto a decidedly different path. With the action moving effortlessly from the gilded drawing rooms of the nobles to the back quarters of those who serve them, this is a period film at once accurate and sumptuous in its visual details and modern in its emotions. -- (C) Cohen</StoryLine>

            <Review>Jacquot has chosen wisely in casting Léa Seydoux in the key role of Sidonie, whose luminous but watchful eyes suggest a soul wise beyond her years.</Review>
            <Review>"Farewell, My Queen" is a layer cake of royal pleasures, rote protocols and revolutionary politics. For skeptics who thought this story had grown stale, let them eat their words.</Review>
            <Review>The details of the plot are unimportant: that is the main point made by the skillful director, Benoît Jacquot. It is the slowness with which they realize what is happening that fascinates.</Review>
            <Review>Although it was shot at Versailles, and its actors are dressed to the 18th-century nines, Farewell, My Queen has a loose, reportorial intimacy about it.</Review>
            <Review>As we follow her through the monarchy's abrupt collapse, "Farewell, My Queen" gives us intimate, unflaggingly energetic history as seen from the servants' quarters.</Review>
            <Review>The foreboding and chaos contrast neatly with the lavish costumes and sets.</Review>
            <Review>Farewell, My Queen is a knife-edge drama that steadily builds tension that at times becomes as unbearably tense as the relationship between the three leading ladies.</Review>
            <Review>Sidonie is a character who literally eavesdrops on history, becoming the audience's first-person yet second-hand source for such significant events as the storming of the Bastille...</Review>
            <Review>His portrait loses some of its eerie power through the ugly twist at the film's conclusion, but she remains a fascinating enigma, and touchingly human.</Review>
            <Review>Like the Americans, the French are infatuated with their history. They also love long close-ups of beautiful women in period costume. These elements combine in this painfully pretty period chamber piece.</Review>
            <Review>It is the life of Versailles that Jacquot captures: all the petty politics, positioning and preening. And that is simply a glorious sight to see.</Review>
            <Review>While it does not hang together as a whole, Farewell, My Queen is still an interesting and engaging film that should be overall commended for what it does achieve.</Review>

Her mother (Lili Taylor) is an alcoholic and her step-father is violent and unpredictable. One morning her boyfriend (Jonny Weston) suggests she take naked pictures for money. She balks at first but then does the photo shoot, using the money to run-off with her best friend (Dev Patel) to San Francisco. In San Francisco, while cocktailing in a strip club, Angelina meets Frances (James Franco) a well-off lawyer who offers to introduce her to a different kind of world, a place full of expensive dresses and fancy parties. But that world is not as perfect as it first appears and Frances has problems of his own. At the same time Angelina, using the moniker Cherry, has begun exploring the San Francisco porn industry under the direction of Margaret (Heather Graham) a former performer turned adult film director. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>This is just a slow-moving skin flick broken up by lots of boring discussions about Cherry's future.</Review>

            <Review>Everything here is done badly.</Review>
            <Review>It has a didactic undercurrent, making its main character into a beautiful blank, ready to blossom under the bright camera lights and to be unabashed in the face of the unenlightened.</Review>

            <Review>A sequel to a surprise but modest hit has no right to be this lackluster.</Review>
            <Review>More of the same, but what's in its favor, is Neeson's never-failing man's man toughness, which goes a long way in making for an entertaining film.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2012</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>90</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Led by the unique skills of Sarunas Marciulionis and Arvydas Sabonis, the 1992 Lithuanian Olympic basketball team helped their country break free from the shackles of Communism. After leading the USSR to a gold medal (and victory over the U.S.A.) at the '88 Seoul Olympics, Marciulionis and Sabonis were poster boys for the Soviet sports machine. Four year later, after the fall of the Soviet Union, they emerged as symbols of democracy, willing newly-independent Lithuania to the medal stand in Barcelona. The film documents the Lithuanians' experiences behind the Iron Curtain, where elite athletes were subjected to the vagaries of Communist rule. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>You don't have to give a hoot about basketball to enjoy this movie. This is a movie about identifying with, admiring and responding to achievement in any form.</Review>
            <Review>It is a dream fulfilled.</Review>
            <Review>Here's a twist on the plucky underdog sports movie. The Other Dream Team adds rock 'n' roll and eastern European history to the rah-rah mix.</Review>
            <Review>In an era when so much of the focus in sports is on the glam and the glitz, it's nice to be reminded that it can still be about heart and soul, too.</Review>
            <Review>If you root for documentaries with heart, "The Other Dream Team" is a slam dunk.</Review>
            <Review>Adding detailed historical context, the quirky feel-good story becomes a tragedy and a lesson. And that makes the victories resonate even more.</Review>
            <Review>...a deeply interesting, if conventionally structured and unflashy, documentary ... about the reassertion of national identity after generations of foreign oppression and the role of sport in nation building.</Review>
            <Review>The Other Dream Team is both an exceptional and exceptionally inspiring film.</Review>
            <Review>The Other Dream Team becomes less a simple paean to the triumph of the human spirit and more an admission of life's complexity and messiness.</Review>
            <Review>The Other Dream Team wasn't the 1992 Lithuanian Basketball movie that I necessarily wanted, but it could absolutely be the 1992 Lithuanian Basketball movie that you want, assuming you want such a thing.</Review>
            <Review>Shows sports can have other goals besides winning.</Review>
            <Review>"The Other Dream Team" is a saga of hope, courage and overcoming adversity and how a sport and its players helped a nation rekindle its voice and place on the world stage.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Inspired by events that took place in Massachusetts, Delphine and Muriel Coulin's provocative debut focuses on a group of bored teenage girls who all make an irrevocable pact. When Camille (Louise Grinberg) accidentally becomes pregnant, she encourages her friends and fellow high school classmates to follow suit. It's only a matter of time, before 17 girls in the high school are pregnant and the town is thrown into a world of chaos. Set in the writer/directors' small, seaside hometown of Lorient in Brittany, 17 Girls is a reflection on adolescence, body image, friendship and the perplexing realities of growing up. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>17 Girls is allegedly inspired by true events, but this diffident, dreamy film is so insubstantial it's hard to believe there's a speck of reality to be found in it.</Review>
            <Review>The film suggests a state of grace between childhood and adulthood, but the narrative feels increasingly tentative, and the characters remain opaque - "local divas," in one teacher's estimation.</Review>
            <Review>The question is why this incident seemed worth dramatizing, especially in such a dreamily romanti-cized way - with perfect pregnancies and friendly baby daddies.</Review>
            <Review>The movie takes you inside the dreamy collective mentality of bored, mildly rebellious girls who look with horror at the lives of their mostly working-class parents.</Review>
            <Review>The movie needs a tighter grip, yet the narrative detours, including a beach party and one especially liberating confrontation, can be surprisingly joyous.</Review>
            <Review>The film's rhythms mimic the volatile emotional life of adolescence: the violent rushes between euphoria and despair, the overconfident contempt for adults mixed with regressive dependence when things fall apart.</Review>
            <Review>The Coulin sisters spin a web of ironic, double-edged fantasy over the girls of Lorient and their child's-eye view of life.</Review>
            <Review>The wonder of this remarkable film is that it retains an innocence of its own, even while alluding to the darkness on the horizon.</Review>
            <Review>Exceedingly well-done film, based on a real news story, which addresses a growing international youth dilemma.</Review>
            <Review>It's a subtle cautionary tale that also serves as an insightful if exaggerated examination of contemporary adolescence.</Review>
            <Review>At which point does a superficially "nonjudgmental" approach simply seem coy rather than sincerely evenhanded?</Review>
            <Review>The story is remarkable in that it does an honest telling of real life events and does it accurately, too.</Review>

In the family garage sits an unfinished Soap Box Derby car, originally intended as a gift from dad. The loss of the father leaves a huge hole in Trey's life, but he soon meets Roy Gibbs (Bernsen), a local fire chief still haunted by the loss of his son on 9/11.

        <ReleaseDate> 1949</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>94</Duration>
        <StoryLine>The Dore Schary regime at MGM brought a much-needed dose of stark realism to the venerable studio. Van Johnson sheds his boy-next-door image to play L.A. plainclothes lieutenant Mike Conovan. Determined to bring a cop killer to justice, Conovan will let no man stand in his way -- not even his level-headed superiors. The detective's single-purposed pursuit causes a rift in his marriage to wife Gloria (Arlene Dahl). The film comes very close to the Dragnet school of unadorned, unglamorized police procedure: it adheres to standard MGM formula only in the final reconciliation scene. Officially a Harry Rapf production, Scene of the Crime was completed by another producer when Rapf died during filming.</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>One angry girlfriend sends three slackers on a wild ride in this over-the-top comedy from director Dome Karukoski. Janne (Jussi Vatanen) lives in a small town in Northern Finland, where jobs are scarce, there isn't much to do and he isn't about to start worrying about such things. Janne spends his abundant free time napping, playing video games and boozing with his similarly un-ambitious pals Raiha (Timo Lavikainen) and Kapo (Jasper Paakkonen), but several weeks after Janne's girlfriend Inari (Pamela Tola) gave him money to buy a new digital conversion box for their television, she discovers he spent the money on alcohol and decides she's had enough. Inari gives Janne an ultimatum -- either he produces a new converter box by morning or he's out of the house and out of her life. Janne sets out on a snowy, bitterly cold night with Raiha and Kapo to find the gadget, and over the course of a long, strange night they cross paths with a band of angry female water polo champions, some Russians trying to chop up a reindeer, vengeful taxi drivers, a sudden snowstorm and other obstacles. Meanwhile, word of Janne's troubles has gotten back to Mikko (Kari Ketonen), Inari's wealthy former boyfriend who sees an opportunity to get back in her good graces. Napapiirin Sankarit (aka Lapland Odyssey) received its North American premiere at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>"Whores' Glory" takes a deadpan, nonjudgmental approach, which generally works well, even if the fly-on-the-wall technique makes clear that what attracts flies usually stinks.</Review>
            <Review>Glawogger has the good sense mostly to stay out of the way and let the material speak for itself.</Review>
            <Review>To experience it is to be haunted by the bleakness and ugliness of prostitution, the hopeless trap of it, and the defeat of love that it represents.</Review>
            <Review>A daring, novelistic and unforgettable account of the real lives of female prostitutes in three very different countries and social contexts.</Review>
            <Review>Austrian documentarian Michael Glawogger takes his cameras to three red-light districts around the world, and finds life is miserable for the women who work in the world's oldest profession - and for the men who pay cash for sex.</Review>
            <Review>[A] quietly powerful but dispiriting documentary, which compares the world's oldest profession as practiced from place to place.</Review>
            <Review>For a film with such fraught subject matter, Whores' Glory feels ultimately empty. Whether or not that's the ultimate comment on these lives is unclear.</Review>
            <Review>Glawogger works hard at being objective and dispassionate and unsentimental, but he's clearly on the side of the working girls, and horrified by their salivating johns.</Review>
            <Review>The hopelessness of (the prostitute's) situation sometimes infests Glawogger's film, making it all seem pointlessly depressing at times, but it is a powerful work nevertheless.</Review>

            <Review>Whatever qualms there may be, it's never less than compelling: entirely atmospheric, vulgar, and boundary bursting.</Review>

            <Review>Chicago indie Stephen Cone took a quantum leap forward with this moving 2011 drama about a Christian youth group in small-town South Carolina.</Review>
            <Review>"The Wise Kids" is a guileless exploration of the growing pains of sheltered innocents whose reticence and sincerity evoke 1950s small-town values.</Review>
            <Review>[Flaws are] ultimately overshadowed by Cone's excellent young actors, particularly Torem, burrowing deeply into her character's zealotry and anguish about being left behind.</Review>
            <Review>Cone's feature is among the best of a recent spate of dramas observing American Christian life.</Review>
            <Review>Honest, observant, and subtle.</Review>
            <Review>Religion may permeate this film, but it does so because it permeates the characters' lives. "The Wise Kids" features some nice surprises and some solid acting and editing.</Review>
            <Review>Wonderfully intelligent coming-of-age story, filled with resonant questions of faith and done with a rare subtlety which honors the audience.</Review>
            <Review>Hovering over the narrative is the fear of the domino effect that change can enact, the dread that one person's "queerness" may perhaps expose everyone else's.</Review>
            <Review>A smart, generous and believable coming-of-age feature; even the comedy is the comedy of recognition, rather than belittlement.</Review>

            <Review>Shockingly uneventful, this horror film marks time until dropping its big, dumb reveal.</Review>
            <Review>A choppily edited, poorly timed mess with little continuity, overloaded with aural shocks in a desperate attempt to compensate for its minimal suspense.</Review>
            <Review>Tonderai steers the story cleanly around its queasy hairpin turns, perversely toying with one of pop cinema's most cherished clichés: the audience's inculcated desire to side with the underdog.</Review>
            <Review>There are one or two clever plot twists that are subsequently followed up by a cavalcade of ridiculous, credibility-stretching ones.</Review>
            <Review>What could be so bad about a new Jennifer Lawrence movie that its distributor opts to keep it away from critics and release it with minimal ad support? Please, allow "House at the End of the Street" to answer that question.</Review>
            <Review>This is the rare horror film so bad you almost wish it had turned into a good old connect-the-gory-dots slasher movie. The only mystery at work is how Lawrence's agent ever let her sign on.</Review>
            <Review>"House at the End of the Street" is so thoroughly unpredictable that it will even have you actively rooting for the villain and against the victims at one point.</Review>
            <Review>A "sleepover night" horror movie made for young people who haven't seen many good horror movies.</Review>
            <Review>An uncommonly tedious effort...</Review>
            <Review>It's made for - and presumably by - people who haven't ever seen a horror movie. What's even more frustrating is that its inherent ineptitude doesn't ever become entertaining in a "this is hilariously horrible" fashion.</Review>
            <Review>Ninety minutes of melodrama for ten minutes of a very derivative surprise ending.</Review>
            <Review>A clunky, run-of-the-mill horror flick written by the same guy who penned last year's similarly themed disappointment, Dream House.</Review>

        <Duration>87</Duration>
        <StoryLine>In Music from the Big House, Rita Chiarelli, Canada's Queen of the Blues, takes a pilgrimage to the birthplace of the blues, Louisiana State Maximum Security Penitentiary a.k.a Angola Prison - what used to be the bloodiest prison in America. Rita's trip turns into a historic jailhouse performance - playing with inmates serving life sentences. Their shared bond of music, and Chiarelli's vivacious personality, draw striking revelations from the inmates. Rather than sensational stories of convicts, we witness remarkable voices of hope as their love of music radiates humanity and redemption on their quest for forgiveness. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>Even with a gripping subject like blues-singing convicts, the documentary "Music from the Big House" has a disconcerting emotional distance.</Review>
            <Review>Don't look for Elvis in this stark musical doc set in a maximum security prison.</Review>
            <Review>[It] gets across a general notion of music as universal solace. But the filmmakers hesitate at going deeper into the dark places of the prisoners' biographies and the storied prison itself.</Review>
            <Review>It finally feels too cautious, as if digging a little deeper might compromise the prevailing tone of tentative uplift.</Review>
            <Review>McDonald's film ultimately boils down to being just another competent but slightly dull prison doc, albeit a toe-tapping one.</Review>
            <Review>The performances are fun, if musically only adequate -- there are no evident virtuosi languishing within Angola's walls -- and Chiarelli's attempts to frame matters philosophically fall a little flat.</Review>
            <Review>The philosophical and therapeutic value of Chiarelli's mission remains intact, but the moment Music from the Big House reveals its manipulation, it immediately deflates.</Review>
            <Review>How do we reconcile the horror of their crimes with the humanity of their music? "Big House" could have gone much deeper in tackling this question, but it does open the door.</Review>
            <Review>Music from the Big House middles along as a formless, touristy showcase for Chiarelli.</Review>
            <Review>This is utterly sincere, and there is lasting value in getting violent men to turn their energies to peaceful expression: "When you're singing, you're not angry," Chiarelli says.</Review>

            <Review>Burton's best film since 1994's Ed Wood or even 1990's Edward Scissorhands.</Review>
            <Review>This is a Tim Burton film with something to say. And that's a rare and precious thing.</Review>
            <Review>The stop-motion animation - a favorite tool of Burton's - is given loving attention, and the character design is full of terrific touches, such as the hulking flat-topped schoolmate who looks a bit like a certain man-made monster.</Review>
            <Review>The best thing about an animated monster movie with this much heart is: It's alive. In the best possible way.</Review>
            <Review>This 3-D, black-and-white "family" comedy is the year's most inventive, endearing animated feature.</Review>
            <Review>As Tim Burton films go, "Frankenweenie" is as visually keyed-in as any.</Review>
            <Review>A welcome return to form for the brilliant, inconsistent Tim Burton.</Review>
            <Review>Very much the work of an older man revisiting the obsessions of his youth, struggling at times to reconnect with them.</Review>
            <Review>Don't be surprised if everyone you know under the age of 13 declares this their new favorite Halloween film.</Review>
            <Review>It ranks among Burton's most personal films, encompassing familiar themes of loneliness, isolation and an insatiable need for love and acceptance.</Review>
            <Review>... a padded short story that didn't require embellishment... looks very weak directly compared to the sheer brilliance of the similarly themed ParaNorman.</Review>

            <Review>As a thriller, it is cack-handed and boring, and as a drama it is badly acted and utterly incurious about what it was really like to be one of the soldiers who took part - relying abjectly on cliches.</Review>

        <Title>Haight Ashbury: The Beat of a Generation</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>58</Duration>
        <StoryLine>In a brief four year span in the late 1960s, in a quaint San Francisco neighborhood less than a mile square, a creative movement emerged that would forever change a musical genre. What would come to be coined "The San Francisco Sound" served as the basis for a counter-culture revolution that would forever challenge the perception of the American ideal. This movement climaxed in a single California season known as the Summer of Love. The Beat of a Generation is a two hour documentary revealing as never before told the parallel stories of this magical "summer" that brought us the ground-breaking music known as the San Francisco Sound and the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood that provided the canvas for this artistic burst of imagination. The documentary unfolds through extensive archival footage and interviews with those who lived in the Haight during the Summer of Love, as well as those who live there now. The story comes alive through the exclusive collection of famed photojournalist Don Aters and the narration of actor Peter Coyote both former denizens of the Haight. And then there's the music. To understand the Summer of Love, as told by those who lived in the Haight, is to see it not only as a movement, but as a grand social experiment. Artists of varied disciplines and like minds made the Haight a neighborhood-wide collective of creative and social freedom. This documentary explores how the communal environment of a neighborhood informed the musical vision of an art form. The San Francisco Sound that the counter-culture marched to shouldn't be measured merely in terms of a change in creative direction. Yes, the Sound charted a radically new musical course. But, it went beyond the song sheet, beyond the recording studio and the concert hall. The San Francisco Sound took to the streets. It was freedom and it was love. It was a way of life. Haight-Ashbury: The Beat of a Generation will guide viewers into the world of the Haight as never before told on film, reminding us that change can come from any city or town, from any neighborhood or intersection; as long as the people yearn for change... and want a hell of a soundtrack to go along with it.</StoryLine>

        <Duration>103</Duration>
        <StoryLine>During the Three Kingdoms period, Cao Cao stands as the last pillar of power preventing the collapse of the Han throne. Emperor Xian, who sits on that throne, cares more about music and poems than his own power. But behind the Emperor's disinterest, rumors that Cao Cao wants the throne for himself have driven Emperor Xian to plot Cao Cao's assassination, a plan that's been years in the making. An ancient prophecy states that when the four elemental stars align, a new dynasty will arise, and in 221 A.D., they do. With the weakened government and impending omen, Cao Cao has enemies everywhere, and they all want him dead. Someone has been abducting the children of Cao Cao's dead enemies and training them to be assassins. In 221, they are grown, and sent to infiltrate Bronze Sparrow Tower. When the four stars align over Bronze Sparrow Tower, the struggle for Cao Cao's life begins.</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>Excuse Me For Living is the story of Dan Topler (Pelphrey), a rich, smart, suicidal twenty-something who dropped out of medical school to pursue his own drug habit. Well provided for and a bit coddled, he refuses to grow up or get happy. After a suicide attempt on the George Washington Bridge lands him in an upscale rehabilitation clinic, Dr. Jacob Bernstein (Vaughn) takes him under his wing. The doctor issues these commands: obey the no-drugs rules, and join the geriatric temple men's group he leads-or face incarceration. Meanwhile, Dan's prep school friends continue to lure Dan to bacchanals. Dan's addiction and tired mind can't resist the drugs, booze, and women, until he becomes smitten with Laura (Archer), Dr. Bernstein's daughter. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>A catchy but irrelevant title is the first of many problems with Excuse Me for Living, which throws together a lot of superficially flashy elements that never gel in any organic way.</Review>
            <Review>Like Lloyd, who plays the clinic's leading loon, "Excuse Me" is much more about making fun than making sense.</Review>
            <Review>Is it a comedy if the audience laughs or is it a comedy if laughs were intended, irrespective of whether they're generated? "Excuse Me for Living" qualifies under the second definition.</Review>
            <Review>Vaguely misogynistic and defiantly paternalistic, the movie fails at nearly everything - comic tone, sex gags, charm, logic, direction of actors ...</Review>
            <Review>A lumbering mess in which [Klass] has somehow trapped several recognizable actors.</Review>
            <Review>Atrocious dreck that feels sitcomish, only without the polish or panache.</Review>
            <Review>No strand of Excuse Me for Living's frantic, unfunny, and pseudo-thoughtful narrative is well conceived.</Review>

            <Review>A riveting, horrifying film, shot through with beautifully observed moments of unwelcome truth.</Review>
            <Review>Compliance is one of the toughest sits of the movie year 2012. But it's an uncompromising and, in its way, honorable drama built upon a prank call that goes on and on, getting worse and worse for the people on the other end of the line.</Review>
            <Review>The point of Compliance, which caused walkouts and shouting matches when it premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, is how we are programmed to do things that go against our natural instincts as long as we believe we have the law on our side.</Review>
            <Review>There's the adage that life is nasty, brutish and short. It's even worse when you're half-naked and locked in a supply room with your boss.</Review>
            <Review>This is one insistent film, more evocative of human behavior than movies that take fewer risks ever could be.</Review>
            <Review>Like a John Hughes movie hijacked by Roman Polanski, this troubling indie effort lays bare the sadomasochism of the American workplace.</Review>
            <Review>Dark, disturbing, confrontational stuff. Also a damn good film.</Review>
            <Review>Compliance is diminutively sufficient and blandly adequate with no additional layers that elevate its small independent nature. It feels rather one note riding on the promise of a distinctive tale that never totally comes to fulfillment.</Review>
            <Review>A frightening look at the power of authority and the human desire to avoid conflict.</Review>
            <Review>It never loses sight of its goal to persuade us to be more aware, more questioning of our leaders and institutions, from politicians to priests to, in this case, the police.</Review>
            <Review>The only film of 2012 that had me actively booing its villain - a mundane monster who doesn't need to touch his victims to scar them for life.</Review>
            <Review>Compliance is a horror movie with no sudden frights, no gore, and not a single scream. It's a surveillance video, capturing us with all our blemishes; a reminder that how we see ourselves is so rarely in line with the truth</Review>

            <Review>Try as the filmmakers might, it just isn't the same. How could it be, really?</Review>
            <Review>Actress Moore makes one actually feel sorry for Sarah Palin at points in this wonderful film.</Review>
            <Review>The dramatic re-creations are somewhat uneven: The convention staging is quite convincing, the campaign trail less so.</Review>
            <Review>The constant use of actual news footage adds a bit of verisimilitude but also constantly raises the question of why this lightly fictionalized version of the election actually needs to exist.</Review>
            <Review>Game Change, which explores how smart people make dumb decisions, is a movie for all of us.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is more balanced than I expected.</Review>
            <Review>It's a comedy, for at least 30% of its running time, leaving the rest a condensed, perplexing vision of Washington ambition and insistent ego, leaving the movie somewhere between a cartoon and a mean-spirited prank.</Review>
            <Review>The reality is that HBO's Game Change makes a bad showing by arming game and gifted players with a weak and labored script.</Review>
            <Review>Game Change is not one-sided, exactly. It is, instead, uneven and episodic.</Review>
            <Review>It plausibly lays out Palin's path from unsteady candidate to confident (or arrogant) rogue player.</Review>
            <Review>That it works is testament to an astounding, Emmy-worthy performance by Moore, who plays Palin with nuance, and without a trace of parody.</Review>

The FBI and his old cohorts believe that he hid the loot from the last heist 8 years ago, $10 Million in Bonds. To get his hands on it, his old partner Vincent kidnaps Allison and demands the entire $ 10 Million as ransom. Montgomery only has one day to get the $10 Million ransom but much to the disbelief of the FBI on his trail and Vincent, Will doesn't actually have it.

            <Review>Stolen begins at overdetermined, makes a pit stop at outright sadistic and winds up in the parking garage of ridiculous even for a movie of this sort.</Review>
            <Review>The deep-rooted silliness makes it hard to take anything in the film seriously. But at least it has the decency never to ask us to.</Review>
            <Review>In Stolen, [Cage] steals away with nothing; he's simply stalled out.</Review>
            <Review>Cage is uncharacteristically muted. He seems to have given up on making art long ago; these days, all he wants to do is entertain, and with Stolen, he succeeds, albeit only on the guilty-pleasure level.</Review>
            <Review>Stolen knows what type of movie it is and has resolutely low-ambitions, but it succeeds on its own terms as a fast, fun, B-grade piece of junk.</Review>
            <Review>a diverting but predictable action movie.</Review>
            <Review>By turns hilarious, absurd, offensive, and insulting, this is all rote action that will pique your interest only when it is being completely ridiculous.</Review>
            <Review>Cage works up a sweat dashing about New Orleans... but the film's thrills and spills are all too routine</Review>
            <Review>The hammy criminal leads chew the scenery, with only Huston delivering a remotely convincing performance.</Review>
            <Review>The film ends up being devoid of tension. They probably should have kept the bunny in the box.</Review>

            <Review>Hit &amp; Run isn't always a smooth ride, but the quirks and misfires make it as distinctive as the actor behind many of the film's creative choices.</Review>
            <Review>Hit &amp; Run may stall early and often, but the Bell/Shepard screen chemistry serves as a nitrous boost.</Review>

            <Review>Surprisingly harsh when it comes to the dented appeal of its lead character, the movie is a predictable drag, attempting to cozy up to its young adult literary origins in a decidedly tuneless fashion.</Review>
            <Review>There's nothing like a terminal illness for firing up a sappy romantic drama.</Review>
            <Review>This latest directorial outing by Ol Parker has a veneer of cancer but it's the wish-fulfilment teenage romance at its heart that is most likely to appeal to its target audience.</Review>
            <Review>The problem isn't so much that Now Is Good will reduce its teenage target audience to public sniveling, but that it does so by pushing the most obvious and most sentimental buttons repeatedly, relentlessly and somewhat extravagantly.</Review>
            <Review>Fanning gives a truly impressive and memorable performance in this ... which will give Parker another dark horse in the running.</Review>
            <Review>Preteen girls will find this soppy romance unbearably romantic, but everyone else will struggle to sit through it</Review>
            <Review>Is Now Is Good a great film? Almost certainly not. But its effectiveness is frightening. Bring whole sheaves of tissues.</Review>
            <Review>Why is [Dakota Fanning] living onscreen the way that so few female protagonists get to live? Because she's dying. *sigh*</Review>
            <Review>I'm sorry to say, that despite Dakota Fanning's powerful dying performance, Now Is Good - is not a good movie. Unfortunately, it looks like a 90's daytime soap and pulls at the heart strings like Michael Bolton's mullet.</Review>

            <Review>A lightweight and overlong feel-good drama that plays like a mashup of It's a Wonderful Life and Friday Night Lights.</Review>
            <Review>Are any of them alone reason enough to sit through two hours of warmed-over life lessons? Not particularly, but it should be said that the cast and crew have made a fair stride towards redeeming earnest low-budget filmmaking of this ilk...</Review>
            <Review>If George Bailey had been a high school football hero, It's a Wonderful Life might have been a little like Touchback.</Review>
            <Review>Touchback takes a handoff from Peggy Sue Got Married and It's A Wonderful Life and runs it up the middle for a modest gain.</Review>
            <Review>Touchback is a sweet family film that ultimately lacks enough insight into the main character's thought process as he struggles to make a decision that could change his life.</Review>
            <Review>[I]t's not a bad film. It just needed a little trimming and a little work on the ending.</Review>
            <Review>Touchback isn't a bad movie, aside from the makeup effects that look like someone just shoved a pillow down Bryan Presley's shirt. It's just an unconvincing one.</Review>

            <Review>While the movie itself is an uneven, sometimes preachy affair, it's alive with possibilities whenever [Weston's] on screen.</Review>
            <Review>Initially, this low-budget film writes a lot of checks on the First National Bank of Whimsy, but I was astonished when none of them bounced.</Review>
            <Review>A likably goofy, lo-fi indie propelled by the syncopations of a cheesy keyboard - and the cheesy dreams of its hapless heroes.</Review>
            <Review>Inner child? Open road? No, this film is actually about Mr. O'Nan and his wan, scruffy innocence.</Review>
            <Review>An indie about-tell me if this sounds familiar-a brokenhearted sad sack who travels cross-country with a weirdo and a too-hot-for-these-dorks woman on a road trip of healing and self-actualization.</Review>
            <Review>Offering little more than flat karaoke versions of Sundance-style hits, this is strictly an amateur-hour affair.</Review>
            <Review>An offbeat, hipster-inflected road movie that steadfastly refuses to conform to expectation and sense. A to-scale victory of quirky charm and feeling over sagacity.</Review>
            <Review>O'Nan deciphers in comical yet solemn ways, young characters representing warring sides of himself. While doing battle with joblessness, alienation, working stiff drudgery, and existential redemption through art and the imagination.</Review>

It's hard being a hit man; at least that's Raph's take on the situation. Especially when he finds himself in hot water for forgetting his son's ninth birthday. Luckily Max is there to help his friend scramble to get things together for the kid's big day. But when Sam sends the duo on a last-minute job, the two friends find themselves locked in a laboratory with a team of terrified researchers. It's a classic tale of science gone awry, zombie alien style. And it's up to our heroes to save the day - and try not to become zalien drones in the process! But the trouble they've gotten themselves into is nothing compared to the wrath of Raph's wife if he doesn't make it home in time for his son's birthday party.

            <Review>It feels like each and every moment bursts forth with urgent dialogue, and yet what does anyone actually say?</Review>
            <Review>There's not really a movie there, nothing that sustains itself from scene to scene and nothing that's worth watching from beginning to end.</Review>
            <Review>The film is all too faithful to its un-cinematic source.</Review>
            <Review>"Cosmopolis," because of its allegiance to the book's mannered, offbeat language, feels like it never wakes up.</Review>
            <Review>Poor Pattinson does the best he can. He's not terrible. But he's definitely out of his element, if not beyond his depth, an altar boy in a bishop's robes.</Review>
            <Review>Quickly grows repetitive and tiresome, meandering toward messages that land softly, producing little impact.</Review>
            <Review>Cronenberg is not a director to be daunted by a scenario in which the antihero spends most of his time in a stretch limo. Turning it into a film that interests anyone ... is another matter</Review>
            <Review>Cronenberg's cold, exacting precision and emotionally removed observation may not grab all viewers, but under those perfect surfaces is a raw horror trying to claw out of the denial.</Review>
            <Review>Over and above its topical urgency or the bit about the misfortune of globalism, it does what this director has always done in his films: split open the head of a character, plunge inside and try to visualise the bad and the ugly things to be found there.</Review>
            <Review>"Cosmopolis" is a hypnotic examination of our modern anxieties about the dehumanization brought on by wealth, power, and technology.</Review>
            <Review>While not one of Cronenberg's stronger films, this anti-capitalist adaptation still merits attention.</Review>

        <StoryLine>The Trouble with Bliss tells the story of 35-year-old Morris Bliss (Michael C. Hall), who is clamped firmly in the jaws of New York City inertia. He wants to travel but has no money; he needs a job but has no prospects; and he still shares an apartment with his widowed father (Peter Fonda), who treats Morris with a mix of disdain and exasperation. When he finds himself juggling a bizarre relationship with the sexually precocious 18-year-old daughter (Brie Larson) of a former classmate and the advances of his very forward neighbor (Lucy Liu), Morris realizes that even though his life is unraveling, it's also opening up in ways that are long overdue. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>Hall does what he can, but Michael Knowles' film does such a thorough job portraying the ennui and aimlessness gripping its protagonist that the feeling is contagious.</Review>
            <Review>The difficulties of adapting idiosyncratic literature to the screen are all too apparent in The Trouble With Bliss.</Review>
            <Review>Striving mightily to be the indie equivalent of a wacky sitcom, "The Trouble With Bliss" fails to draw much humor from farcical situations.</Review>
            <Review>The kind of movie that gives a bad name to the concept of "quirky."</Review>
            <Review>Without much actual character to latch on to, most of the actors seem lost and awkward, even the usually dependable Hall.</Review>
            <Review>Knowles and Light indulge in so many indie clichés, their movie could be used as a film-school case study.</Review>
            <Review>The Trouble With Bliss intriguingly showcases the numerous struggles people face as they reflect on their life paths.</Review>
            <Review>Packs a lot of Lower East Side quirkiness into 97 minutes. Maybe too much.</Review>
            <Review>Less than the comic sum of its sardonic parts "The Trouble With Bliss" is a triviality.</Review>
            <Review>The trouble with Bliss isn't that he's lazy... it's that he's boring.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Will Hay plays Benjamin Stubbins, an unsuccessful and incompetent English lawyer with a tendency to tip the bottle and an inability to pay any of the considerable debts he has managed to accumulate. His wealthy family, of course, disapproves of him and has taken custody of his daughter so that she will receive a proper upbringing. Stubbins does not improve matters by visiting his brother-in-law and accidentally getting the butler drunk when he recommends alcohol as the cure for his toothache. He gets no more respect at the office, where lazy office boy Willie ignores his instructions in favor of reading the comics. Stubbins' life changes, however, when a gang of American crooks shows up. They know that the safe to a bank is located directly underneath his office and they employ the unsuspecting solicitor to track down a family tree, thus keeping him out of the office while they stage a robbery. Later, they show up at Stubbins' brother-in-law's house during a Christmas party, planning to fleece the host and his guests. Fortunately, Stubbins also shows up, disguised as Santa, and after the usual chase, the gang is captured.</StoryLine>

            <Review>I found myself dreaming of the days when Willis would take a rest from Die Hard-ing to do character cameos of unexpected depth and pathos: Pulp Fiction, Nobody's Fool, and a few others. Now he clings to stoic longevity, and shoots people.</Review>
            <Review>Yes, it's a B movie sci-fi thriller, but not many prestige pictures have this much going on underneath the surface.</Review>
            <Review>That first hour cooks. And the second hour brings Emily Blunt into the story, which is a fine thing for any second half to offer.</Review>
            <Review>If the whole thing leaves you rubbing your temples, just a bit... well, this headache's sort of worth it.</Review>
            <Review>The reasoning behind all this may not reward prolonged inspection, but Johnson is smart enough to press onward with his plot, leaving us with neither the time nor the desire to linger over the logic ...</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director Rian Johnson establishes himself as an original talent who clearly believes storytelling must prevail.</Review>
            <Review>Great set-up. Awful follow-through.</Review>
            <Review>While the film overshoots its landing by a mile, it's a worthwhile science fiction piece with no shortage of interesting ideas.</Review>
            <Review>Rian Johnson is a very clever man, if sometimes a bit too clever for his own good.</Review>
            <Review>This is the real deal, folks - intelligent, humorous, exciting entertainment that happens to be sci-fi but is by no means limited to that genre's target audience in terms of appeal.</Review>
            <Review>This is a wildly entertaining film that isn't content with science and cinematic tricks. It desires, and achieves, much more.</Review>

            <Review>Though the plotting is problematic and at times as lost as the kids, there are bursts of brilliance and moments of aching vulnerability in "Little Birds" that make you wonder what the filmmaker might do next.</Review>
            <Review>The dreamy shots of a poisoned sea in "Little Birds" show an imagination sorely missing from its drab plot and characters.</Review>
            <Review>Despair may be an emotion of emptiness, of the absence of hope, but that doesn't mean a movie about someone spiraling down into that emotion has to feel so empty as well.</Review>
            <Review>There's a moralistic structure there, but it leaves Lily in a place that's scarcely more reassuring than the one she first abandoned. That's what makes Little Birds not just a lesson but, in its rambling way, an organic journey.</Review>
            <Review>Like its teenage heroine, "Little Birds" is stubbornly convinced of its own unique profundity. So it's a good thing this moodily self-absorbed drama redeems itself with just enough endearing innocence.</Review>
            <Review>It is hard not to be reminded of other movies - like Larry Clark's "Kids," Nick Cassavetes's "Alpha Dog," Andrea Arnold's "Fish Tank" - that explore similar territory with greater risk and originality.</Review>
            <Review>There have been a bunch of films about teen girls with a wild streak getting in over their heads, and Little Birds isn't all that different, though it does have a bit more of a sense that this is the teen feeling it, not the adult looking back.</Review>
            <Review>Quirky tale of female empowerment about coming of age on L.A.'s mean streets.</Review>
            <Review>Fragile tale of how a lifelong friendship forged between two innocent girls is tested when they venture into a volatile, violent world.</Review>
            <Review>Teen girls seek respite from bleak life in mature drama.</Review>
            <Review>Coming-of-age, semi-autobiographical drama has flashes of adventure and danger, but too much 'So what?'.</Review>
            <Review>Temple, in particular, is headed for stardom.</Review>

After taking Francis hostage in a test of his powers, however, they quickly free him, and offer sanctuary to the fugitive family.

            <Review>This isn't quite the human drama Pedersen might wish, but it's compelling enough, and more important, it gives us a look at conservative Russian politics at their most ruthless and vindictive.</Review>
            <Review>What makes Putin's Kiss interesting goes beyond Masha's personal rise and fall. For starters, it offers a fresh glimpse into how Putin's Russia actually works.</Review>
            <Review>"Putin's Kiss'' is more than just the portrait of a naive young woman. It's a frightening look at Putin's warped version of democracy.</Review>
            <Review>A portentous, rather creepy documentary that masks its lack of historical context with an atmosphere of accumulating threat.</Review>
            <Review>While it comes across as simplistic, it's also achingly wistful about political awakenings being just a matter of talking to and finding empathy for the other side.</Review>
            <Review>Though Masha's courage is considerable, her change of heart finally feels too nuanced for Pedersen's streamlined political-drama treatment...</Review>
            <Review>Often fascinating and provocative.</Review>
            <Review>There are complex machinations at work here - but there's always a sense of the surface being skimmed in favour of telling Drokova's story.</Review>

        <StoryLine>An untold chapter in the Mass Effect saga, following the early career of Alliance Marine, James Vega, as he leads a squad of elite special forces into battle against a mysterious alien threat known as The Collectors. Stationed at a colony in a remote star system, Vega and his troops must protect the inhabitants from an invasion of the deadly insectoid warriors determined to collect the population for unknown purposes. Soon after the attack, Vega's commanding officer falls in battle, forcing the young officer to embrace the responsibility of leadership for the colony's survival. Having idolized Earth's greatest hero and warrior, Commander Shepard (the central character in the Mass Effect video games), the young and idealistic Vega must now make life and the death decisions that will effect not only the lives of his squad, but the lives of every person in the colony - all of whom he has sworn to protect. Fighting valiantly for every life in his hands, Vega soon discovers the path of heroism is not as glamorous as he envisioned, and that victory in war always comes with a heavy price; the end of innocence, the sacrifice of one's ideals and ultimately, the loss of those closest to him.</StoryLine>

            <Review>A dumb film, but mildly entertaining if your standards are low enough to rent something called In the Name of the King 2: Two Worlds in the first place.</Review>
            <Review>What's not to love about a movie that features time-traveling ninjas, a CGI dragon and a scene where Dolph Lundgren literally asks the king what his name is. Genius!</Review>
            <Review>After starring in The Expendables, was Dolph Lundgren really strapped enough for cash to star in this?</Review>

        <Duration>86</Duration>
        <StoryLine>A couple whose relationship is in trouble must decide if tragedy will bring them together or tear them apart in this independent drama. Michael Hade (Andrew Ramaglia) is a fisherman living and working in the Pacific Northwest with his wife Sara (Emily Cline) and their young son Jack (P.J. Caniff). Michael has been having a hard time getting work and he's developed a serious drinking problem, while Sara, who is studying to become a nurse, is becoming increasingly frustrated with their relationship and has been spending time with one of her former boyfriends. Michael and Sara have both been paying less attention to Jack, and their relationship hits bottom after the boy dies in a drowning incident in the bathtub. As Michael confronts Sarah about cheating on him and she in turns demands he quits drinking, the pain of their loss only makes their accusations all the more hurtful, and they must decide if they have any reason to stay together. Morning was the first feature film from writer and director Joe Mitacek; the film received its world premiere at the 2010 Seattle International Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>Chicago-based writer/director Ron Lazzeretti (The Opera Lover, The Merry Gentleman) explores the complexities of modern relationships in this independent drama presented in four parts. The first segment, titled "Last Day" finds acrimony taking precedent over amenity during a farewell party for an employee who's about to move on. A bride and the priest who's officiating her wedding get an unpleasant surprise after running away together in "Wedding Night," and a woman on the CTA receives a spontaneous gift that transforms her outlook on the world (at least, momentarily) in "Flowers". Lastly, a family preparing for a big relocation finds the forces of the universe seemingly aligned against them in "Move".</StoryLine>

        <Duration>105</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Twenty-five years after rising to international acclaim in Jean de Florette and Manon of the Spring, Daniel Auteuil returns to the world of Marcel Pagnol for his first work as director with this celebrated remake of the 1940s classic. Auteuil stars as the eponymous well-digger Pascale, a widower living with his six daughters in the Provence countryside at the start of World War I. His eldest, Patricia (the luminous Astrid Berg�s-Frisbey), has returned home from Paris to help raise her sisters, and Pascale dreams of marrying her off to his loyal assistant Felipe (Kad Merad). But when she's impregnated by a wealthy young pilot (Nicolas Duvauchelle) who promptly abandons her for the frontlines, Pascale is left to contend with the consequences. -- (C) Kino Lorber</StoryLine>

            <Review>"The Well-Digger's Daughter" isn't a mind-blower; it's not supposed to be. It's a light lunch with an old friend whom it's good to see again.</Review>
            <Review>Auteuil's direction is a lot like his acting -- well-mannered and likable, yet staid and ultimately inconsequential.</Review>
            <Review>To call "The Well Digger's Daughter" an old-fashioned film is to pay it a compliment. Here is a love story embedded in traditional values.</Review>
            <Review>"The Well-Digger's Daughter" is perhaps a bit too sentimental. But the performances are so heartfelt that its occasional excesses are easily forgiven.</Review>
            <Review>It's classical moviemaking of a sort rarely seen now, a love story of surprising joy with rounded, flawed but humane characters.</Review>
            <Review>What resonates is a sense of humanity that sometimes gets lost in films with less regard for traditional storytelling, or respect for simple emotion.</Review>
            <Review>Remake lacks the power of context</Review>
            <Review>The countryside of high Provence is a major character all its own.</Review>
            <Review>Think of it as a pretty good, French-language bucolic entry in PBS' "Masterpiece" franchise and you'll be fine.</Review>
            <Review>Strong pedigree pushes 'Well Digger's Daughter' to the top.</Review>
            <Review>The jewel at the heart of the piece is Berges-Frisbey -- the ravishing mermaid Syrena in "Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides."</Review>
            <Review>Despite a verbose script and the kneejerk sexism of Pascal, the visual beauty and narrative simplicity make the film a pleasure.</Review>

            <Review>The premise is ambitious -- if not a little hokey -- but the meager themes of ephemeral authorship and constructed realities aren't exactly revelatory.</Review>
            <Review>Bradley Cooper's funniest movie since "The Hangover" - unfortunately, unintentionally this time ...</Review>
            <Review>This film's layered storytelling lacks the fluidity, grace, or good humour, to pull off its conceit.</Review>
            <Review>Romanticized claptrap.</Review>
            <Review>"The Words" is an elegant piece of entertainment, replete with an understated but sweeping score, unexpected period piece vignettes, and melodramatic but universal themes.</Review>
            <Review>The Words is a solid drama that's anchored by one of Cooper's very best performances...</Review>
            <Review>This tedious and needlessly convoluted drama ... just meanders aimlessly.</Review>
            <Review>A movie about a bad author who steals the book of a good author, and I'm pretty certain that The Words, if pressed, wouldn't be able to tell the difference.</Review>
            <Review>It's nothing you haven't seen before in films about struggling artists spending more time obsessing than working.</Review>
            <Review>Its long, dry patches of colourless storytelling suggest it makes more sense as a book, one to read before you fall asleep to dream of better movies.</Review>

            <Review>Watching "Killer Joe" to the bitter end is like playing the Pick 6 lottery and getting three of the numbers right. You don't win anything, but you still think you're smarter than all those other idiots.</Review>
            <Review>You will either love "Killer Joe" or run away screaming. I absorbed this NC-17 nail bomb with awestruck admiration.</Review>
            <Review>[Friedkin] has retained his touch ... all these years later. And in Matthew McConaughey, he has the perfect vehicle for madness.</Review>
            <Review>You end up feeling sorry for all the actors forced to humiliate themselves, except for McConaughey, whose portrayal of sadistic, manipulative evil is mesmerizing.</Review>
            <Review>The movie frequently clicks as a sendup of over-the-top film-noir storytelling.</Review>
            <Review>I'll never look at fried chicken the same way again.</Review>
            <Review>Killer Joe is trash. Not bad trash. Not pretentious trash. Just plain old ugly, funny, and sophisticated trash.</Review>
            <Review>The tone in Killer Joe feels so expertly and delicately crafted that we only laugh at the film's absurd scenarios if and when the filmmaker permits it so.</Review>
            <Review>Violent, coarse, perverted, and sickly hilarious, this is highly recommend for those who like their entertainment on the nasty, demented tip.</Review>
            <Review>This Southern-fried, darkly humorous trailer-trash exploitation crime noir revels in the greedy characters' idiocy and the deranged story's psychosexual luridness.</Review>

            <Review>Satisfying on a basic, fun level, but also stylishly produced and not insulting to the viewer's intelligence.</Review>
            <Review>The movie, idiotic as it is, has its charms, thanks in large part to its two main actors.</Review>
            <Review>Gordon-Levitt proves he's the best actor on two wheels, pedaling furiously to save a grueling ride from becoming more tiresome.</Review>
            <Review>Joseph Gordon-Levitt' fixed-wheel bike has a single gear and no brakes, and you could say the same of director David Koepp's film, which is light on character and plot. But, even on two wheels, the action is fast and furious.</Review>

            <Review>For all its occasional tin ear, Dr Phil dialogue, its contrivances and shortcuts, this remains a fundamentally sound and solid entertainment with a deep-rooted conviction that how we treat each other matters.</Review>
            <Review>Eastwood and Adams do the best they can with the cornball sentimentality and cheesy dialogue, but first-time director Robert Lorenz merely photographs the on- and off-field action. Give it a pass.</Review>
            <Review>Lorenz ... lays in everything methodically, fully, but without much invention or energy; you can imagine each plot development ten minutes before it arrives.</Review>
            <Review>Eastwood, in his 80s, looks a lot trimmer than some of the performers in this film half his age. He may be the only octogenarian actor who has to play older than his age to be convincing.</Review>
            <Review>Nobody would pay much attention to this plodding but good-hearted film if not for its star, Clint Eastwood, although he's just dialing in the go-to Cantankerous Old Man mode on which he has relied for a decade or so.</Review>
            <Review>This isn't the worst performance Eastwood has given in his 57-year career, but it's his least inspired in about a decade.</Review>
            <Review>While 'Moneyball' made a strong case for sabermetrics being the future of baseball, 'Trouble' makes just as strong a case for tried-and-true scouting as being the foundation.</Review>
            <Review>Like a big, looping knuckleball, Clint Eastwood's new movie wanders amiably, threatens to go wild, but in the end settles smack in the middle of the plate.</Review>
            <Review>"Trouble With The Curve" is a picture of small pleasures, and a lunkheaded finale isn't enough to ruin all of the good will it earns through its first two acts.</Review>
            <Review>Doesn't just remind you what a great screen presence Clint Eastwood is; it makes you appreciate him even more as a director because Lorenz does such a terrible job.</Review>
            <Review>Long stretches of Trouble With the Curve make you wish you had other ways to occupy yourself.</Review>
            <Review>The good news is that Eastwood does his thing to perfection, Adams provides the spunky cuteness, and Timberlake couldn't scrub his eager charm off with a Brillo pad if he tried.</Review>

Having never met before, things quickly get off on the wrong foot as Bishop Enoch relentlessly attempts to convert Flik into a follower of Jesus Christ. Between his grandfather's constant preaching and the culture shock of inner-city life, Flik's summer appears to be a total disaster - until he meets Chazz Morningstar (Toni Lysaith), a pretty girl his age, who shows Flik the brighter side of Brooklyn. Through her love and the love of his grandfather, Flik begins to realize that the world is a lot bigger, and perhaps a lot better, than he'd ever imagined. -- (C) Variance</StoryLine>

            <Review>For the most part it's all rather pleasant, if somewhat aimless.</Review>
            <Review>Lee's typically paradoxical statements on race and religion muddle the narrative, and his old stylistic tricks -- saturated color schemes, characters addressing the camera -- aren't exactly inspired.</Review>
            <Review>The story is static for about 90 minutes, then rises to action, but in a way that seems impromptu, either made up on the spot or ill-considered.</Review>
            <Review>When Spike Lee fails he fails big, and he goes down in flames with "Red Hook Summer."</Review>
            <Review>Lee's latest film feels like several intriguing ideas in search of an over-arching story.</Review>
            <Review>This coming-of-age portrait provides one more instance of Lee as one of this country's finest cinematic regionalists.</Review>
            <Review>I still cannot fathom whatever point Lee's trying to make here, or why he would derail his not-bad summer idyll with such a nuclear bomb.</Review>
            <Review>"Red Hook Summer" has so much life, so much verve. Spike Lee always makes movies you want to wrestle with, even if the rewards this time around aren't as worthwhile.</Review>
            <Review>... shimmers with unfocused energy.</Review>
            <Review>You might not buy what Lee's peddling, and it certainly has its clunky moments, but you're still likely to have your consciousness raised along with those skeptical eyebrows.</Review>

            <Review>There are holes in the plot, to be sure, but somehow we don't mind, because for all the unbearable tension of Jarecki's script, the central attraction here is the man in the arena.</Review>
            <Review>A tight thriller that shows [its] handsome star in fine form as a morally bankrupt financier playing fast and loose with ethics and the law.</Review>
            <Review>Gere gets the role he has been suiting up for ever since he was first designer-dressed for a murder rap in American Gigolo.</Review>
            <Review>Part thriller, part character study, and it moves swiftly and confidently, with many details that feel exactly right.</Review>
            <Review>This isn't very effective as a thriller, though it's a provocative fable about our ambivalent feelings toward financial elites.</Review>
            <Review>The screenplay, written by first-time director Nicholas Jarecki, keeps us guessing, which is one of the best compliments one can pay to a movie of this sort.</Review>
            <Review>Does the privilege of powerful men always lead to lust and lies? No. But the phrase 'Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely,' is well depicted in 'Arbitrage.'</Review>
            <Review>Really, it could use some nip/tuck on the screenplay, but the players are decent and the movie looks opulent enough.</Review>
            <Review>Aside from Gere's performance, there's really not much to see here.</Review>
            <Review>As we follow the increasingly frantic Gere down his nightmarish rabbit hole, the picture takes a satisfyingly cold, amoral stance - less critique and more cynical observation.</Review>
            <Review>Like something straight out of 1992, Nicholas Jarecki's debut feature Arbitrage ... is a small scale, high-gloss thriller that feels like Wall Street's cousin.</Review>
            <Review>A Wall Street-thriller blending elements of Chappaquiddick with a pinch of John Edwards and a whole lot of Bernie Madoff.</Review>

        <StoryLine>During the '60s, Caucasian journalist John Howard Griffin decided to find out what it was like to be an African-American in the South, so he set out to do so by changing his appearance and going on the road. Based on the book about his experience, this screen adaptation (by director Carl Lerner and his wife Gerda) was not considered by many to be a convincing tale. The plausability of much of the story on film is questionable, including the northern accent of actor James Whitmore, and his poor makeup job--which would not seem to fool anyone. Among the distractions in this drama include the many confusing flashback sequences and illogical circumstances involving the main character. After Black Like Me, Lerner would soon return to his former profession; film editor.</StoryLine>

            <Review>"Hermano" is well-trod acreage, but there's a vitality here that's easy to appreciate.</Review>
            <Review>The sports-as-savior theme is an old one, but this confident movie, alternately volatile and tender, coats its clichés in winningly natural performances and Enrique Aular's kinetic photography.</Review>
            <Review>The over-the-top opening, which evokes baby Moses in the bulrushes, indicates grand ambitions, but unfortunately the gritty realism of Rasquin's cinematic style is just camouflage for another cliched sports flick.</Review>
            <Review>Rasquin's cinema verite style brings power to the story, and he has coaxed some good performances out of his leads.</Review>
            <Review>Scoring goals in soccer is hard. Hermano earns its points too easily.</Review>
            <Review>Hermano is part sports film, part neorealist drama and a fully successful debut feature from Venezuelan director Marcel Rasquín.</Review>
            <Review>Venezuelan filmmaker Marcel Rasquin's Hermano is a well-meaning melodrama, equal parts heartfelt and contrived.</Review>
            <Review>The story feels driven more by coincidence than authenticity, leading to an eye-rolling climax.</Review>
            <Review>An uneasy combination of good and bad, which earns a mild recommendation on the strength of the two lead performances and its success in capturing the desperate milieu of Caracas' teeming underclass.</Review>
            <Review>The overwrought story unfolds awkwardly, with one ridiculously contrived act of violence in the middle, and it piles on both sports-drama and up-from-poverty clichés.</Review>
            <Review>Rasquin and Jones avoid cliche to deliver an ending that hits home as hard as an unexpected football to the solar plexus.</Review>
            <Review>Good football action and an inside look at the Caracas barrios cannot save this film from a thin script and sport drama predictability.</Review>

            <Review>With "Dog Days" and its been-there, done-that screenplay, the franchise takes a step backward.</Review>
            <Review>With their recurring characters and suburban Anytown USA setting, these films represent a throwback to the assembly-line days of 'Andy Hardy' and 'Blondie' movies: They lack surprise but not laughs.</Review>

            <Review>An inconsequential high-school-reunion comedy that gets better when it stops trying to make you laugh.</Review>
            <Review>Linden manages to overcome what would seem to be a premise fraught with peril with a lot of help from a likable cast, making "10 Years" a surprisingly enjoyable movie.</Review>
            <Review>'10 Years' is a surprisingly solid variation on a familiar tune.</Review>
            <Review>It's easy to see how Linden attracted such a star-studded young cast. Most every character has his or her own moment, and many of them deliver lines that stick with you.</Review>
            <Review>To hate 10 Years is like hating the enthusiastic girl who organizes your high school reunion-- can you really be so mean when so much effort was made and a reasonably good time was had by all?</Review>
            <Review>Solid work...by, most notably, Lynn Collins, whose Anna is the most deeply explored character in the film.</Review>

            <Review>With a new generation of visual effects at his command, director Len Wiseman has the ability to paint on a broader canvas, but since we see this caliber of movie magic on a regular basis it's no longer an Event.</Review>
            <Review>"Total Recall" is a toned-down, smoothed-out version of an amped-up, bug-eyed classic.</Review>
            <Review>This is a taut, serviceable sci-fi thriller with a couple of neat visual ideas, and if you're not familiar with either the Schwarzenegger version or the original story, the brain-bending twists alone will take you a reasonably long way.</Review>
            <Review>Casting and visuals are an upgrade, but we get far too many action sequences and not enough of the mind games.</Review>
            <Review>I was no particular fan of the first Total Recall, but I confess that this flat, by-the-numbers remake made me a tad nostalgic for its bombastic preposterousness.</Review>
            <Review>The very fast, very loud, very dynamic, very cartoony-violent 'Total Recall' remake will make you feel like you've been hit in the face with a brick for two hours.</Review>
            <Review>Bland all the way through, from dialogue to action and everything in between. It's not a missed opportunity - just a total waste of time.</Review>
            <Review>Beckinsale is the only cast member who comes out rosey here, and frankly I wouldn't mind a spin off movie about her character.</Review>
            <Review>A generic, inconsequential sci-fi caper that looks slick and has a famous title, and offers little else, no matter how many nipples the whores have.</Review>
            <Review>It would rather be a blockbuster than a mind-bender. It turns out to be neither.</Review>

            <Review>The film acts as both a diary of a sidewinding comic stylist finding his style, almost by accident, and a reminder to all post-collegiate boyfriends and girlfriends that "OK" probably isn't good enough for either party.</Review>
            <Review>This is a movie for anyone who's ever been unsure, and surely that's everyone.</Review>
            <Review>Notwithstanding its storytelling stumbles, "Sleepwalk With Me" points in a positive direction for this likable comedian's career.</Review>
            <Review>A smart, neurotic slice-of-life comedy about a stand-up comic with confidence issues, commitment issues, and career issues.</Review>

            <Review>This is a great radio bit. Problem is that somebody decided this was a movie, and it is certainly not.</Review>
            <Review>Rarely these days do you come across a comedy so wholly warm-hearted.</Review>
            <Review>Birbiglia humbly finds gold in his unassuming story.</Review>
            <Review>However, there's something ultimately unsatisfying about the experience of listening to stand-up comedian Mike Birbiglia tell the true story of his inability to marry his longtime girlfriend (played by the far-too-hot-to-be-with-him Lauren Ambrose).</Review>

Jason Becker : Not Dead Yet is a feature-length documentary film that tells the incredible story of a guitar legend who refuses to give up on his dream of being a musician despite the most incredible odds.

            <Review>Jesse Vile's inspiring heartbreaker of a documentary is cleaved into two well-judged halves: We see Becker continuing on, robbed of speech and movement, yet undiminshed in his musical creativity.</Review>

            <Review>For a film about aging and romanticism, "Liberal Arts" feels like it needs a more mature script.</Review>
            <Review>Liberal Arts maneuvers its story in a philosophical way that is anything but detached. There's a warmth here that reminds audiences why college -- and, dare we say, their core curriculums? -- matter.</Review>
            <Review>As a comedy of manners, 'Liberal Arts' is perfectly likeable.But you might find its talky touchy-feeliness on the smug side.</Review>
            <Review>There are some entertaining and moving scenes here, but, overall, it's a bit softhearted for my taste.</Review>
            <Review>"Liberal Arts" sticks to the syllabus of a decidedly minor movie, but its humanities faculty is first-rate.</Review>
            <Review>Romantic comedies don't set out to change your life, but Liberal Arts does provide an easy and enjoyable study on growing up and finding contentment, whatever your age.</Review>
            <Review>Liberal Arts is a resolutely vanilla-flavored concoction but still pleasant, amiable, and a little more thoughtful than your average rom-com.</Review>
            <Review>An exuberant, heartfelt concoction, the kind of sunny comedy that's good for the soul.</Review>
            <Review>Some of the insights are a bit simplistic but for most of the running time, the film is an enjoyable diversion.</Review>
            <Review>LIBERAL ARTS never manages to turn these great performances and familiar dilemmas into something substantial.</Review>
            <Review>Liberal laughs are guaranteed but memorable it ain't.</Review>

        <StoryLine>This film attempts to uncover the psychological insights on what made Adolph Hitler history's greatest monster. The Fuehrer (Richard Basehart) is beset with problems in his love life such as an Oedipal complex and impotence. Newsreel footage is inserted to give historical reference to the Nazi atrocities. Hitler is seen in this film as not a figure capable of rising to world dominance, but only a perverse, psychologically flawed madman. Despite the intentions to illuminate his character, no real insight is given about his rise to power, or the demons that plagued the most despicable human being ever to inhabit the planet.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Everything goes on too long -- Ted's carousing, Lori's watchful waiting, John's wistful indecision.</Review>
            <Review>It's a goofy premise pursued with crass -- as well as sentimental -- relish.</Review>
            <Review>You'll feel the warmth and camaraderie of a Bostonian and his little sentient bear.</Review>
            <Review>I tried to resist but couldn't.</Review>
            <Review>The idea of a toy that comes to life - and then won't go away - isn't a bad one. Too bad that "Ted" manages to overstay its welcome without ever really coming to life itself.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is hilarious in fits and starts, but nothing is sustained and every joke, funny or not, is delivered with the dial up to 11.</Review>
            <Review>Very funny until all of the sudden it's not anymore.</Review>
            <Review>A surprisingly funny and crude comedy about a man's relationship with a talking teddy bear.</Review>
            <Review>It is a film that seems to have an endless middle.</Review>
            <Review>Soulless, angry-white-guy comedy at its worst. This is a smug, nasty little number.</Review>
            <Review>I was expecting something more than repetitive jokes, incessant pop culture references and rampant misogyny.</Review>

            <Review>Shares crucial DNA with the earlier films but is drawn from the shallower end of the gene pool.</Review>
            <Review>Perhaps the most interesting question arising from The Bourne Legacy is just how long the filmmakers hope to trade on the Bourne name without any, you know, Bourne.</Review>
            <Review>Renner and Weisz work well together as two hunted souls who initially need each other for utilitarian reasons.</Review>
            <Review>Gilroy's a fine writer - he also penned Michael Clayton - but without the discipline of an action veteran like Greengrass to rein him in, he indulges his weakness to over-explain things.</Review>
            <Review>It's twists and turns and nothing else. And fast and furious as it may be, if this is the best this once-smart series has to offer, this is no legacy.</Review>
            <Review>Jeremy Renner's stock-in-trade is a regular-looking joe who radiates a powerful undercurrent of danger. Given the new storyline, Renner is a perfect replacement for Matt Damon.</Review>
            <Review>Jeremy Renner... fills in Damon's shoes with relish, and better yet, with integrity.</Review>
            <Review>It won't provide the cinematic jolt that many are looking for in a "Bourne" film.</Review>
            <Review>A fine movie, in the end. And that's the problem. It's just fine. The first three "Bourne" movies were incredible.</Review>

        <Duration>85</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Filmmaker Bruce McDonald returns to the mockumentary format of his 1996 cult favorite Hard Core Logo in this sequel of sorts. In this film's alternate universe, McDonald left his native Canada after the box-office success of Hard Core Logo for the United States and a successful career directing cable television projects. Now his career has gone into a tailspin and he's working on a cheesy reality show on Wiccans to pay the rent. In the course of his research, he encounters Care Failure, the manic, drug-fueled lead singer with the punk band Die Mannequin, and learns she's convinced she's been possessed by the spirit of the late Hard Core Logo frontman Joe Dick. Fascinated and needing a new project, McDonald and his crew document Failure as she and her band rehearse for their next album, with some help from iconic singer and songwriter Bucky Haight (Julian Richings). Hard Core Logo II was an official selection at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Yes, this is the part where I outsource my critical role to my children. If you are the kind of person who (quite understandably) abhors this particular gimmick, you may wish to stop reading now.</Review>
            <Review>The best bits are basic and all but voiceless: those Scrat-intensive set pieces, still inspiredly squirrelly if much too far apart.</Review>
            <Review>These films are generally good at being good enough, and the fourth installment, Ice Age: Continental Drift, doesn't deviate from that modest tradition.</Review>
            <Review>In the end, this latest "Ice Age" movie is about as surprising and unpredictable as a glacier. And not much more fun.</Review>
            <Review>Whenever I watch an "Ice Age" movie, I understand how my mother felt whenever I zoned out in front of the television after school.</Review>
            <Review>The swashbuckling stuff is boisterous, if dated, and proves far more engaging than a tedious sub-plot involving Manny's rebellious teenage daughter.</Review>
            <Review>The first "Ice Age" is still the best, but as fabricated and Saturday morning as this installment is, it's still an accomplished bit of animated filmmaking.</Review>
            <Review>Here the franchise that recycles other kids' movies recycles itself.</Review>
            <Review>The beautiful animation and wonderful character design continue to impress, but the seafaring action is sunk by sub-sitcom-level lessons about family and friendship.</Review>
            <Review>Apparently Fox are making a fifth, and people wonder what's pushing originality out of Hollywood.</Review>
            <Review>This is simply the case of a series that has fully run its course without anywhere left to go.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Released about five weeks before the Adolf Eichmann trial began in Jerusalem on April 11, 1961, this docudrama by director R.G. Springsteen was quickly dashed together to take advantage of the trial, and it shows. Overplaying Eichmann's venality and lacking any depth in characterization, the story unfolds in several large segments. Eichmann (played by Werner Klemperer), as head of Dept. IV, B4 or "Jewish affairs/evacuation affairs, personally ordered, or watched, or supervised the extermination of Jews in Germany and the nations under its occupying forces. These years are shown in the first part of the film; the second half deals with Eichmann's escape from an American POW camp, his four years under cover in Germany, aided by an association of Nazi SS members (ODESSA), his escape in 1950 to Argentina through Italy, and his capture on May 11, 1960. ~ Eleanor Mannikka, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <ReleaseDate> 2011</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>93</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Battle for Brooklyn is an intimate look at the very public and passionate fight waged by residents and business owners of Brooklyn's historic Prospect Heights neighborhood facing condemnation of their property to make way for the polarizing Atlantic Yards project, a massive plan to build 16 skyscrapers and a basketball arena for the New Jersey Nets. The film focuses on graphic designer Daniel Goldstein whose apartment sits at what would be center court of the new arena. A reluctant activist, Daniel is dragged into the fight because he can't accept that the government should use the power of Eminent Domain to take his new apartment and hand it off to a private developer, Forest City Ratner. Shot over the course of eight years and compiled from almost 500 hours of footage, Battle for Brooklyn is an epic and universal tale of one man under pressure, and how far he will go to fight for his home and what he believes in. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>In Rehearsal for a Sicilian Tragedy, actor John Turturro (Barton Fink, Do the Right Thing) takes audiences on a haunting, intimate journey to his maternal homeland of Sicily. There, while exploring the island's vanishing traditions, he is taken under the wing of one of the puppet theater's few remaining practitioners, Mimmo Cuticchio, who instructs him in the distinctively Sicilian art of puppetry. Filmed during preparations for the Sicilian Day of the Dead, this evocative, magical-realist documentary was directed by Turturro's longtime collaborator, Roman Paska, himself a world-renowned puppeteer. Both an homage to the art of storytelling and a portrait of a Sicily little known to the outside world, Paska's film brings viewers to an otherworldly place, lost in time.

            <Review>Miami Connection may not be a good film in any conventional sense, but it's great in countless ways.</Review>
            <Review>Hits the sweet spot between stunning ineptitude, hilariously dated period touchstones, and a touching naïveté that gives it an odd distinction.</Review>
            <Review>Absurd, yes, but director Richard Park and his game and guileless cast have the highest of spirits, and the nonsense bubbles like a bottle uncorked.</Review>
            <Review>An 'A' because it is a true 'F'</Review>
            <Review>Even now, all these years later, most of the parties involved are pretty clueless about how utterly, incomprehensibly bad their movie is. And that, truth be told, is part of its charm.</Review>
            <Review>Just a dreadful but naively entertaining made in America martial arts film.</Review>
            <Review>This is a new low in movies. Miss it at all costs.</Review>
            <Review>Although we saw and enjoyed this film, the hype is where the rubber doesn't meet the road. It's funny, cheesy and poorly done in parts but this is bargain bin stuff, not exactly a challenger for a newly found classic of the genre.</Review>
            <Review>Miami Connection is one of those rare films where the positive energy exuded by its oh-so-amateur cast and crew starts to rub off on you, despite the fact that almost all of the basic tenets of motion-picture storytelling are non-existent.</Review>
            <Review>Ineptly written and badly-acted, it's a terrible movie. But it's also a trip, an amusing and striking acid flashback to the cocaine and Reagan, to pre-Grunge Loverboy-Benatar rock and Linda Hamilton "Terminator" hair, the very definition of a cult film.</Review>
            <Review>It may be late, it may not be the way they imagined it, but 'Miami Connection' is finally, gloriously, having its day.</Review>
            <Review>Nonsensical dialogue, painful acting, lots of strobe lights, and even more fighting -- what more could a person want? Perhaps a beheading? Miami Connection has that, too.</Review>

        <StoryLine>The story is about a Marathi girl Meenakshi Deshpande aka "Aiyyaa" falling in love with a Tamil artist. It is a quirky and funny love story with the backdrop of a Marathi-Tamil cultural clash. Aiyyaa lives with her eccentric family next to a smelly rubbish dump, lost in her dream-like Bollywood fantasy world. She gets a job at an arts college where she meets a soul-mate, a buck-toothed Lady GaGa lookalike, and together they go man-hunting. That's until Aiyyaa catches the smell of her dream man, follows the scent and finds a hunky Tamil student, whom she stalks; much to his annoyance. At the same time her barely sane parents are arranging her marriage to a good, sensible boy, who loves Marathi art cinema and rose-planting. The lead female protagonist's dream hunk mysteriously disappears and Aiyyaa is torn: should she settle for the rose garden or woo the stranger she desires as he smells good. </StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>Abigail Brooks (Thomas) has spent her lifetime trying to win an Olympic rowing medal, sacrificing friendship, love, and a "normal life" along the way. When she is named an alternate on the Olympic team she quits in haste. Defeated, Abi moves back home with her widowed, workaholic mother (Margaret Colin). Tension builds as Abi's mother urges her to "move on" from the rowing life that Abi's father, a coach, introduced her to. Unable to do so, but needing an immediate job, Abi seizes an open crew coach position at her alma mater, Union High. There, the head of athletics is her old boyfriend, Geoff (James Van Der Beek). Abi trains her high school rowers in an obsessive fashion, taking two girls, Hannah (Alexandra Metz) and Susan (Meredith Apfelbaum), under her wing. After the girls lose an important regional race, Abi reinvents herself as a coach, and, in the process, learns to have fun again both on the water and off. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>A movie whose main virtue was its honesty ultimately lands in a place that feels canned and unsatisfying. But on the way there, Backwards isn't so bad.</Review>
            <Review>The biggest problem ... is the characters who populate the film. For the most part, they're one-dimensional caricatures.</Review>
            <Review>The neatness of the plotting becomes almost comical after a while. Construction is one thing; contrivance is another.</Review>
            <Review>Although this modest indie may not make a huge splash, it just might inspire some hearty younger viewers - especially women - to grab a set of oars and find their bliss.</Review>

            <Review>Backwards" is obvious at times, but what makes it stand out are the details that Thomas imbues in her character.</Review>
            <Review>Corny and predictable, sure, but Backwards will appeal to a few junior oarswomen around Seattle.</Review>
            <Review>Even James Van Der Beek, so natural as a high school athletic director that you can't help but wonder if he's actually spent time in that job, can't save this film from drowning.</Review>

Gayby is an irreverent comedy about friendship, growing older, sex, loneliness, and the family you choose. -- (C) Wolfe Releasing</StoryLine>

            <Review>What lifts Gayby above its sitcom trappings is its emotional generosity and easy warmth, the sense that characters are defined by -- and made funny through -- their aspirations, not their way with a one-liner.</Review>
            <Review>Harris, a talented comic actress who looks more like a real person than a Hollywood facsimile of one, makes every scene she's in shine.</Review>
            <Review>"Gayby" is too diffuse to have much pop when it comes to the topics at hand: love and friendship, and how unconventional modern permutations might help rewrite the script of romance.</Review>
            <Review>[It] embraces broad jokes and obvious setups. Fortunately, these are balanced out by assertive pacing and entertaining observations.</Review>
            <Review>The film develops into a sweet, surprisingly persuasive comedy about friends transitioning into family.</Review>
            <Review>Lisecki gives this story a modest, quip-filled heartbeat; nothing is painted too broadly, and the complications and awkwardness of the situation play out with great warmth.</Review>
            <Review>The good in Gayby easily outweighs the awkward staging and strained gags.</Review>
            <Review>Your enjoyment of this baby-obsessed queer farce will depend largely upon your tolerance for seeing yet another group of gay urbanites incessantly sniping about it all.</Review>
            <Review>A fresh, breezy take on modern gay life and platonic love delivered with disarming enthusiasm and genuine wit.</Review>
            <Review>While Jonathan Lisecki is well in tune with his film's niche market, his knack for comedy, both visual and verbal, is universally hilarious.</Review>
            <Review>A fast-paced, often hilarious pic about a woman who choose a gay friend to make her pregnant.</Review>
            <Review>Lisecki directs deftly and lightly, and spreads the jokes around his strong cast.</Review>

            <Review>An amusing if slight look at the grooming, preening and stylistic ways of the 21st century man.</Review>
            <Review>It's more first-person journal and travelogue than it is cultural archaeology, and as such it's basically OK.</Review>
            <Review>There's no real center to the film's potentially insightful topic, with Spurlock never zeroing in on a cohesive message.</Review>
            <Review>As documentaries go, this is lip gloss.</Review>
            <Review>The movie purports to be a lighthearted look at changing notions of masculinity and appearance. But unless you find something intrinsically hilarious about a man getting a pedicure, laughs are scarce.</Review>
            <Review>This complete waste of 82 minutes finds documentarian Morgan Spurlock taking a look at current trends in men's grooming, featuring interviews with a random sampling of people who have no idea what they're talking about - but they're famous.</Review>
            <Review>You'll forget about this one while you're still watching it.</Review>
            <Review>Reality TV lacks Spurlock's sly willingness to let the eccentric explain themselves, rather than letting them appear foolish. It's not deep, but then, it's about vanity.</Review>
            <Review>Spurlock seems to be wholeheartedly interested in the motivating factors behind manscaping and other choices men make about their appearances.</Review>
            <Review>Just because the film's subject is surfaces doesn't mean it only warrants a slight, surface treatment.</Review>
            <Review>Mansome is arguably [Spurlock's] most insignificant, lightweight effort to date. Never mind that it doesn't provide any answers; it barely even asks a question.</Review>
            <Review>A lighthearted and entertaining, but ultimately inconsequential look at masculine identity as seen through the varied grooming habits of the modern male.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2012</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>90</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Would anyone miss you? Nobody noticed when Joyce Vicent died in her bedsit above a shopping mall in North London in 2003. Her body wasn't discovered for three years, surrounded by Christmas presents she had been wrapping, and with the TV still on. Newspaper reports offered few details of her life -- not even a photograph. Interweaving interviews with imagined scenes from Joyce's life is not only a portrait of Joyce but a portrait on London in the eighties -- the city, music and race. It is a film about urban lives, contemporary life, and how, like Joyce, we are all different things to different people. It is about how little we may ever know each other, but nevertheless, how much we can love. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>Somewhere at the bottom of this story is an ache about the value of a life.</Review>
            <Review>Its holes or omissions cannot diminish the gaping eloquence of the situation and the questions that arise.</Review>
            <Review>Dreams of a Life unintentionally amounts to a mean-spirited snooze.</Review>
            <Review>For all its subtext about identity and London's social fabric, "Dreams of a Life" leaves too many blanks and is ultimately more frustrating than rewarding.</Review>
            <Review>A riveting tale of a onetime vivacious personality, described by those who knew her as "stunning," "lovely," and "very well liked," but who nevertheless died alone, friendless and seemingly missed by nobody.</Review>
            <Review>Director Morley has at least restored something of a soul to her subject.</Review>
            <Review>How awfully, strangely death can void a personal identity. The filling-in of the chalk outline remains sketchy, as Morley well knows. This docu-obituary's sharply aware of its own bit-ness, its partial-ness.</Review>
            <Review>I like how Morely juxtaposes urban life with inner life, and how the two don't always intersect.</Review>
            <Review>Disappointing documentary-fiction hybrid on the true story of a woman found dead and alone in an apartment three years after her demise. A pile-up of unanswered questions and unidentified witnesses frustrates more than it intrigues.</Review>
            <Review>Dreams of a Life succeeds in making its point about the unkowability of the people in our lives, but there isn't quite enough substance here to fully sustain the film.</Review>
            <Review>Stunningly perplexing ... while it does leave you terribly bummed out in the end, it also leaves you with a whole lot of questions.</Review>
            <Review>It's a fascinating film, skilfully assembled, and one is inevitably reminded of Citizen Kane and Rashomon...</Review>

A baby daughter is born, but Jaromil's infidelities and the arrival of Russian tanks in Prague leaded Madeleine back to France - though the love between them still burns. Thirty years later in London, we follow Madeleine's daughter, Vera (Chiara Mastroianni), who has fallen in love with a musician (Paul Schneider) who is incapable of devoting himself to her, while her ex (Honore regular Louis Garrel) still pines for her. Meanwhile, in Paris, a re-married Madeleine (Catherine Deneuve) has rekindled her love affair with Jaromil (Milos Forman). -- (C) IFC</StoryLine>

            <Review>Plays like one long, slow descent into cloying moralizing and uplift that's well past its expiration date.</Review>
            <Review>The movie's entire superior attitude is kind of annoying.</Review>
            <Review>We're still just scratching the surface of witty, provocative humor as long as envelope-pushing directors such as Jim Field Smith continue to find work.</Review>
            <Review>At times, the Midwestern satire "Butter" is almost funny, and in its honor I almost laughed.</Review>
            <Review>'Butter' pokes R-rated comedy (lots of swearing) fun at dirty politics, as well as the 4-H club-attending, pie-baking, cow-comparing, butter-carving, red state demographic.</Review>
            <Review>The final result, however, is a complete oddity that is less an interesting political satire and more the piercing examination of butter carving competitions that no one ever asked for.</Review>
            <Review>The characters want to melt your heart, but like everything in "Butter," they're just too pat.</Review>
            <Review>Butter is a dizzying blend of smug satire, surface-level observations and mean-spirited swipes at flyover types. Oh, and take away Olivia Wilde and it's a laugh-free affair.</Review>
            <Review>A movie concerned with the seemingly ridiculous world of butter carving may not sound like a smart, tear-jerking, must-watch political satire. Yet Jim Field Smith's sophomore effort Butter is all of the above and more.</Review>

            <Review>Mostly, The Odd Life of Timothy Green feels contrived , if undeniably sweet.</Review>
            <Review>From director and writer Peter Hedges comes a wonderful tale about the power of intention, being careful of what you wish for, self-acceptance, love, loss, and new beginnings.</Review>
            <Review>Likely to please younger audiences who will find the simple, fairy story style arc comfortingly familiar and the central protagonist quirkily relatable.</Review>
            <Review>Even allowing for a certain level of unreality in a movie intended as an allegory, The Odd Life of Timothy Green smells of contrivance and falseness.</Review>
            <Review>Instead of wanting to turn over a new "leaf," I wound up OD-ing on sap.</Review>
            <Review>As odd as the title suggests, this is a strange and dreadfully overwrought family yarn.</Review>
            <Review>Not so much moving as stomach churning.</Review>

            <Review>Streep fans, I think you're going to enjoy this one. I know I did.</Review>
            <Review>The film, a rehab job on a beached marriage, displays the most tender respect, the most exquisite tact, and yet it would be completely unwatchable -- an outright embarrassment -- with any other actors than Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl Streep.</Review>
            <Review>It's tough to come up with new superlatives for Meryl Streep, but the 63-year-old actress delivers her most frankly sexual performance yet in Hope Springs.</Review>
            <Review>All that's missing are commercials for estrogen cream and erectile-dysfunction meds.</Review>
            <Review>Streep is warm, and she's got the timing of a stand-up. Her performance demands you bat for her woman.</Review>
            <Review>It's all a little depressing.</Review>
            <Review>There are parts of the film that work beautifully, all of which feature Jones' innate ability to emote with a look, a gesture, or a sigh.</Review>
            <Review>Unlike the cloying contrivances of It's Complicated, Hope Springs is audacious in its commitment to subtle authenticity, never artificially upping the dramatic stakes but instead staying true to its small yet relatable story.</Review>
            <Review>As well-written as it is, with frank analysis of what can make a good marriage lose its spark over time, the film gets its emotional resonance from the heartfelt performances.</Review>
            <Review>This dramedy offers a refreshingly-honest and comedic look at an aging couple still trying to make their relationship work.</Review>
            <Review>As estranged bedfellows, Tommy Lee Jones (he's a little bit Harvard) and Meryl Streep (she's a little bit Yale) make great combatants in a rousing battle of the sexes.</Review>
            <Review>...a refreshingly adult endeavor that benefits from its honest sensibilities and from the stellar performances of its leads.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>An exquisitely crafted, brilliant, confusing, disordered, maddening, and wonderfully flawed film that tries to show life as it is lived.</Review>
            <Review>It creates the lived-in sense of being in the world of the characters.</Review>
            <Review>Bouquet and the waterways of Venice are the chief charms of Téchiné's movie, which is otherwise one of his less convincing efforts.</Review>
            <Review>What makes the film involving is that it doesn't depend on the mechanical resolution of the plot, but on the close observation of its effects on these distinctive characters.</Review>
            <Review>[Unforgivable] sets out as an account of unusual lives, finishes as a portrait of a society -- one that lives between the conventional and the openly low.</Review>
            <Review>It's clearly the work of a master storyteller, conveying a rich, novelistic sense of character and a poetic feeling for the passing of time.</Review>
            <Review>Francis's fluster-as evinced by Dussollier and nurtured by Téchiné-makes for a pleasure both subtle and mildly sadistic.</Review>
            <Review>Techine's latest is rich in emotional intrigue</Review>
            <Review>Though the movie lasts a reasonably brief 107 minutes, Téchiné is in no hurry to reveal his characters. We're still learning about them in the last few scenes, and our loyalties and attractions change.</Review>
            <Review>Flat and a bit stale, like the characters. Not one of Téchiné's finest.</Review>
            <Review>Unforgivable is a bit too relaxed to function as a thriller. Though admirably unpredictable, its plot is also spread thin among these fickle lovers.</Review>
            <Review>The pervasive morbidity of Venice holds the narrative together, and a melancholy that companionship, parenthood, and art can't console.</Review>

            <Review>The reality it takes place in is heightened just enough to make the concept feel ironic, but then all attempt at genuine sentiment subsequently falls flat.</Review>
            <Review>An hour and a half of darkening absurdism.</Review>
            <Review>The film takes some deciphering, but once a viewer cracks its code "Alps" opens up into something expansive and rich.</Review>
            <Review>The movie contains some of the same elements that made [Dogtooth] so startling but they tend to float around rather than coalesce into a singular perspective.</Review>
            <Review>A film peculiar beyond all understanding, based on a premise that begs belief.</Review>
            <Review>A strange story. A strange world. And strange characters doing even stranger things.</Review>
            <Review>It will certainly keep you interested, but the ending lacks the strength to make it work completely. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>In fact, you probably shouldn't be reading this review if you have an interest in seeing the film.</Review>
            <Review>Emphatically weird, watchable and niche.</Review>
            <Review>It's hard to see what, if anything, Lanthimos is saying about modern Greece. And without that clear focus, the film feels a bit off-piste.</Review>

Lady Helen had secretly gone to Dover to pay off the blackmailer who possessed letters linking her husband romantically to a married woman. Her trust in her spouse is further tested when he is later accused of killing the woman addressed in the letters. Did Lady Helen wed a murderer?

        <StoryLine>Tonight on the program at the Hollywood Bowl: murder! A bravura production of Verdi's Il Trovatore is the setting for this con brio blend of music, mystery and murder most foul. Leo Carrillo portrays Gino D'Acosta, a brilliant tenor who has millions of die-hard fans and at least one die-now enemy. Warned of impending doom by a mystic, Gino laughs it off - until he performs an aria, then perishes - the victim of poisoning - in front of 20,000 wildly applauding witnesses. Whodunit? An L.A. cop (Chester Morris) has a long cast of suspects: the mystic, a deranged composer, an ambitious understudy, the cuckolded opera conductor, Gino's cast-off mistress, Gino's latest sweetheart and the sweetheart's former beau (Duncan Renaldo, who would play Cisco to Carrillo's Pancho in The Cisco Kid TV series and several films). The plot thickens when one of the suspects is the next to die. Can you spot the killer before he - or she - strikes again?</StoryLine>

        <Title>The Falls</Title>
        <ReleaseDate/>
        <Duration>89</Duration>
        <StoryLine>You see them everywhere, Mormon Missionaries dressed in their white shirts, ties and suit pants. With their short cut hair they ride on their bicycles and knock on doors, trying to convert the world to their brand of religion. In their Church Community they are revered for exemplifying to the world the wholesomeness and goodness of being a young Mormon youth. RJ and Chris are no different. Both were born and raised in the Mormon Church. Both accelerated academically, progressed ecclesiastically, earned their Eagle Scout at a young age and had pretty girl friends. And now it's their turn to serve a mission and experience the Mormon rite of passage. Unknown to them, serving a mission would not only open stranger's doors to "preach the Gospel" to as they were taught; but secrets of their own lives would be awakened while in the service of their fellow man. The Falls captures the lives of two American teens struggling to make sense of the conflicts between their worlds, their feelings and each other. What they find in themselves and in each other is unpredictable but a compliment to the human spirit.</StoryLine>

            <Review>A Christian themed movie that needs better acting and definitely a better script.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2012</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>90</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Today skateboarding is omnipresent. Take a walk down any street in any town, and you are destined to see someone riding a skateboard. Well, it wasn't always like that. In the early '80s, skateboarding was fading away until Stacy Peralta brought a profoundly talented group of outsiders together and dubbed them the Bones Brigade. This documentary chronicles their epic rise, using awesome archival footage and moving first-person accounts from Brigade members Steve Caballero, Tommy Guerrero, Tony Hawk, Mike McGill, Lance Mountain, and Rodney Mullen, among others. Through passion, drive, creativity, and a surprising sense of teamwork, they revitalized the sport and influenced generations to come. BONES BRIGADE will blow the minds of anyone who grew up emulating these guys, but it also resonates for anyone who ever found a family or a purpose in an unexpected place.</StoryLine>

This film is about Jonathan's life, and what led these two dramatic story arcs to intersect on that fateful day. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>A straightforward documentary that uses Yoni's own words - in the form of his moving, eloquent letters and poems - to create a searing portrait of his short but meaningful life.</Review>
            <Review>[It] serves up its material with an excess of treacly music and an overabundance of glowing reminiscences. This has the odd effect of making his story less powerful than it actually is.</Review>

        <Duration>120</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Larry Brothers scripted this adaptation of the James Lee Burke novel that begins in a Louisiana penal colony during the 1830s. After middle-aged Allison (Kris Kristofferson) and young Holland (Scott Bairstow) make an escape, they take along Sana, a Choctaw (Irene Bedard, of Disney's animated Pocahontas) and head for the encampment of Sam Houston (Tom Skerritt) in East Texas. When Holland and Sana get too close, Allison tells Holland to drop her, and the two ride off, leaving her in the dust. Eventually, they link up with Houston and Allison's longtime pal Jim Bowie (Peter Coyote), but Bowie is off to confront General Santa Anna (Marco Rodriguez) at the Alamo. After the battle, Allison and Holland meet widow Dickinson (Karey Green) at the Alamo ruins. This TV movie premiered January 18, 1997 on TNT.</StoryLine>

        <Duration>91</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry is the first feature-length film about the internationally renowned Chinese artist and activist, Ai Weiwei. In recent years, Ai has garnered international attention as much for his ambitious artwork as his political provocations. From 2008 to 2010, Beijing-based journalist and filmmaker Alison Klayman gained unprecedented access to Ai Weiwei. Klayman documented Ai's artistic process in preparation for major museum exhibitions, his intimate exchanges with family members and his increasingly public clashes with the Chinese government. Klayman's detailed portrait of the artist provides a nuanced exploration of contemporary China and one of its most compelling public figures. -- (C) IFC</StoryLine>

            <Review>A fascinating portrait of a modern artist and activist trying to make a difference within China's repressive political system.</Review>
            <Review>The film's recurring theme is of an artist on a perpetual hunt for transparency, in his country and abroad.</Review>
            <Review>A movie that somehow mixes apprehension for Ai with a feeling of warmth and, certainly, fun.</Review>
            <Review>Affable and unpretentious, Ai comes across as a cagey operator whose candor is very appealing.</Review>
            <Review>It's likely to change the way you think about art and politics and the state of China today.</Review>
            <Review>Using archival footage dating back to Ai's adventures in the New York art world in his 20s, Klayman traces his evolution as a creator and as an activist.</Review>
            <Review>To say Ai Weiwei is an interesting character is an understatement. He is an unconventional social activist and a thorn in the side of the authoritarian Chinese Communist Party.</Review>
            <Review>Ai Weiwei is such a laid back, calm and yet mischievous spirit that the film takes on a whole different, almost joyous tone.</Review>
            <Review>The film is about the power and limits of art.</Review>
            <Review>Klayman never demonizes the authoritarian Chinese government, as her purpose seems to be to show how difficult it is to be a rebel in such a closed society as China.</Review>
            <Review>A compelling documentary that explodes proper and stuffy notions of what a foreign intellectual dissident looks and sounds like.</Review>
            <Review>The struggle for free speech in China is given sharp, sobering, disturbing voice through the struggles of cutting edge, digitally savvy, Twitter-loving artist Ai Weiwei.</Review>

            <Review>The script was enough of a mess to stop the shooting for high-priced rewrites, but you know what they say about washing garbage.</Review>
            <Review>The movie represents at least a partial return to form--not as inventive as the first, but surely better than the recycled materials that made up the second.</Review>
            <Review>It turns out to be reasonably entertaining, though not enough to make me crave Men in Black 4.</Review>
            <Review>The Smith-Jones duo's return as the titularly clad operatives, while not exactly essential, comes with the charms of reprised, well-liked characters and a "didn't-see-that-coming" conclusion that makes up for the first hour's sequelitis.</Review>
            <Review>If there ever is a "Men in Black IV" -- and at this point, it's hard to imagine one -- let's hope it finds that delicate balance between the yuks and the yucks.</Review>
            <Review>This spirited three-quel comes close to the exuberance of the first Men in Black and is a distinct improvement over its limp 2002 follow-up.</Review>
            <Review>What could possibly go wrong with this formula? Threequel-itis, that's what. MIB 1 was great, MIB 2 not so much, MIB 3-just not cuttin' the mustard.</Review>
            <Review>Whilst MIB III wraps up the series neatly, there's talk of a fourth already and you can't help but feel the joke is wearing a little thin.</Review>
            <Review>A decade-late three-quel anticipated by nobody.</Review>
            <Review>It's not a totally unpleasant way to spend an escapist evening, but considering the talent involved, 'MiB3' should have been more out of this world.</Review>
            <Review>This is the proper sequel to the 1997 original, and not the 2002 laugh-free abomination, Men in Black II.</Review>

Liz (Aoife Duffin) is a twenty-something woman trying to put her life back in order after kicking drugs and giving up her career as a hooker. Liz has a handicapped son who is in foster care, and en route to a visit with her boy, she gets roped into giving a ride to Eddie (Nigel O'Neill), a middle aged slob with little to lose but his waistline. Before long, Liz discovers she's tangled up in a drug smuggling scheme that involves a nervous sheep, though on the bright side, Eddie's hobby as a birdwatcher gives them the opportunity to appreciate the highly unusual avian life they encounter along the way.

            <Review>It's equal parts 'Flashdance,' 'Burlesque' and 'Lambada', all parts ludicrous - but we aren't here for the story any more than we watch Béla Tarr for the salsa numbers.</Review>
            <Review>There's too much color and energy and frenzy in this movie to discount it entirely, but it has a disconcerting tendency to undercut its best notions with some singularly awful moves.</Review>
            <Review>With the most wooden leads of the series to date - an MMA fighter and a "So You Think You Can Dance" alum - the drama between the dancing has never felt more interminable.</Review>

            <Review>While dance purists won't be impressed by the energetic and athletic choreography -- the dancers have clearly learned routines but not necessarily technique -- date-movie audiences will likely want to go out dancing afterward themselves, and that's fun.</Review>

            <Review>Many of the old tropes and gimmicks from the previous films are recycled into an all-too-familiar plotline: An edgy, streetwise guy falls for a classy, upper-crust sweetie, and together they dance their way past obstacle after obstacle.</Review>

            <Review>This horror movie from Warner Bros. is nothing special, but it's nice to see a modest genre entertainment buoyed by a major studio's resources.</Review>
            <Review>The entity is a ghostly presence amid an even ghostlier absence. This is truly distressed real estate.</Review>
            <Review>Something lacking either body heat or visceral suspense.</Review>
            <Review>For casual viewers desiring a few scares, some suspense and a sustained sense of dread and malevolence, you could do worse.</Review>
            <Review>Lights flicker; soap and cactuses blacken; claw marks appear; icky molds gather like hornet nests.</Review>
            <Review>Might give you a restless night, but only because you fell asleep in the theater.</Review>
            <Review>Devoid of scares and energy, the picture is all bumps in the night and has nothing to set it apart from its other forgettable post-Japanese horror contemporaries.</Review>
            <Review>In so many ways a missed opportunity, The Apparition looked like it could conjure a few scares in telling the story of a couple haunted by an entity they helped release, but this Ashley Greene vehicle fades into the void with a yawn.</Review>
            <Review>None of this matters at all because the main characters are completely unlikable, and the momentum is consistently ruined by poor decision-making.</Review>
            <Review>It's frightening to think that a major studio like Warner Brothers would not only release a film this bad into theaters nationwide, but that it would even green light it in the first place.</Review>
            <Review>Dull, dreary, pointless and bad, sporting shock scenes that don't shock, a grisly premise that doesn't make sense, and a meager cast of mostly uninterested-looking Hollywood lookers.</Review>
            <Review>From start to finish, the movie basks in horrible horror clichés that will leave viewers straining to find something original in the proceedings.</Review>

        <Title>The Sea Gull</Title>
        <ReleaseDate/>
        <Duration>141</Duration>
        <StoryLine>This is one of several film versions of the classic play by Anton Chekhov. The depressing tale of unrequited love begins when an aging actress Arkadina (Simone Signoret) and her arrogant writer companion Trigorin (James Mason) travel to a small Russian town to visit her brother, an ailing public official in retirement. Nina (Vanessa Redgrave) is the neighbor girl who falls for Trigorin. The simple country girl is degraded by the older, more worldly author as she follows him to the big city and falls victim to the debauchery of urban life. Arkadina also deals with a hateful son who is driven to suicide in this somber and depressing film. Although there are some moments of comedy in the play, this film version is decidedly more downbeat. ~ Dan Pavlides, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>Fuelled by confident direction and awe inspiring performances, Burning Man is an uncompromising exploration of how one man's grief leads him on a destructive and soul searching path to acceptance.</Review>
            <Review>As a complete package, Burning Man is very good, but a little too pristine to be great.</Review>
            <Review>The emotional payoff is undermined by the structural play -- a strategy that distracts rather than enhances.</Review>
            <Review>Writer/director Jonathan Teplitzky offsets the grimness of making a film about overcoming grief by modelling what could have been a morbidly despairing downer into a pot of revved-up and risqué drama with a soulful core simmering beneath the bombast.</Review>

            <Review>"ParaNorman" took a huge risk on a scarier concept, and it paid off enormously.</Review>
            <Review>"ParaNorman" is never less than entertaining, but you'll have to follow it into a strange purgatory between two opposing genres.</Review>
            <Review>If the story lacks the consistent psychological depth of Coraline, another tale of an outcast finding solace in a parallel world, amends are made during the lovely climax.</Review>
            <Review>By placing weighty, real world lessons aimed at kids in this specific cinematic world, the gloominess is only intensified.</Review>

United by a belief that that this unassuming beach belongs to the people, this tenacious 'band of brothers' have held off construction of the new hotel-despite constant pressure from Marriott managers-and the Puerto Rican government, which supports tourism. Filmmaker Juan C. Davila moves into the camp and explores the unique personalities, deep passions and determination of the people who are fighting an ongoing battle to protect the beach. In the shadow of a multi-million dollar construction project, a ragtag group of concerned activists come together and show how the power of the people can defeat a giant.

This critically acclaimed adaptation of one of the most highly regarded books in the history of American literature, tells the story, almost in mythical fashion, of lost and lonely souls taken to a Chicago Heights boarding house where layfolk and churchfolk alike struggle with their personal demons.

            <Review>What makes Rites of Spring worthwhile is that it plays like a kidnapping caper some slasher happened to slice its way into, which keeps the premise fresh enough to hold down a 90-minute feature.</Review>

Lost, starving, and exhausted, they seek shelter in a seemingly safe abandoned farmhouse. However, while searching for food and resources, they unwittingly set off a trap signaling to their ruthless predators lying in wait to begin their deadly attack. With food and ammunition dwindling, the group must make a desperate final stand-over a 24 hour period-battling for their ultimate survival. -- (C) Anchor Bay</StoryLine>

            <Review>The film feels unbelievably long at 84 minutes, and the color-drained, hand-held cinematography serves only as a reminder of just how good "Night of the Living Dead" really was.</Review>
            <Review>A savage B-movie thriller with unrealized aspirations to profundity ...</Review>
            <Review>Every day is gloomy in "The Day," Douglas Aarniokoski's film with a creepy, paranoid atmosphere that's more effective than the performances.</Review>
            <Review>Towards the end, you might find yourself thinking, "Well, this could have been worse." And you'll mean it as a compliment.</Review>
            <Review>"The Day" is just good enough to engage audiences, but it falls well short of remarkable, leaving viewers wishing for a dawn that never breaks.</Review>
            <Review>"The Day" cycles through bursts of horrific violence only to end much as it begins: static, hollow and vague.</Review>
            <Review>Could definitely have benefited from twenty more minutes of story.</Review>
            <Review>Take Cormac McCarthy's The Road and cross-pollinate it with a couple dozen other more aggressively low-grade genre entries and the result is this very self-serious yet narratively unoriginal offering.</Review>
            <Review>While The Day certainly isn't a game changer by any means, it still remains a rather entertaining indie film that manages to deliver a few unique spins on a world that we've seen countless times before.</Review>
            <Review>Glum, poorly acted, and hard on the eyes, The Day is a flat feature with a few spikes of absurdity that push the production into unintentional camp.</Review>
            <Review>Once these tropes are established and have a minute or two to settle, that's when things get interesting.</Review>
            <Review>Despite being a nasty and skillful action film, Douglas Aarniokoski's film goes off the rails in the final stretch.</Review>

            <Review>It's slight and casual to the point of laziness, but it's straight fun, done with knowledge and a laconic pleasure. You could do far worse.</Review>
            <Review>The center of narrative gravity is hard to locate; for whom are we rooting, and does anything really ripple outward from this nasty local fight?</Review>
            <Review>Fans of The Proposition will have to settle for sublimely evil performances by Gary Oldman (as a murderous rival) and Guy Pearce (as a government agent) and a large quotient of gut-wrenching violence.</Review>
            <Review>With a dynamite cast, an iconic screenwriter in rocker Nick Cave and an Aussie director in John Hillcoat, you assume a new classic. What you get is an ambitious try.</Review>
            <Review>You can sense the filth, and smell the rust, and feel the ingrained poverty that might well convince a family of survivors (of World War I and the Spanish flu) to make their fortune selling moonshine to their neighbors.</Review>
            <Review>There's something at the movie's heart that remains flimsy and inauthentic, a kid in his older brother's ill-fitting shoes.</Review>
            <Review>The recurring act of violence In 'Lawless' is a brass-knuckle punch to the throat. It's not pretty. The movie's not pretty either, but it's an instant gangster classic.</Review>
            <Review>The film has jolts of dread and calculated savagery, and yet it feels prosaic and uninspired.</Review>
            <Review>A stylish, streamlined, and thrilling prohibition era action yarn.</Review>
            <Review>Tom Hardy must just hate being audible.</Review>
            <Review>Hillcoat makes a foray into Virginia's Prohibition-era moonshine country. But the adaptation (by Hillcoat compadre Nick Cave) is a hokey piece of pop history that wearyingly insists upon its own mythos like a comic-book blockbuster.</Review>
            <Review>This fact-based drama succeeds because of its great cast and its strong story of loyalty and brotherhood.</Review>

            <Review>"The Expendables 2" is lazily satisfied with repeating the first movie's formula, shortcomings and grisly strengths alike, just as the first movie was content to slavishly, ploddingly cover the hits of the '80s.</Review>
            <Review>Nice to know America's action stars, no matter how old they get, will never lack for gainful employment.</Review>
            <Review>Does exactly what it's supposed to do - no more, no less.</Review>
            <Review>The Expendables 2 makes a franchise out of a novelty item, and the nostalgic kick is gone: It's a reminder that most of those '80s actioners were xenophobic and dumb, that many of its stars had more muscle mass than charisma.</Review>
            <Review>Yeah, yeah, I get it: "The Expendables 2" is a fun-loving throwback to the gloriously bad action films of the 1980s. Here's what I don't get: Why couldn't it be a throwback to the good ones?</Review>
            <Review>At least it's efficiently and breezily forgettable. What's more, there are laughs too and here's the best part - one or two of them are actually intentional.</Review>
            <Review>Little-known biological phenomenon: When a human body is shot, stabbed or punched really hard, it explodes like a balloon filled with ketchup. Also, heads and limbs detach with the ease of a G.I. Joe doll in the hands of a malevolent 3-year-old.</Review>
            <Review>It's loud and dumb, sure. But it's affable and funny in ways the original wasn't.</Review>
            <Review>Of course it's garbage. But this is my favorite kind of garbage.</Review>
            <Review>This sequel knows what its audience is looking for and succeeds admirably in providing it.</Review>
            <Review>The movies that many of these guys made in the 1980s and '90s were hardly bulletproof, but this is a cynical exercise in settling for what is expected to be passable.</Review>
            <Review>At this point it's such a juvenile and boring experience with god awful writing, that it completely eliminates the fun of watching action heroes kick ass on screen.</Review>

While cruising in Sam's beat up "classic" convertible on a road trip they find themselves in the small town of Rocky Road. Rocky Road is run by Rusty Pickens (Barry Corbin, No Country For Old Men) who has pretty much everybody in his back pocket, and after finding themselves in a spot of trouble with the local police, Sam and friends dig themselves deeper and deeper into trouble. After claiming to have been 'saved' while in jail, the troublesome trio lands in the hands of the corrupt Rusty who puts them to work as new ministers in the church and it's up to them to convince Rusty and the residents of Rocky Road that they are indeed the real deal! Soon though, it becomes clear to the newly appointed 'ministers' that Rusty doesn't have the good people's interests at heart and is using Sam and his pals to do his dirty work. It's up to the guys to rise to the occasion and to prove to themselves (and maybe the big guy upstairs too) that they have what it takes to do the right thing in this hilarious fish-out-of-water tale!</StoryLine>

            <Review>This is a film made with love, bolstered by wonderfully etched vignettes, Ranbir Kapoor's stupendous performance and a gorgeous soundtrack by Pritam. And yet, for me, Barfi was a singularly frustrating experience.</Review>
            <Review>It is with some reluctance that we leave the beautiful world of Barfi!, but we do so with the knowledge that the Kapoor family legacy is safe in the hands of Ranbir, who can already lay claim to the title of the finest actor of his generation.</Review>

            <Review>Barfi! is that rare film that can make you smile and make you cry in the same scene. Its technical brilliance is only outdone by its emotional complexity and depth.</Review>
            <Review>Barfi is more than ably handled by Anurag Basu. He remarkably immerses you in his world of sounds and verbose silences, recreating Chaplin's antics, stripping two superstars down to basics and sensitively spinning a magical world of unconditional love.</Review>
            <Review>Barfi is a safe bet. Populist, instantly likeable, charming and unfortunately, a tad too light.</Review>

            <Review>Like with any great singer, it's often the telling pauses of the man born Anthony Benedetto that say the most in "The Zen of Bennett."</Review>
            <Review>These elements leave the documentary hanging somewhere between a glorified making-of album promo and a more in-depth portrait of the artist.</Review>
            <Review>Friendly doc offers plentiful guest stars but only one perspective on the singer's career.</Review>
            <Review>The way Mr. Bennett talks is the way he sings. There is no subtext, only the song conveyed with knowledge, heart, a sophisticated sense of swing and a positive attitude.</Review>
            <Review>It feels a bit like a classed-up infomercial at times, but it's still as much a treat to witness Bennett's process as it is to see him interact with today's young stars.</Review>
            <Review>As simple as Tony Bennett's life is, his magic could've used a documentary less simple-minded than The Zen of Bennett to explain it.</Review>

        <Duration>93</Duration>
        <StoryLine>In an effort to escape her murky past and build a better future, Olive (Milla Jovovich), a nomadic European con-artist, and her 10-year-old American-born son, Bobby(Spencer List), find themselves living in Oklahoma. As her top priority, Olive seeks to give Bobby the things she never had: she enrolls him in school, makes him do his homework and tries her hardest to be a good mother, and with the help of an old friend from Oklahoma, Walt (Rory Cochrane), Olive "provides" for Bobby in the only way she knows how. But despite of her efforts (or perhaps because of them) Bobby displays troubling behavior both at his school and in their conservative neighborhood. Things take a turn for the worse after Bobby's unfortunate "run-in" with the local and wealthy businessman Kent (Bill Pullman), and Olive's criminal past finally catches up with her, forcing her to make the toughest judgment of all.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Actress Famke Janssen wrote and directed this half-spiky, A-for-effort dramedy about a grifter mom struggling to raise her preteen son on the road.</Review>
            <Review>Milla Jovovich delivers an over-the-top peformance in this melodramatic tale of an immigrant con artist and her juvenile delinquent son.</Review>
            <Review>Bringing Up Bobby centers around a mugging performance by Jovovich, who can't ground the film's attempts to tie together sentiments from Paper Moon and Miss Saigon.</Review>
            <Review>'"Bringing Up Bobby" is hardly an auspicious debut for Janssen as a director, but, at the same time, there's enough there to suggest that a next attempt would be worthy of investigation...</Review>
            <Review>Ms. Jovovich displays such a keen awareness of her strengths that she brings out magical elements I never believed possible.</Review>
            <Review>Bringing Up Bobby is strongly recommended for both young teens and adults. It is a film that will help all of us survive and move on, in the beautiful yet uncomfortable world of our own making.</Review>
            <Review>Famke Janssen only rarely finds her way to the lowdown and lowlife world of the characters, and never and brings "Bobby" up to the level of pathos of "A Mother's Sacrifice" that she was aiming for in the first place.</Review>
            <Review>... a mess filled with condescending stereotypes, unlikeable characters, earnest melodrama and references to old movies that are better.</Review>
            <Review>Stumbles through scenes without a consistent tone, hoping to shape something meaningful out of its display of misguided parenting. Janssen just doesn't have the vision to achieve it.</Review>
            <Review>Just an extended dramatization of the 1980s anti-drug PSA that memorably cautioned "I learned it by watching you!"</Review>
            <Review>The script, by first-time director Famke Janssen, condescends to the heartland, and minor roles collapse to stereotype.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Six-foot-six Ukrainian brothers Vitali and Wladimir Klitschko moved to Germany to begin careers in heavyweight boxing in 1996, and the sport was never the same. After a 15-year reign over the ring, they made history in 2008, becoming the first brothers in the sport to hold world titles at the same time. Through an engaging mix of candid interviews and absorbing fight footage, Klitschko offers a captivating glimpse into the makings of these champion boxing brothers. But who are these smart gentlemen of boxing, each with a PhD and fluent in four languages? Will Wladimir dominate Heavy Weight Boxing for another five years; and will Vitali, the politician, someday become the President of Ukraine? Will they really stick with the promise they made to their mother, never to fight against each other? -- (C) Corinth</StoryLine>

            <Review>Fawning and generic.</Review>
            <Review>Though this artful film by German documentarian Sebastian Dehnhardt does not stint on inside-the-ring footage, its main attraction is the intense interpersonal dynamic between the brothers.</Review>
            <Review>It's a no-nonsense look at what it takes to become a champion - and what it takes out of a man to hold on to that title.</Review>
            <Review>For those who care about the winning and losing of championship belts, the film's slow-motion attention to pugilistic style and powerhouse punches is thrillingly instructive.</Review>
            <Review>The two-hour pic's lack of economy makes for heavy slogging, with no boxing minutiae too small for exhaustive exposition.</Review>
            <Review>The result isn't quite a puff piece, but it feels like it's building up the brothers' self-approved mythology rather than getting under their skin.</Review>
            <Review>A bit more blood, sweat and tears would have improved the scorecard.</Review>
            <Review>Perhaps more could have been made of the older Klitschko's move into Ukranian politics, now such a hot potato - but that might be asking a bit much.</Review>
            <Review>It's a story that commands attention, even for non-boxing fans.</Review>
            <Review>Great action footage combined with learned interviews. The steely-eyed Klitschkos contrast with the hype and flamboyance of the profession fight scene with amazing impact.</Review>
            <Review>Klitschko at least showcases behemoth athletic champions who are worthy of role model status for reasons other than just their physical accomplishments.</Review>
            <Review>Despite a confusing opening sequence and a disappointingly anticlimactic ending, Klitschko makes for a thrilling boxing documentary.</Review>

            <Review>The story for this revisionist fairy tale, which promotes contemporary attitudes about parenting and gender equality, is less inspired than usual for Pixar, but the movie upholds the studio's high standard of computer animation.</Review>
            <Review>No, not another Pixar classic, but for full-on family fun it's a brave effort.</Review>
            <Review>The story, with its patchwork of plots (involving feuding clans and disastrous spells), holds together enough to thrill intermittently.</Review>
            <Review>Though it falls short of the studio's best in many respects, Brave is ravishing to look at. Merida's carrot corona is alone worth the price of admission.</Review>
            <Review>It still looks great, the scenery coming alive with richly landscaped hills, jagged peaks and crystalline waterfalls, but rarely has it ever been said of a Pixar film that the visuals are the most compelling part.</Review>
            <Review>As a Pixar production, Brave is perhaps lacking in the usual abundance of wit and wisecracks, but in its place is a reservoir of insight into the mother-daughter dynamic.</Review>
            <Review>Everything here is tied together beautifully, at an inimitably comfortable pace.</Review>
            <Review>With all its spunk and determination, it's easy to see how close Brave gets to the bull's eye of Pixar perfection.</Review>
            <Review>Pixar's 13th full-length film is the studio's first to feature a female as its central character, and a memorable creation she is, too.</Review>
            <Review>Brave continues the Pixar tradition of blazing new mythical trails. And Merida is perfect as a princess with no pre-feminist baggage to apologize for.</Review>

            <Review>A film packaged as pure product, aiming to snare the combined markets for loudmouth comics, sci-fi action and, er, Richard Ayoade - who, however seemingly misplaced, is the freshest thing here.</Review>
            <Review>It's a mash-up of blah buddy comedy and gross-out CGI monster splatter, with nary a laugh to be had.</Review>
            <Review>The Watch is a predictable and lazy comedy wrapped around a penis joke occasionally enlivened with some funny lines.</Review>
            <Review>What should have been at least Ghostbusters lite ends up sliming audiences with sloppy seconds.</Review>
            <Review>"The Watch" takes the same ethos of male bonding, obsession with sex and sardonic violence that has proved so profitable in recent years on yet another summer spin.</Review>
            <Review>Improvisation is definitely The Watch-word, with Vaughn and Hill in particular winging just about every line they speak - most of them filthy, few of them funny.</Review>
            <Review>A laughably inept comedic wasteland in which the only things harder to come by than laughs are reasons not to bolt halfway through and ask for a refund.</Review>
            <Review>The four leads are funny, separately and together.</Review>
            <Review>Rote, crass and worst of all, totally laugh-free, it inspires you to exact your own brand of vigilante justice.</Review>
            <Review>Light entertainment at its lightest, The Watch does at least elicit some laughs.</Review>
            <Review>"The Watch" is a Dream Team in which no one's drawn up any plays and nobody passes the ball. Everybody just shoots and hopes for the best.</Review>
            <Review>This lame sci-fi comedy was supposed to be for teens, but was re-written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg to be aimed at adults. The result is a movie that doesn't work for either.</Review>

            <Review>An exercise in compassionate misanthropy.</Review>
            <Review>It would be unfair and patronizing to say that Solondz needs to grow up, but "Dark Horse" suggests that it's time for the bard of bourgeois hypocrisy to consider moving on.</Review>
            <Review>Solondz has made a career out of specializing in highly aberrant views of middle-class life.</Review>
            <Review>That Gelber can make Abe appealing in any way is a triumph. That Solondz can orchestrate such a feat is an even bigger one.</Review>
            <Review>Solondz will never be much for happy endings, but the film is strangely optimistic and at times borders ever-so-slightly on the whimsical.</Review>
            <Review>With champion bloodlines from Walken and Farrow, "Dark Horse" could have been a contender, but it gets so skittish about trodding a familiar path that it pulls up lame.</Review>
            <Review>Acerbic character study.</Review>
            <Review>A typically ineffective effort from Todd Solondz...</Review>
            <Review>Solondz seems to be making a statement about arrested development and the harsh realities of loneliness and age, but it's so clumsily and irritatingly executed that his arguments remain difficult to see.</Review>
            <Review>Age seems to have softened Todd Solondz and it is a real shame, as we have tonnes of optimistic filmmakers but only one of him. Come back, Todd.</Review>
            <Review>"Dark Horse" ends up being a film about loneliness, and the desperate things people will think and do to escape it. And, for once, Solondz doesn't sneer at that desperation.</Review>
            <Review>I honestly can't tell you what connects the various incidents on screen in Act Three. The narrative thread evaporates without a trace, and then suddenly Dark Horse is over ... there was a time I had high hopes for Todd Solondz.</Review>

            <Review>The Island President is an important portrait of a determined man standing fast in a place where the ground is literally shifting beneath his feet.</Review>
            <Review>Climate-change documentaries are almost always disturbing, but "The Island President" communicates a special urgency.</Review>
            <Review>[An] engaging, gorgeously photographed documentary.</Review>
            <Review>Nasheed is indeed inspirational, a cool-headed but passionate and courageous guy. You end up wishing a lot more leaders were like this guy.</Review>
            <Review>Shenk expertly weaves Nasheed's extraordinary personal story together with the Maldives' breathtaking natural beauty and a Capra-esque tale of dogged idealism and political courage to create wonderfully vivid cinematic portraiture.</Review>
            <Review>What makes Nasheed's whirligig tactics so urgent is that, unlike most other countries participating in the summit, his own nation is actually in danger of being annihilated by climate change.</Review>
            <Review>One only hopes that the documentary will help advance Nasheed's mission and inspire others to join arms out of shared ecological concern.</Review>
            <Review>A fascinating look at an extraordinary personality.</Review>
            <Review>The haunting "How to Disappear Completely" plays over the closing credits. If Nasheed isn't able to wake up the world to his country's plight, in a few decades, that could be the new Maldives national anthem.</Review>
            <Review>If you are in a fight, you want this man on your side. He is charismatic, brave and most of all entirely believes in what he is what he is doing. I'm not sure he know the meaning of the word compromise.</Review>
            <Review>As an insight into the cynical nature of world politics, The Island President is wonky but fascinating stuff ... But as a testament to mankind's willingness to change... it's deeply dispiriting.</Review>
            <Review>The film clearly sides with Nasheed's David as he battles Goliath-like businesses and governments, but it never loses sight of the fact that his efforts to preserve the fragile beauty of the sinking Maldives may already be doomed.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Linda White (Rachael Harris), a devoted Christian housewife, leads a sheltered existence in suburban Texas. Her world is turned upside-down when she discovers that her dying husband, Abe, has a 23-year old illegitimate son named Raymond (Matt O'Leary) living in Florida. Somewhere on the edge of guilt and loneliness, Linda grants Abe's final wish and sets off on a quixotic journey to find Raymond and bring him back. Along the way, Linda's wonderfully bizarre relationship with Raymond will teach her more about herself than she ever imagined possible and force her to come to terms with her troubled past. -- (C) Cinema Guild</StoryLine>

            <Review>[Harris is] the one good thing in "Natural Selection."</Review>
            <Review>However gritty this indie comedy may look (cinematographer Steve Calitri seems to be aping William Eggleston's photographs of the American south), it isn't all that different from an Adam Sandler vehicle.</Review>
            <Review>[Harris is] the big reason that "Natural Selection" is so engaging.</Review>
            <Review>In Harris' hands, Linda is guileless but believable, her smile so worn and wary that it almost hurts to see it.</Review>
            <Review>A coming-of-age portrait of a sweet, innocent, middle-aged Christian woman who bursts through the confines of a sexless marriage.</Review>
            <Review>Previously cornered in mousy or sarcastic roles, Harris is challenged by Natural Selection, bringing out the best in the actress, who I hope is offered more juicy dramatic opportunities like this.</Review>
            <Review>Lame indie comedy.</Review>
            <Review>A cracked road trip, marked by a pair of arresting leads turns, shot through with good intention but lacking in either deft enough execution or a tonal commitment one way or another that would tip it toward honest recommendation.</Review>
            <Review>Harris gives it her all, despite Pickering's inability to steer a vehicle worthy of her talents.</Review>
            <Review>A skilful mixture of comedy and drama makes this the kind of film that keeps us off balance from start to finish.</Review>
            <Review>This movie demonstrates that it's a pretty rough place out there in Flyover Land. Harris and O'Leary are up to the challenge, and Natural Selection is a pleasant surprise.</Review>

            <Review>Cheesy but chipper vampire comedy has modest charms.</Review>
            <Review>In an era transfixed by zombies and assorted other ghouls, Vamps is a refreshing change of pace.</Review>
            <Review>"Vamps" is mostly a misfire, but Heckerling still shows enough flashes of wit and wisdom that she remains hard to entirely dismiss.</Review>
            <Review>Vamps sends up our pop cultural fascination with bloodsucking but is itself a bit stiff with rigor mortis.</Review>
            <Review>Aging is probably the real theme here, but it's approached sidelong and has no punch. Still, only the nostalgia has any real conviction.</Review>
            <Review>"Vamps" teeters on the brink of not quite working and yet still routinely lands its laughs.</Review>
            <Review>Evidently made on the cheap, notwithstanding the surprisingly classy cast, Vamps is a bit of a mess, but there's sweetness and wit here, too, making this a movie worth sinking your teeth into.</Review>
            <Review>At times, Heckerling's script feels as though it's been sitting in a coffin, as the film takes on a campy tone with its endless array of anachronistic sight gags and one-liners.</Review>
            <Review>A playful flick about two female vampires, city life and the huge role of screens in our lives.</Review>

            <Review>One can argue the movie's finer points, but in the end, there's no escaping its creeping pile-up of evidence that Mother Earth is critically dehydrated - and we need to do something, fast.</Review>

Dr. Roger Gibson (Charles Hubbell) turns up and admits a long-buried secret: the DNA used to clone David came from the Shroud of Turin -- meaning that the tyke just may be Jesus Christ recreated.</StoryLine>

            <Review>The film would have been so much more interesting if the two men had been identical twins played by the same actor-like Jeremy Irons in David Cronenberg's Dead Ringers.</Review>
            <Review>It all smacks of trying too hard to mask the absence of strong material.</Review>
            <Review>Stone devotes considerable ingenuity to making atrocity appear as a terrifying kind of home movie, but "Savages" is no more than a summertime debauch.</Review>
            <Review>These are neither good people nor interesting savages, and they're not worth caring about. Neither is the movie.</Review>
            <Review>Savages points to a problem with gifted directors, which Stone is, like him or not: They can make a movie that aggravates, infuriates, falters even, but they can really make a movie.</Review>
            <Review>Savages isn't about anything except flashily directed mayhem. In this nest of vipers, it's the slitheriest varieties that survive -- at least for a time.</Review>
            <Review>It's lurid, sexy, funny, chaotic, cluttered, and if the grisly violence turns you off then Blake Lively _ playing a very dumb blonde _ and her two beaus... will also chip in laugh-out-loud moments, all the while with the director winking off-scene.</Review>
            <Review>There's no heft to the material - only mindless violence - and Blake Lively is absolutely dreadful.</Review>
            <Review>Visually dazzling, if a bit bluntly simplistic and over-written. In other words, it's an Oliver Stone movie.</Review>
            <Review>A richly entertaining adaptation of Winslow's novel.</Review>
            <Review>A well-told tale of power, corruption and uncivilized people who use violence and murder to achieve success.</Review>
            <Review>An unabashedly lurid sun-and-surf ménage-à-trois cum drug-running caper, with touches of Jacobean tragedy for good measure.</Review>

        <Duration>84</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Shot clandestinely over a 2-year period by best-selling novelist and filmmaker, Robert H. Lieberman, this film provides a rare look at the second-most isolated country on the planet. It lifts the curtain to expose the everyday life in a country that has been held in the iron grip of a brutal military regime for 48 years. This unique feature length documentary, culled from over 120 hours of striking images, is an impressionistic journey. Interviews and interactions with more than 100 people throughout Burma, including an interview with the recently released Aung San Suu Kyi, are interwoven with spectacular footage of this little seen nation and its people. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>A solid and subtly moving portrait of the people of Burma by filmmaker Robert H. Lieberman.</Review>
            <Review>The film provides one of the ultimate functions of a documentary, taking us into the life and culture of a people most of us would never know.</Review>
            <Review>While "They Call It Myanmar" is certainly more encouraging than previous films on this long-repressed country, fears of persecution continue to loom large.</Review>
            <Review>I've never seen a documentary with more smiling faces.</Review>
            <Review>An incredible, clandestinely shot portrait of underclass life and love [that] also illustrates the gap between populace and regime, which is a dignified goal and achievement.</Review>
            <Review>Lieberman captures the singular human story playing out in the former British colony of Burma/Myanmar where brutality and Karma have been the principle features.</Review>
            <Review>Although owing a bit too much to a Travel Channel episode, this is a valuable look at a country undergoing important and necessary changes.</Review>
            <Review>Above its other admirable attributes, this unique documentary presents a wide scope of the culture and very human side of the unknown land 'quite unlike any you will ever know.'</Review>
            <Review>The images and interviews Robert H. Lieberman and his crew have managed to capture are eye-opening enough to justify the dangerous effort.</Review>

Confined to a frozen cell for centuries, malevolent fox spirit Xiaowei (Xun Zhou) regains her freedom and seeks to preserve her beauty by seducing men and consuming their hearts. Should a man offer her his heart willingly, Xiaowei will become mortal, breaking free of the underworld and experiencing living among the living. Meanwhile, as a dark cloud falls over her kingdom, Princess Jing (Wei Zhao) flees, hiding her deep facial scars under a mask of pure gold while seeking the love of her former protector, who remains haunted by his failure to save her years prior.

            <Review>Aboud has a strong visual sense - the framing is precise, the colours rich - but with a threadbare, episodic plot, thin characters and uninspired dialogue, this soon outstays its welcome.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately, Comes a Bright Day offers insufficient excitement and - like its incompetent robbers - once it battens down those hatches the film has nowhere to go.</Review>
            <Review>[An] ambitious but flawed heist-cum-love story.</Review>
            <Review>Roberts turns in an interesting performance, but the film is treacly and contrived.</Review>

            <Review>A charming and thrilling coming-of-age story packed with impressive performances and a charismatic dialogue.</Review>
            <Review>Aboud summons an impressive array of talent for his debut feature, pitched as an odd mix of indie-Brit parlour farce and Dog Day Afternoon.</Review>

But when Marion's jolly father (played by Delpy's real-life dad, Albert Delpy), her oversexed sister, and her sister's outrageous boyfriend unceremoniously descend upon them for an overseas visit, it initiates two unforgettable days of family mayhem.

            <Review>The laughs come fast and breezy, just as Delpy intends.</Review>
            <Review>While it's nowhere near a perfect film, 2 Days in New York is worth seeing, not only for the comedy but also for the realism of the smaller moments.</Review>
            <Review>[Delpy] and Rock, in the midst of free-flying French chaos, find a sweet chemistry together ...</Review>
            <Review>Much of the alleged humor is based on French-English language gags, or cultural differences or continental mores vs. the priggishness of Americans, but it's all more irritating than funny.</Review>
            <Review>"2 Days in Paris" is as self-assured as it is slight, a deliberate diversion whose winsome charms never run dry.</Review>
            <Review>A manic and funny, if ultimately frustrating, sequel.</Review>
            <Review>Nobody will mistake this for a great comedy, but I enjoyed the madcap looseness and consistently high spirits.</Review>
            <Review>There are a lot of laugh-out-loud scenes, but few hold together well enough to make for a smooth-flowing narrative equal to '2 Days in Paris.'</Review>
            <Review>This very funny, very smart comedy about New York intellectuals meeting a French invasion of sorts is much like a Woody Allen film, but it is written and directed by Julie Delpy.</Review>
            <Review>Rock tries playing it straight, but can't help himself; Delpy is lovably daffy; the film has a breezy, honest air.</Review>
            <Review>I started out thinking this is really forced and then I thought it was really self consciously cute and then I thought it was really unfunny and then I got to the point of hating it and then I wanted her to die.</Review>
            <Review>This is a catastrophically unfunny sequel in which the possibilities for a French-American culture clash are quickly doomed by the cruelly unfunny dialogue and some very bad performances.</Review>

When another young couple-actors Paul (J�r�me Robart) and Elisabeth (C�line Sallette)-joins them on a Roman holiday, tensions and passions flare.

            <Review>While I have to acknowledge Garrel's skill, the film, which actually has its compelling moments, falls somewhat flat.</Review>
            <Review>Garrel's work is indebted to silent cinema style, but his recent films have shown a real flair for dialogue too.</Review>
            <Review>"A Burning Hot Summer" failed to persuade me of any reason for its existence.</Review>
            <Review>There are spirited moments, notably Angèle's torrid dance with another man at a party. But the film's observations are surprisingly retrograde, even absurd.</Review>
            <Review>Here and elsewhere you linger in moments that, like memories and dreams, can feel severed from storybook time.</Review>
            <Review>A Burning Hot Summer wisely knows when and how to surgically slice directly to the bone. It's a bad romance of the highest order.</Review>
            <Review>I have never seen a Garrel film untouched by grace, and A Burning Hot Summer is no exception.</Review>
            <Review>The Louis Garrel character's mixture of self-containment and alleged possessiveness over his wife fails to convince, if not to irritate.</Review>
            <Review>Though shot in swanky color, the film retains the alternately trying and invigorating starkness of the director's recent, black-and-white efforts.</Review>
            <Review>Although Angèle's religious faith and Frédéric's belief in luck seem like strained attempts at adding heft to the material, the film nevertheless works up a potent dramatic restlessness...</Review>
            <Review>This existential-romantic roundelay barely simmers, and certainly doesn't scorch.</Review>

            <Review>Dumbed down, tarted up, and almost shockingly uninspired, it's the worst superhero movie since Green Lantern.</Review>
            <Review>This is a grittier webslinger saga, led by a Peter Parker with swagger and angst and a tone defined more by emotional resonance than wide-eyed wonder. It still has plenty of fizz.</Review>
            <Review>This might be a fun summer blockbuster if only it even remotely needed to exist.</Review>
            <Review>The Amazing Spider-Man is considerably more fun-and, yes, even touching-than so premature a reboot had any right to be.</Review>
            <Review>On the whole, it's passable stuff, a surprise, given how mechanical the masked character seemed.</Review>
            <Review>When (if) this movie comes to mind a few years down the line, I imagine I'll be thinking less about any specific scene than the fact that it has so much wasted potential.</Review>
            <Review>Leaner and meaner with a touch of Bruce Lee, the spider suit's finally right: the eyes dangerous, webbing weaponized. Garfield looks more like the illustrated Peter Parker.</Review>
            <Review>The film is lively because of Andrew Garfield, who makes Spider-Man reckless, dashing, humorous.</Review>
            <Review>"The Amazing Spider-Man" plays things agonizingly safe, and while the film isn't without a heartbeat, its failure to take any chances keeps it from flight.</Review>
            <Review>The Amazing Spider-Man deserves two and a half cheers. Its physics are cartoonish and its metaphysics are nonexistent, but it's a teen-pic with a brain, and that's worth celebrating.</Review>
            <Review>I felt, with this film, that the use of 3D was actually exhilarating.</Review>

        <Title>The Spanish Main</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 1945</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>100</Duration>
        <StoryLine>RKO Radio's first film in the three-color Technicolor process was the standard-issue swashbuckler The Spanish Main. Paul Henried is his usual stoic self as Laurent Van Horn, a Dutch sea captain shipwrecked on the coast of Cartagena, a Spanish-held island. Sentenced to be hanged, Van Horn and his crew escape from jail and take up piracy as revenge against Spain. Soon afterward, they capture a ship carrying Francisca (Maureen O'Hara), the fiance of Cartagena's corrupt governor Don Alvarado (Walter Slezak). Van Horn vengefully forces Francisca to marry him instead, which causes dissension at the Pirate colony of Tortuga. Naturally, Van Horn and Francisca eventually fall in love with each other, but the bad guys must be vanquished before a happy ending can be realized. Binnie Barnes steals the show as feisty female buccaneer Anne Bonney (who in real life looked less like Barnes and more like Walter Slezak!) The script is a cynical melange of pirate-movie cliches and the performances are generally routine, but The Spanish Main pleased the crowd in 1945, posting a profit of nearly $1.5 million and encouraging future Technicolor adventure films from RKO.</StoryLine>

            <Review>It's comforting to watching dramatic and comic fiction regarding the things some of us actually have to deal with in life. When done right, those kinds of films are worth your time. YOUR SISTER'S SISTER happens to be one of them.</Review>
            <Review>Movies that start well and end badly occur often enough, and yet even knowing that is no preparation for what happens to Your Sister's Sister.</Review>
            <Review>It certainly shows that fine films don't need big budgets, capturing some sweet lightning in an arresting bottle indeed.</Review>
            <Review>Romantic, funny, surprising and thoroughly involving, Your Sister's Sister is the rare film you give yourself over to completely.</Review>
            <Review>There's a nice, loose-limbed improvisatory feeling to "Your Sister's Sister," a quality that identifies it as the work of artisans, not assembly-line professionals.</Review>
            <Review>This is a smart, moving film that's also very, very funny.</Review>
            <Review>Even when the story line tries to wrench the characters in a certain direction, they keep returning to something real and honest. I want these people to be my friends.</Review>
            <Review>Don't be surprised if you find yourself nodding off mid-movie, bored silly by a trio of good actors stuck in a dull scenario about a young man caught in a highly implausible kerfuffle involving two sisters and a leaky condom.</Review>
            <Review>It's not rollicking summertime fare, and it won't offer easy answers. But it's an entertaining failure -- just like its characters.</Review>
            <Review>There is some witty banter and some interesting developments. The acting is solid by the three leads.</Review>
            <Review>I think I need a break from Mark Duplass for awhile. At least, from the Mark Duplass who isn't arguing about fantasy football with Ruxin and Taco.</Review>
            <Review>What could have been trite male wish-fulfillment is instead beholden to genuinely messy revelations: life as a tattered, living quilt we sew and wear as one.</Review>

            <Review>Doc captures the superficial appeal of designer's work but offers nothing deeper.</Review>
            <Review>Showing the personal toll that produces a star in any field could be a soggy, predictable drag, but the documentary "A Man's Story" never slides into easy sentiment or bromides.</Review>
            <Review>Vonicos ... misses an opportunity to make a feature-length documentary that takes the full measure of his subject's work.</Review>
            <Review>The result often plays more like a satire of the fashion industry than a serious look at one of the humans inside it.</Review>
            <Review>A Man's Story never gets its man.</Review>
            <Review>Bonicos's documentary on fashion icon Ozwald Boateng nonetheless evinces a minimal amount of interest in digging into what makes its subject tick.</Review>
            <Review>Ozwald Boateng may be the only designer who is more compellingly attractive than any of his models, and this less-than-deep documentary fully captures his undeniable charisma.</Review>
            <Review>The doc does a major disservice to an artiste of fashion with a pretty amazing and prolific oeuvre by reducing him to a Bravo-like personality.</Review>
            <Review>We learn surprisingly little about his work, his development and what shapes his collections.</Review>
            <Review>It may not cut as deeply as you might have hoped but fashionistas will be fascinated.</Review>
            <Review>It's Zoolander without the laughs; a corporate video in the guise of a documentary, unfailingly delighted to let Boateng hold forth on the glory of Boateng.</Review>
            <Review>Anchored by the vibrant Boateng, A Man's Story takes you on an enjoyable, if not tumultuous, ride.</Review>

            <Review>The film's generic, meaningless title is a sign of the dullness to come.</Review>
            <Review>360 is a classic example of how you can't always judge a movie by its credits.</Review>
            <Review>Though the cinematography looks sleek, with shots through windows and in mirrors, split screens and city lights that blur and sharpen, the stories equate to a tangled mess.</Review>
            <Review>Much like its own characters, it dithers too much - and it dares too little.</Review>
            <Review>'360' is classy but utterly amorphous, and that seemingly benign title gives far too much away.</Review>
            <Review>Like the fork that usually comes with your airplane meal, 360 is plastic.</Review>
            <Review>There's one Anthony Hopkins monologue to remember, but that only highlights everything the rest of the film so sorely lacks.</Review>
            <Review>If the film had not been afraid to go a little darker, dig a little deeper and develop its characters beyond their stereotypes, it would have been a much stronger effort.</Review>
            <Review>Spending 111 minutes watching people at the mall would be a more illuminating study of human behavior-and undoubtedly more entertaining.</Review>
            <Review>Fizzles out with a terrible pat ending.</Review>
            <Review>It often feels forced and inauthentic. Perhaps it's a weakness of the direction, but ultimately the film fails to fire up all its many cylinders</Review>
            <Review>Circular exploration of sex, love and relationships, in which interconnected characters reveal how actions, reactions and consequences impact on us all</Review>

            <Review>Trishna engages the potent collisions of the rural and the urban, the poor and the rich, and considers how these interactions unfold in a romance and how they might also destroy it.</Review>
            <Review>While the film never delves deep enough into its characters' emotions to be truly spellbinding, it's well worth seeing.</Review>
            <Review>Winterbottom has complete control of the film's look and feel, but the story seems to run away from him.</Review>
            <Review>A rare unsatisfying swerve from an otherwise reliably provocative career.</Review>
            <Review>"Trishna" works largely on the strength of Winterbottom's clever updates of a century-old story.</Review>
            <Review>A loose but nonetheless pretty faithful recasting of Hardy's penultimate tragedy, Tess of the d'Urbervilles.</Review>
            <Review>Unfocused and easily forgettable, this drama shows that even a likable actress can't carry a movie that undervalues its characters.</Review>
            <Review>Trishna is an admirable effort, but it's too detached and disinterested in the viewer to make an impact. This is a tough film to get through, and even if one makes it to the end, there's little reward to be found.</Review>
            <Review>An intriguing addition to the work of an erratic but always interesting filmmaker.</Review>
            <Review>Hit the books instead.</Review>
            <Review>Things start off promising, but, by the time the final reel rolls, Winterbottom's too-detached style seems to be willfully wallowing in oversimplified misery.</Review>
            <Review>Winterbottom's socially conscious, contemporary adaptation of Thomas Hardy's novel Tess of the d'Urbervilles is first-rate.</Review>

        <Duration>79</Duration>
        <StoryLine>A film director who no longer makes films, Seongjun, arrives in Seoul to meet a close friend. When the friend doesn't show up, Seongjun wanders the city aimlessly. He runs into an actress he used to know, shares a drink with some film students and against his better judgment, heads to his ex-girlfriend's apartment. The next day goes very much like the last; Seongjun meets the actress, has drinks with friends, and falls for woman who looks remarkably like his ex-girlfriend. Each new day plays out like a flimsy copy of the previous one, but only Seongjun knows why. Infused with a playfulness and dry wit that recalls the films of Woody Allen and Eric Rohmer, The Day He Arrives is a delightful meditation on relationships, filmmaking, and the unknowable forces that govern our lives. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>Sang-soo Hong has no profound point to pound home. His story doesn't need an ending. He accepts all the characters just as they are.</Review>
            <Review>Hong abstracts the tense network of fragile relationships to crisp, briskly sketched lines that he adorns with bubbly and self-deprecating humor and graceful wonders...</Review>
            <Review>Hong offers a strange mixture of magic, mystery, rueful melodrama and dry comedy that's like absolutely nothing else.</Review>
            <Review>The movie becomes an exploration, both playful and rueful, of desire, narrative and the idea beautifully expressed by Faulkner in "Absalom, Absalom!" that "maybe nothing ever happens once and is finished."</Review>
            <Review>Even while The Day He Arrives doesn't come to much-at least not in comparison to some of Hong's other films, such as 2006's brilliant Woman On The Beach-it's still time well spent.</Review>
            <Review>The ideas at the heart of The Day He Arrives are worth puzzling over and the discussion to follow may be the real reward, but the experience is muted.</Review>
            <Review>Off-beat romcom.</Review>
            <Review>Hong may be copying a template from his earlier movies about flailing directors (Like You Know It All, Woman on the Beach), but each film is unique, punctuated by occasional zooms that underline the randomness of existence.</Review>
            <Review>The geometry of human relationships is the main theme of The Day He Arrives.</Review>

            <Review>I always forget how funny Hong's films are until I'm in the middle of their deadpan variations on a by now standard theme of immature, self-involved men and accommodating women fooling themselves.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Mikhail Khodorkovsky was once the richest man in Russia. Today, he's one of the world's most famous political prisoners. A story of Shakespearean proportions, The New York Times has reported on Khodorkovsky in both its news and op-ed pages. Fascinating interviews with Khodorkovsky (sometimes sitting in a glass box in the courtroom), members of his family, and others portray a country transformed from its moribund Communist past to one in which power-hungry politicians are abetted by a corrupt, drunken and cynical younger generation. Stark black and white animated sequences help tell an amazing back-story that plays like a political thriller. -- (C) Kino Lorber</StoryLine>

            <Review>Helps to make Khodorkovsky more of a reality than the enigma he threatens to become.</Review>
            <Review>"Khodorkovsky" is a curious and admirable documentary, the product of one filmmaker's inability to let go of a story.</Review>
            <Review>Navigating a tangled tale such as this is like entering a hall of mirrors. "Khodorkovsky" doesn't do a good enough job of Windexing them.</Review>
            <Review>It's a perfect fit for the blend of Greek tragedy, spaghetti Western and judicial farce that defines business and politics in the New Russia.</Review>
            <Review>It's unlikely to enflame American audiences with less of a stake in Russia's political goings-on, but works as a persuasive portrait of a politically toxic situation.</Review>
            <Review>It may be fuzzy around its edges, but inside it's hard as steel.</Review>
            <Review>As Tuschi's film digs deeper, it seems to offer less information. Clearly, many people have been, and still are, affected by this phantom of a subject. This story is not over.</Review>
            <Review>Features frank, informative interviews (including one with Khodorkovsky after his second trial) and raises some important questions.</Review>
            <Review>A documentary that takes fewer prisoners than Putin's KGB, Tuschi's study of Russian power politics is smart, scary and sobering.</Review>
            <Review>Tuschi paints a complex portrait of corrupted power.</Review>
            <Review>This film is a commanding insight into Putin's Russia.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2012</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>100</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Having recently returned to her native Italy after living in Switzerland for 10 years, quiet but curious 13-year-old Marta is left to her own devices while her loving but worn-out mother toils away at an industrial bakery. Marta's only source of socialization is the local church, where she is told to attend preparatory classes for her confirmation. But the doctrines of Roman Catholicism offer little in terms of life lessons or consolation, and she quickly sees through the hypocrisy of the priest, who cares more about status than about his constituents. Eventually, Marta forges her very own way of the cross, which turns out to have much less to do with God than with her own climb towards adulthood. -- (C) Film Movement</StoryLine>

            <Review>For those willing to overlook its few slips into heavy-handedness, "Corpo Celeste" tells a compelling story of a 12-year-old girl thrust into a strange new world.</Review>
            <Review>"Corpo Celeste" often stumbles, along with its 12-year-old heroine, Marta (Yle Vianello).</Review>
            <Review>Alice Rohrwacher's debut fictional feature is an uncommonly insightful portrait of nascent womanhood, assisted in no small measure by Vianello's disarmingly naturalistic performance.</Review>
            <Review>Corpo Celeste would be a treat in any season, but it's particularly refreshing amid the summer-movie bombast.</Review>
            <Review>Vianello gives a lovely, unforced performance as Marta, who begins to see that the blue-eyed, open-armed fuzzy Jesus she's being sold is a fake.</Review>
            <Review>Minor tonal inconsistencies are overcome by this intimate tale's naturalistic thesping and loose lensing style.</Review>
            <Review>Though at times heavy-handed in its imagery and slow-paced, Rohrwacher's debut feature is remarkably unadorned and touching, putting forth a realistic portrait of modern Italy at a time when the country faces economic hardship as well as cultural changes.</Review>
            <Review>A heavenly coming-of-age film.</Review>
            <Review>There are moments that suggest the director might do something better next time.</Review>
            <Review>An accomplished debut.</Review>
            <Review>Neither lights a fuse to our brains or hearts.</Review>
            <Review>Quietly compelling, the cerebral slice of social realism is well worth hunting down.</Review>

        <StoryLine>A firefighter who witnessed a deadly convenience store robbery enters the Witness Protection program, but is forced out of hiding after being targeted for death by the racist crime boss who's determined to see him dead. Jeremy Coleman (Josh Duhamel) was just finishing a long day of work when he ducked into the store for a few beers. Little did he realize his life was about to be changed forever. In the blink of an eye, ruthless white supremacist Hagen (Vincent D'Onofrio) bursts into the store, and guns down the clerk in cold blood. Terrified, Jeremy makes a daring escape amidst a hail of gunfire. Later, Hagan is arrested and police detective Mike Cella (Bruce Willis) takes charge of the investigation. When Jeremy sits down to identify Hagen in the line-up, however, the sociopathic madman reveals that he knows everything about the "anonymous" witness behind the two-way mirror. As Hagan's trial approaches, Jeremy is forced to give up his job to be placed in the Witness Protection program. Meanwhile, he enters into a passionate romance with U.S. Marshal Talia Durham (Rosario Dawson). When Hagan's attorney succeeds in having his client released from prison just weeks before the trial, the killer's henchmen come gunning for Jeremy and Talia. The situation turns critical when Talia is mortally wounded, forcing Jeremy to flee for Long Beach, Ca. Once there, Jeremy realizes that his only hope for protecting Talia is to rally Hagan's enemies against him, and fight alongside them as they aim to take down the vengeful killer once and for all.</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>Corbin Bernsen of L.A. Law and 25 Hill directs this family-oriented comedy starring George Newbern and Megyn Price. Martin Taylor (Newbern) is a dad who has fallen out of touch with his family: his daughter spends time with a group of friends unknown to him, his older son only communicates with the family via a sign on the bedroom door, and his younger son spends hours a day watching faith-themed programming on television. In a drastic move, Martin cuts off all power, water and heat and seals the family up in the home, allowing them no contact with the outside world, in an attempt to bring everyone closer together. In the process, the members of this clan begin to reassess their own priorities and develop a stronger sense of spiritual faith, individually and collectively. ~ Nathan Southern, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>Pray for Japan is a feature length documentary film I began when volunteering in Tohoku, Japan after the earthquake and tsunami tragedy. I shot 40 hours of footage over 5 weeks in Tohoku, interviewing over 30 people - from victims to volunteers. The goal of the film is to share with the world the same inspiration I felt from meeting these real-life heroes. No matter how difficult, how insurmountable was the challenge they faced, these people overcame. The battle to rebuild Tohoku and Japan continues - and the world must not forget their story. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

        <ReleaseDate> 2012</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>90</Duration>
        <StoryLine>In 1965, documentary filmmaker Frank DeFelitta traveled to Mississippi to shoot a film on the subject of racism in the American South. As he went about observing life in Mississippi and interviewing the locals, Frank was introduced to an African-American waiter named Booker Wright. With utter candor and a brazen lack of concern for his own well-being, Booker appeared on tape in the documentary and spoke openly and honestly about the realities of living in a racist society. This brief interview forever changed the lives of Booker and his family, and more than 40 years later, Frank's son Raymond DeFelitta (director of City Island) returns to the site of his father's film to examine the repercussions of this fateful interview. -- (C) Tribeca</StoryLine>

            <Review>Rediscovered historical footage plants the seed for a moving, beautifully crafted Civil Rights doc.</Review>
            <Review>"Booker's Place: A Mississippi Story" is in equal measure a look at two families, the ongoing legacy of America's recent past and an essay on one man's moment of transformative courage.</Review>
            <Review>It's a powerful testament to how far we both have and haven't come.</Review>
            <Review>The film tells a story of another America which seems most primitive, foreign and far away now, but it was really not all that long ago in old segregated, Jim Crow Mississippi.</Review>
            <Review>A heart-felt movie that gives you a good idea of how backward a state is Mississippi.</Review>
            <Review>An interesting and entertaining if often sad documentary inspired by a 1966 NBC special, 'Mississippi: A Self Portrait,' that brought trouble to one of its participants, a popular waiter at a 'whites-only' restaurant.</Review>
            <Review>... [Booker Wright's interview] becomes a window into the life not only of one man, but of a whole culture that, one hopes, lies mostly in America's past.</Review>
            <Review>Clarity is a forte for a documentary. Director Raymond De Felitta has captured a time and place, both past and present, but one wishes he had pushed a bit more for truth.</Review>
            <Review>The exploration of... these issues is precisely what makes the documentary so compelling, and relevant, even half-a-century after the film that inspired it was broadcast.</Review>

            <Review>If they're never fully convincing as photo-realistic figures, they're certainly as much good gory fun to watch as any old-school monster kids had to stick with dreary first acts to see.</Review>
            <Review>Plays like a series of cut-scenes from a 1997 PlayStation game.</Review>
            <Review>Dinotasia is narrated by Werner Herzog with his customary shock and awe.</Review>

            <Review>Werner Herzog's grandiose, unintentionally camp narration adds entertainment value, but there's zero educational sustenance in the film's servings of synthetic gore.</Review>
            <Review>This decision to avoid treating the dinosaurs as surrogate people for easy identification is both the film's boldest move and the source of much of its problems.</Review>

            <Review>The explanations for what has been going on are weird, fantastical and sort of reasonable, within the context of the story, maintaining the film's sense of grounded directness up to the very end.</Review>
            <Review>McCarthy is clearly an economical director and what he gets on screen here - while hardly new - is still effective and occasionally creepy.</Review>
            <Review>A tightly controlled low-budget chiller whose occasional moments of unexpected special effects are set up beautifully by long periods of suspense.</Review>
            <Review>In the end, like a lot of genre movies, this one pulls from different inspirations, and so weighs in, by turns, as overly predictable and satisfyingly recognizable (part of genre cinema's one-two punch).</Review>
            <Review>In truth, there's nothing here we haven't seen before. But McCarthy, who also wrote the straightforward script, keeps the pace moving and the atmosphere eerie (if rarely terrifying).</Review>
            <Review>More horror movies set in the 21st century ought to integrate technology into their scares as well as Nicholas McCarthy's The Pact.</Review>
            <Review>The Pact fizzles out significantly as it marches towards its rather generic final act...</Review>
            <Review>Manages to deliver a decent combination of supernatural and practical horrors.</Review>
            <Review>Nicholas McCarthy admirably tries to deliver both a terrifying tale of horror while mixing in more gritty elements, but doesn't explain much as to why.</Review>
            <Review>Quite easily, one of the scariest films I've seen in a long while... It's a corker.</Review>
            <Review>Debut director Nicholas McCarthy possesses a good grasp of effective, tension-building technique in this psychologically rooted chiller, in which dark, repressed memories of a turbulent childhood bubble to the surface.</Review>

            <Review>With slapstick smothering the scares, "[REC 3]" is further marred by a plot in which the muted Catholicism of its antecedents is turned up to full blast.</Review>

            <Review>Well, bite me, if this movie didn't suck.</Review>
            <Review>Like with the previous films, you can expect lots of blood and gruesome kills, but after a while, you come to the realization that the filmmakers aren't doing anything new with the series, turning this into a rather perfunctory exercise.</Review>
            <Review>...a garden-variety zombie movie that boasts few attributes designed to separate it from its legion of competitors.</Review>
            <Review>A bit short on original ideas, but at 81 minutes, it's difficult to say that it's too long. Some may feel that the humor betrays the mood of first two movies, and that dropping the reality style was a mistake, but I disagree.</Review>

            <Review>This witty, handsomely appointed 3-D animated feature is the most delightful Santa biopic since Edmund Gwenn donned the fat suit.</Review>
            <Review>It's as bright and twinkling as a Christmas tree, decked with warmth and humor.</Review>
            <Review>It's busy but buoyant, and it honors the tradition of giving with wit and style.</Review>
            <Review>The action is swift and witty, and the 3-D effects are imaginative and not simply tacked on as with so many animated movies these days.</Review>
            <Review>The movie fails utterly at coming up with a story that merits all the eye candy.</Review>
            <Review>With a clever script that successfully updates many Christmas myths and dialogue that crackles with sophisticated wit, this movie offers the kind of pre-holiday experience that parents and children alike will appreciate.</Review>
            <Review>Don't go expecting a sequel, but do go expecting all the unforced festive spirit you could hope for.</Review>
            <Review>Parents may shed a nostalgic tear or two, while their children can enjoy spotting all the witty visual details.</Review>
            <Review>Aimed squarely at children, but painless to keep grown-ups from checking their watches.</Review>
            <Review>It's disarming, imaginative and genuinely funny.</Review>
            <Review>The script (co-written by debut feature director Sarah Smith) is fortified with meaning and smarts and plays well for both children and adults.</Review>
            <Review>Arthur Christmas makes a welcome addition to the holiday movie line-up, because it's a movie that one can watch repeatedly without it becoming as stale as last year's fruitcake.</Review>

        <Title>Sinbad the Sailor</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 1947</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>117</Duration>
        <StoryLine>In the RKO swashbuckler Sinbad the Sailor, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. nostalgically emulates his famous father. The first seven voyages of Sinbad have come and gone: now he is on an eighth mission, in search of the island where Alexander the Great allegedly hid his treasure. Participants in the proceedings are the incredibly gorgeous Maureen O'Hara as a feisty princess, Walter Slezak as a duplicitous green-skinned barber, George Tobias and Mike Mazurki as two of Sinbad's faithful seamen, and Anthony Quinn as the villain of villains, who meets a suitably fiery demise. If the plot seems well nigh impossible to follow at times, you can always wallow in the splendiferous Technicolor and the eye-popping stunt work of Douglas Fairbanks Jr. (and, it must be admitted, his uncredited stunt double). Budgeted at nearly $3 million, Sinbad the Sailor was one of the few postwar RKO flicks to post a profit.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Although it canters down a well-trod path toward a predictable finish line, The Cup sustains interest through the smooth efficiency of its storytelling and the engaging performances of its lead players.</Review>
            <Review>It's a very decorous picture in which a sense of conflict is largely lacking.</Review>

            <Review>I found The Cup to be a pleasant-enough viewing experience. At the same time, I was never as riveted as I have been by other, similarly-themed films. It makes you feel good without ever truly stirring the soul.</Review>
            <Review>One wonders who the audience is for a film this far removed from the dirt and grime of the reality it claims to be based on, and why they find anything so squeaky-clean appealing.</Review>
            <Review>Director Simon Wincer, who also co-wrote the screenplay, was not the right person to avoid certain temptations, like dunking the audience's noggins into a honey pot of clichés.</Review>
            <Review>The hybrid feel of it all works, and the inevitable uneven moments didn't bother me, nor did the odd story cliché.</Review>
            <Review>The script by Wincer and Eric O'Keefe is a maudlin mess right from the word go, and if any film this year has been filled with more treacle-laden melodrama I certainly have not seen it.</Review>

        <Title>Night of Dark Shadows</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 1971</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>97</Duration>
        <StoryLine>This is the second full-length motion picture feature based on the popular television soap-opera/horror melodrama Dark Shadows. The first film was House of Dark Shadows. This film lacks the grand guignol glee provided by Jonathan Frid and Joan Bennet. However, it has a new storyline, not a rehash of one previously explored in the television series. Here, artist Charles Collins (David Selby, who performed the same part in the TV series) brings his new bride to live in the family mansion, which he has just inherited. The gentle and sensitive young Collins, the last of his clan, has troubled sleep. He dreams of the past, of his family, and of the house. Perhaps his dreams are not just dreams? Increasingly deranged by these visions, it begins to look like he will re-enact the atrocities committed by his family in the past. It is interesting to note that the film uses the mansion of 1890s railroad robber/baron Jay Gould for its setting.</StoryLine>

        <Duration>52</Duration>
        <StoryLine>The ill-fated coal mining communities in North East England are the subject of this inspired documentary by multi-media artist Bill Morrison. Their story is told entirely without words, yet the film is far from silent: it features a remarkable original score by the Icelandic composer J�hann J�hannsson. Using rarely-seen footage from the British Film Institute, the BBC, and other archives, The Miners' Hymns celebrates social, cultural, and political aspects of the extinct industry. Focusing on the Durham coalfield located in northeastern England, it depicts the hardship of pit work, the role of Trade Unions in organizing and fighting for workers' rights, the years of increased mechanization and the annual Miners' Gala in Durham. -- (C) Icarus</StoryLine>

            <Review>Scenes of the director as a school-age boy in a Varda film are haunting, but end up simply sparking a desire to see Varda's work. It may take time for the son to catch his own wave.</Review>
            <Review>Demy leans heavily on a cinematic legacy that also seems to hold him back.</Review>
            <Review>The wounded characters eventually slouch toward redemption; the movie they're in, however, isn't nearly as lucky.</Review>
            <Review>...if you can't get past the flaws, you could always rent it just to see Salma's exotic dance number.</Review>
            <Review>A film with a compelling story (though far too dependent on a single character) fails to move its audience, even as its own scenes somehow fail to move their protagonist.</Review>
            <Review>This odd hybrid of in-search-of-mother quest and lurid border-town pulp shows a humane intimacy mostly in touches borrowed from the filmmaker's estimable parents.</Review>

            <Review>[O]ne of the best based-on-facts police pictures.</Review>
            <Review>Whatever you think of it, you won't be neutral.</Review>
            <Review>Bluntly edited, with no hand-holding transitional scenes, the film is an intimate portrait of an idealistic, understaffed, sometimes wrongheaded team battling youth prostitution, thievery rings and adult predators from every class of society.</Review>
            <Review>"Polisse" draws us uncomfortably close to a taboo subject then rewards us with real nourishment.</Review>
            <Review>Has an infectious energy and aims for a bottom-up, slice-of-life air characterised by naturalistic performances and a fly-on-the-wall shooting style.</Review>
            <Review>It's messy, boring, funny, suspenseful, touching, jubilant and tragic.</Review>
            <Review>It has the makings for a pretty good cop show. But as a movie, this 'inside' look at the dozen or so dedicated members of the Parisian Child Protection Unit is conspicuously lacking in coherence and depth.</Review>
            <Review>It gets across its message on the plight of the innocent children.</Review>
            <Review>The French drama is a gritty and intimate look at big-city detectives that had me wondering what the French word for "wire" is.</Review>

            <Review>Polisse connects fitfully through its sheer urgency -- it's a work of deep feeling. But the movie, which opts for a baseline emotional setting of overheated, eventually starts to come across as pummeling, and one-note.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2012</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>109</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Winner of Cannes' Un Certain Regard Special Jury Prize, Elena is a gripping, modern twist on the classic noir thriller. Sixty-ish spouses Vladimir and Elena uneasily share his palatial Moscow apartment-he's a still-virile, wealthy businessman; she's his dowdy former nurse who has clearly "married up." Estranged from his own wild-child daughter, Vladimir openly despises his wife's freeloading son and family. But when a sudden illness and an unexpected reunion threaten the dutiful housewife's potential inheritance, she must hatch a desperate plan.... Masterfully crafted by award-winning Russian filmmaker Andrey Zvyagintsev (Golden Globe nominee The Return) and featuring evocative, Hitchcockian music by Philip Glass, Elena is a subtly stylish exploration of crime, punishment and human nature. -- (C) Zeitgeist</StoryLine>

            <Review>Sturdy performances, fine photography from Mikhail Krichman, good use of music by Philip Glass and a pleasingly terse script make for incisive, gripping drama.</Review>
            <Review>In different hands, "Elena" might have been a noir thriller, but this serving of cinematic borscht is as cold as a Russian winter.</Review>
            <Review>"Elena" is a riveting psychological suspense film.</Review>
            <Review>A quiet, subtle mystery whose long, penetrating takes have drawn comparisons to Andrei Tarkovsky and whose mordantly ironic conclusion may remind you of Claude Chabrol.</Review>
            <Review>Zvyaginstsev makes the most of the ghastly settings, which include a backyard that ominously features nuclear cones - and the kinds of compartmentalized living spaces that Hitchcock used for droll effect in "Rear Window."</Review>
            <Review>It's a sort of slow-boil Russian noir, if that genre exists, and if it doesn't, it does now.</Review>
            <Review>A chilly noir about the beaten paths and icy ruts of Russian life in the capital, post-Communism. In a land of schemers, Elena suggests, the urban cloisters of Moscow's elite are as self-sealing as the lowly masses' stifling Soviet-era flats.</Review>
            <Review>The kind of family drama that gives family dramas a good name.</Review>
            <Review>Though very Russian, there is an extremely universal story at the heart of this film ...</Review>
            <Review>A perfectly formed drama that gradually takes hold and doesn't let go.</Review>
            <Review>It's very gloomy. It's very Russian. It's as powerful as any picture released this season.</Review>
            <Review>Elena is beautifully accessorized with clean, elegant camerawork by Mikhail Krichman, and a compelling score from Philip Glass. But if a movie's story doesn't grab you, the accessories are just wrapping around a disappointing gift.</Review>

            <Review>Sometimes it's worth surrendering to cinematic enchantments, and Ruby Sparks makes a pretty good case for its own magic.</Review>
            <Review>Sure it's been done before -- man brings ideal woman to life -- but not quite like Ruby Sparks. And that sets this film up to be a smart and romantic low-key comedy that goes beyond expectations.</Review>
            <Review>If the result feels like a Pinocchio story that spends too much time with Geppetto, or a takedown of narcissism that never breaks free of what it's critiquing, Dano nonetheless makes Calvin compelling company.</Review>
            <Review>Kazan winds up indulging in the very wish-fulfillment she initially sets out to deconstruct.</Review>
            <Review>Ruby Sparks flirts with preciousness and has less fun with its premise than it could have, but that's because it's actually a gently touching metaphorical drama about the real essence of love.</Review>
            <Review>Ruby Sparks might have been more fun if Cal were written to be expansive instead of a worrywart in the middle-aged Matthew Broderick mode.</Review>
            <Review>Ruby Sparks is a good little cute 'n' clever (dare I call it... quirky?) movie, and it's possible that the degree to which I'm frustrated with it is solely due to the fact that I hoped for something different, something more.</Review>
            <Review>"Ruby Sparks" is a uniquely palatable concoction - part Woody Allen, part John Hughes, part Rod Serling.</Review>
            <Review>There's no shortage of interesting ideas submerged here. Too bad it's such a slog to sit through.</Review>
            <Review>Ruby Sparks is an honest, entertaining, and insightful picture that, despite a very 'filmy' happy ending, offers up an amusingly frank deconstruction of the 'dream girl' idea that pervades much modern fiction.</Review>
            <Review>Having established this whimsical dream-come-true situation, the film now sneakily subverts it.</Review>
            <Review>Kazan the writer asks a lot of Kazan the actress, putting her through an emotional wringer while also calling upon her to convincingly traverse a path from happiness to humiliation without missing a beat. She seldom disappoints.</Review>

            <Review>What these dog days of political campaigning needs is a good, sharp political satire. Alas, The Campaign is not that movie -- not even close.</Review>
            <Review>Simply taken as a broad character comedy, "The Campaign" definitely has its moments.</Review>
            <Review>It's way over the top, but then again, so are most modern political campaigns. Lots of funny s--- here.</Review>
            <Review>[A] very raunchy and sometimes pretty funny comedy - which isn't above going for dumb jokes, but is also smart enough to play to its two stars' strengths.</Review>
            <Review>This movie is single-handedly causing a major rise in our mirth deficit. It's so bad, I'm declaring a laugh emergency.</Review>
            <Review>The leads do fine work, but the screenplay bizarrely reduces Ferrell to straight man for much of the film.</Review>
            <Review>It's the most infuriating kind of comedy, one that keeps flirting with sharp ideas, only to retreat into barn-door-broad buffoonery.</Review>
            <Review>It even has something like a brain with awareness of the world outside the film, and that is too rare of a commodity in American film comedy in the 2010s.</Review>
            <Review>You keep waiting for the movie to say something, to find that extra level of inspiration we've seen each of these two guys reach. Or at least to justify making a political comedy in the first place.</Review>
            <Review>It is meticulously bipartisan in its ridicule, from the right's embrace of God and guns, to the left's disingenuous stance against fat cats and big money.</Review>
            <Review>The problem with situation comedy movies in general - and Will Ferrell vehicles such as The Campaign in particular - is that they usually fizzle out after the first 30 minutes.</Review>

        <StoryLine>In a time when America's economy and sense of community were crumbling, one guy left everything behind - to see if he could survive solely on the support of the 21st century's new town square: Craigslist. As of recent, the United States found itself in one of the most precarious financial meltdowns in modern history. It was in this climate that 29-year-old Joseph Garner cut himself off from everyone he knew and everything he owned, to embark on a bold adventure. Armed with only a laptop, cell phone, toothbrush, and the clothes on his back - alongside the hope that community was not gone but just had shifted - Joe lived for a month looking for alms in America's new town square: Craigslist. For 31 December days and nights, everything in his life would come from the Craigslist website. Would America help Joe? -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

        <ReleaseDate> 2010</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>77</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Right now, across the country, our two major political parties are gearing up for a once-a-decade war whose winner will control Congress for the next ten years, and possibly more. There will be battles in every state, and each will be kept carefully hidden from the prying eyes of average voters who only become more disenchanted with their government with each meaningless election. Democrats and Republicans collude to keep these skirmishes private so that they can maintain total control over the ultimate political weapon: the ability to directly determine the outcome of elections. Why bother stuffing ballots when they can just draw districts?</StoryLine>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>The film's basic premise -- why can't politics be a reasonable, logical enterprise (like, say, making an indie documentary?) -- is at odds with the realities not just of the American political process but also human nature.</Review>
            <Review>It jumps around from California to Texas to Iowa to Louisiana and back, quite literally all over the map, with lots of numbingly repetitive cartographic visuals.</Review>
            <Review>An illustrated civics lesson that strains to make its complicated, shadowy subject -- electoral redistricting -- a political hot topic.</Review>
            <Review>Maybe the whole topic is just too esoteric to warrant feature-length dissection without a craftier firebrand like Michael Moore at the helm.</Review>
            <Review>While the film adopts a sometimes jaunty tone, the fact is that gerrymandering is bad news, assuming you believe that elections should mean something.</Review>
            <Review>If we stipulate that gerrymandering is a pox on the American political process, do we have to sit through a documentary that makes that case in the most earnest, predictable way possible?</Review>
            <Review>Reichert has to come up with some way to draw us in, and does so, for the most part, with some very entertaining, shocking and dastardly tales of gerrymandering to the extreme</Review>
            <Review>The film's final statement is literally, "end gerrymandering,' which is hardly non-partisan itself.</Review>
            <Review>Reichert for the most part succeeds with a subject that's hard to get excited about.</Review>
            <Review>Works fine as civics instruction but it won't move the needle against this decidedly anti-democratic process.</Review>
            <Review>An important political subject gets sincere but slick treatment</Review>
            <Review>unable to clearly and succinctly identify the problem it has wrapped its eighty-odd minutes of thinly-developed footage around</Review>

        <StoryLine>We first meet Fanny, an obsessive-compulsive who lives in a group home and works at a candy factory about to go bankrupt. Fanny brings this secret to the Christmas dinner, where she reconnects with her self-absorbed sister Annie and their too-perfect-to-trust brother Danny. Mother Edie hosts the party with an iron fist, insisting at an ever-increasing pitch that everyone have fun. Their Vietnam vet father may act like his emotions died with his friends on the battlefield, but director Brown continually lets his audience glimpse the last few pulses of compassion the broken man has for those around him. As with a storm building strength silently offshore, we sense the impending climax without knowing exactly when or where it will hit - or how hard. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>"Fanny, Annie &amp; Danny" may be an unpleasant story about unpleasant characters, but the acting is fabulous.</Review>
            <Review>The more difficult characters here (all female) and resulting character dynamics are so consistently shrill that the pic feels a bit too one-dimensional and cruel to leave the small-tragedy aftertaste it could have.</Review>
            <Review>Mostly the movie just gets off on how awful and/or pathetic its characters are, calling on the viewer to judge or pity rather than sympathize with its gallery of grotesques.</Review>
            <Review>Fanny, Annie &amp; Danny will make anybody with a family, the more dysfunctional the better, cringe and grin.</Review>
            <Review>I left the film feeling horrible for or about the characters onscreen, but it doesn't mean this is a bad movie; it's a really great movie, just not a feel-good movie.</Review>
            <Review>A superbly orchestrated screenplay, astonishing performances and riveting direction from San Francisco filmmaker Chris Brown deliver a family drama with darkly humorous riffs</Review>
            <Review>Fanny, Annie &amp; Danny will make you run up and hug your sketchiest uncle this holiday season. Family dysfunction at its finest.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director Chris Brown obviously loathes Christmas, and that's just fine with us, especially as that hostility has resulted in such a dark and funny film.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>The violence quickly becomes numbing, and Benjamin Walker plays Lincoln without the sense of irony needed to keep the historical and supernatural sides of the story consistently entertaining.</Review>
            <Review>The movie plays safe by cutting every theme down the middle - a swing that's effective when splitting wood or vampire skulls, but dull when applied to filmmaking.</Review>
            <Review>Of course it's ridiculous and tasteless and grotesque. It's ABRAHAM LINCOLN, VAMPIRE HUNTER.</Review>
            <Review>The disconnect between intention and final product is a head scratcher.</Review>
            <Review>Bekmambetov doesn't expect us to take the premise seriously, exactly. But he doesn't seem to want us to laugh at it, either.</Review>
            <Review>Bekmambetov ... stages hilarious, imaginative, almost free-form action sequences like nobody in the business.</Review>
            <Review>Rare is a film this silly that's also this quietly clever.</Review>
            <Review>Somehow, you can't help but feel vampires deserve better.</Review>
            <Review>Rather than create an innovative style to complement the horror-history hybrid, he employs superhero clichés and hackneyed action scenes that only help distract from the ineffectiveness of the film's scant 3-D effects.</Review>
            <Review>If you thought the American Civil War was about ending slavery, you're in for a rude surprise.</Review>
            <Review>Succeeds in being an entertaining, exciting, and chilling genre hybrid</Review>
            <Review>As a tongue-in-cheek action mashup, Grahame-Smith and Bekmambetov have, for the most part, delivered an entertaining (albeit campy) historical retelling.</Review>

            <Review>Take This Waltz is a Remarkable, Offbeat Love Story</Review>
            <Review>A hard-headed, generous film about love.</Review>
            <Review>Polley (who's been an actress herself) never judges these people she's created. Instead, she depicts the giddy, fleeting and illusory nature of new love, and lets us get caught up in it, too.</Review>
            <Review>No one's a cliche; no one speaks dialogue the viewer could have muttered a beat or two ahead of the movie; no one hews to a mode of behavior fabricated to explain away his or her irrational behavior.</Review>
            <Review>[It] often feels thin and self-conscious.</Review>
            <Review>Williams lives and breathes her role, Kirby is charming and real, and you actually start to ache and empathize with Rogen - the emptiness and heartache he conveys when Lou and Margot finally thrash things out is crushing.</Review>
            <Review>It's such a strange little movie but beautifully acted and undeniably fascinating.</Review>
            <Review>Sexually charged, frank, and relatable, Take This Waltz is a bittersweet observation of adult romance.</Review>
            <Review>[A] sunny dramedy that lulls its viewers with pseudo quirks, but which actually hides an altogether terrifying dead heart that clubs viewers over the head with its nauseating examination of an insufferable, unhappy woman.</Review>
            <Review>While hardly a complete failure, 'Waltz' nevertheless finds Polley dancing to the beat of a simmering romantic triangle with two left feet.</Review>
            <Review>This is finely-judged filmmaking from a writing and directing talent to watch.</Review>
            <Review>A mess of the sort that only a brilliant person can slop up on there.</Review>

            <Review>The story is loaded with implausibilities, but it moves so quickly you won't have long to dwell on them, and there are a number of neatly executed reversals.</Review>
            <Review>It's fast, lean, satisfying, and forgettable; nothing special, really, until you realize that the movies have largely lost the knack for brisk mayhem like this.</Review>
            <Review>The sort of stripped-down, Francophone picture that's been spoiling American action fans over the last few years. There are no Cuisinarted fight scenes, no pauses for awkward romantic subplots.</Review>
            <Review>Charging from one beating to another, wrenching diminishing returns from drunken camera angles and cat-and-mouse games, Mr. Jardin makes Vincent's predicament as hollow as a sustained scream.</Review>
            <Review>This tense French thriller never goes anywhere new, but nonetheless keeps up an admirable adrenaline kick till the end.</Review>
            <Review>Sufficiently diverting yet predictable enough to be just the perfect fodder for genre cinema enthusiasts.</Review>

            <Review>Soderbergh has created a spicy yet lucid, surgingly high-energy yet smartly modernistic musical.</Review>
            <Review>Tatum, whose talents have been the subject of debate, also makes Mike genuinely affecting, not to mention articulate within the bounds of a sketchy script.</Review>
            <Review>Does a better job of mixing Chippendales-style guilty pleasures with reality-based cautionary tales than you might expect.</Review>
            <Review>The dance numbers, choreographed by Allison Faulk, are inventive and athletic, but not really erotic; Soderbergh never lets you forget that, for these men, dancing is above all a job.</Review>
            <Review>Magic Mike has a conventional structure, yet a teasing question percolates beneath: If selling yourself is as much fun as this movie makes it look, what could be wrong with it?</Review>
            <Review>If you're looking for a romance with 100 percent prime beefcake? Get your singles out and ready, ladies. "Magic Mike" is in the house.</Review>
            <Review>[A] perfect storm of marketability and smart, inventive avant-garde cinema - a resourceful character piece built upon a cacophony of cinematic contrast.</Review>
            <Review>Once you get past the thongs, the uniforms, and the sleek choreographed stripping dance routines -- admittedly, the main attraction of Magic Mike for most audiences -- it's just another day at the office for Steven Soderbergh</Review>
            <Review>The sexy mischief and the darkness and the earnest character beats all fit together in one terrifically entertaining, perfectly pitched success.</Review>

            <Review>At the very least, the message it communicates is benign, mostly because it does not clearly possess any sort of message.</Review>
            <Review>The story is slight, but the gentle humour and mild suspense will keep young viewers engaged, and the animation provides its own magic, particularly in the moments when Tink sets foot inside the Winter Woods and her wings gain a shimmering iridescence.</Review>
            <Review>The brightly-coloured visuals and frenetic story ensures this is little more than a cinematic stocking filler.</Review>
            <Review>A worthy message, quietly delivered.</Review>
            <Review>Harassed parents of daughters will probably buy the DVD.</Review>
            <Review>Everything about this 3D animation released on the "Disney Fairies" label (don't laugh) screams straight to video, or perhaps chirps it.</Review>
            <Review>A sweet, safe bet to entertain young girls over Christmas.</Review>
            <Review>A solid entry in the Tinker Bell franchise that will play well to its target audience of pre-teen girls and won't feel like too much of a chore for dragged-along adults ...</Review>
            <Review>The film is ... confident tackling real issues - global warming, prejudice - yet never patronises while maintaining a determinedly child-friendly vibe.</Review>
            <Review>It's professionally crafted fluff, disposable as chewing gum, but likely to hit the spot for the specific female primary-school age-group the film is aimed squarely at.</Review>
            <Review>Even if fairies stories tend to be formulaic - fairy is happy, fairy gets in trouble, fairy gets out of trouble and learns a lesson - this one introduces the bold-ish concept of the sisters' bond rather than the usual marriage plot.</Review>

            <Review>An entirely predictable script that chugs along to the foregone loser-beats-odds conclusion.</Review>
            <Review>In another era, "Crooked Arrows" might have been an after-school special, perfect to have on the TV while cleaning the house; miss a scene while you're dusting under the couch, and you'll still know exactly what's happening later.</Review>
            <Review>"Crooked Arrows" gets points for its glimpses of Native American culture and history - the film's backers include the Onondaga Nation - but too many of these scenes are disappointingly static.</Review>
            <Review>"Crooked Arrows" might involve two lesser-seen screen subjects - Native Americans and lacrosse - but it still can't break free of the usual underdog sports picture tropes.</Review>
            <Review>Routh ... does a killer Tom Cruise-in-"Jerry Maguire" homage in this swift little sports dramedy.</Review>
            <Review>A millennial brace of lacrosse action propels Crooked Arrows through a thicket of cliches liberally planted in its path.</Review>
            <Review>It's a warm-hearted little movie. It may have a ton of Native American cinematic clichés-dream sequences with staccato wooden flutes, soaring eagles, and so on-but it works.</Review>
            <Review>This attempt at a drama is pretty routine, but it demonstrates why some clichés became clichés: because they work. [It's] basically The Bad News Bears without all of the humor, though the tone is still fairly light.</Review>
            <Review>It's The Mighty Ducks for lacrosse and it works.</Review>
            <Review>These aspects provide the film with a novel focus, even though all of its events are entirely predictable.</Review>
            <Review>The lack of anything distinctive in execution or performance makes the film instantly forgettable.</Review>
            <Review>It has charm and a refreshing cultural perspective, but the predictability is often too much to bear, tanking the potential for a proper big screen exploration of lacrosse.</Review>

            <Review>This is an exceedingly promising directorial debut for Scafaria, who adapted the winning romance Nick &amp; Norah's Infinite Playlist.</Review>
            <Review>The genuine sweetness of the friendship that develops between these two wins out over any of the movie's failings.</Review>

            <Review>Could there be a more opportune time for this topic? Will that pack 'em in the theaters? Not likely. It's hectic while lacking tension, thus paradoxically ending up both irritating and boring simultaneously.</Review>
            <Review>Carell could have given the performance of his life (he doesn't), and the film would have remained a cliché-ridden mess with a narrative built on convenience and coincidence.</Review>
            <Review>There's an entire world out there that's about to end, and this movie zooms in on the two least interesting people in it.</Review>
            <Review>Carell possesses a knack for these comedic-tinged dramatic parts, subtly layering on the pathos while slyly exploiting his character's vulnerability.</Review>
            <Review>A certain generosity of spirit is required here, but the performances are excellent and the central premise ... is a solid and amusing one.</Review>

            <Review>Interview after interview, statistic after statistic, Dick's advocacy project thoroughly incenses -- and appears to be having results.</Review>
            <Review>This travesty has been encouraged by a military culture that blames the victim and a policy directing soldiers to refer complaints to their commanding officer, which typically results in no action or even reprisals against those speaking out.</Review>

            <Review>Where this picture is truly triumphant, is within the significance of its very existence. This film simply needs to have been made, and it needs to be seen.</Review>

            <Review>At film's end, you'll probably feel like having a long, hot shower, metaphoric or otherwise, to wash away the mire Brügger has presented.</Review>
            <Review>[Brugger] returns with a jaw-dropping exposé of postcolonial corruption; he's lucky he returned with his head.</Review>
            <Review>You can imagine how this could have become a 1950s British comedy. It is all real.</Review>
            <Review>'The Ambassador" is a sociopolitical prankumentary in which the prank blows up in the filmmaker's face, exploding-cigar style.</Review>
            <Review>The picture sometimes seems to have been assembled rather than creatively edited.</Review>
            <Review>A stunning, funny, and vital piece of guerilla cinema.</Review>
            <Review>Brügger seems very taken with his own cleverness-his too-cool-for-school attitude suggests that his ultimate aim is really to amuse himself.</Review>
            <Review>A wild, darkly comic slice of nonfiction branded 'performative journalism' by its creator. Ballsy, attention-grabbing and a lot of fun for anyone with an interest in matters geopolitical.</Review>
            <Review>Supposedly nothing is staged. Truthfully, so much of this film is stranger than fiction, it would require pure writing genius to come up with even a third of what transpires.</Review>
            <Review>Taken as satire, this isn't particularly funny - but then, the corruption he's exposing is anything but a joke.</Review>
            <Review>Brügger recalls gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson, who once went undercover with the Hell's Angels. Brügger has similar intentions, and mostly he succeeds. If only he had Thompson's way with words.</Review>
            <Review>Give Brugger points for audacity and for a caustic wit that produces some solid laughs, yet the result isn't quite as eye-opening as perhaps he intended.</Review>

        <Title>Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2012</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>70</Duration>
        <StoryLine>In 1995, during the making of his TV series Triumph of the Nerds about the birth of the PC, Bob Cringely did a memorable hour-long interview with Steve Jobs. It was 10 years since Jobs had left Apple following a bruising struggle with John Sculley, the CEO he had brought into the company. At the time of the interview Jobs was running NeXT, the niche computer company he had founded after leaving Apple. During the interview, Jobs was at his charismatic best - witty, outspoken, visionary. In the end, only a part of the interview was used in the series and the rest was thought lost. But recently a VHS copy was found in the series director's garage. Now, cleaned up with modern technology, and put into context by Cringely, the entire interview will be screened in Landmark Theatres. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>Lazy storytelling expects a pass as indie authenticity.</Review>
            <Review>There's a big difference between commenting on the zeitgeist and simply acknowledging it, as this featherweight independent comedy demonstrates.</Review>
            <Review>This is a small film and knows exactly how to be a small film. Like many New Yorker short stories, its purpose is to strike a particular note and allow it to reverberate.</Review>
            <Review>Even at a lean 73 minutes, this flimsy road movie feels at least 43 minutes too long.</Review>
            <Review>Small, Beautifully Moving Parts isn't always completely elegant about getting its point across, but its imperfections are only human - a quality, as Sarah eventually realizes, that can have its own appeal.</Review>
            <Review>"Small, Beautifully Moving Parts" is a tiny, sweet gem.</Review>
            <Review>The film is true to its title: small, beautiful and moving.</Review>
            <Review>Highly agreeable, funny and bright study of a pregnant woman all at sea in a world where wireless options seem to outweigh human ones in her life.</Review>
            <Review>An intimate and well-acted drama about the technological tools in our lives and the quest of a young pregnant woman to reconcile with her long estranged mother.</Review>
            <Review>Gentler and less aesthetically assaultive than 0s &amp; 1s and Catfish, but it's not necessarily any subtler or more enlightening.</Review>
            <Review>Unfortunately, its tale is so slight and simple that it ... fails to say anything particularly poignant about life.</Review>
            <Review>The film would be better if it were gentler. It's broadly written and played, the actors too busy telegraphing their characters' emotions to let us contemplate their faces in peace.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Uptight is an updated remake of John Ford's The Informer (35). The Irish Republican rebels of the original are replaced by black activists, Dublin becomes the Cleveland ghetto, and "the troubles" of 1921 are transformed into the days just following the assassination of Martin Luther King. Julian Mayfield plays an itinerant street sweeper who betrays his militant friends to the fuzz, resulting in an underground all-points bulletin to exact vengeance on the squealer. Ruby Dee portrays a prostitute who befriends the snitch as he eludes his revolutionary ex-buddies. Jules Dassin's unrelenting directorial pace is complemented by the driving jazz score of Booker T. Jones. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>The Australian outback, the setting for most of Last Ride, an extraordinary film for which the locale is a quiet, almost secret catalyst.</Review>
            <Review>The title more or less gives away the film's design, but the predestined journey is taut and tragic nevertheless.</Review>
            <Review>Both Weaving and the movie itself do manage to show that this violent, hopelessly damaged man yearns to be a father, but will never know how.</Review>
            <Review>Mr. Ivin doesn't have a strong narrative line to play with or become distracted by, but he takes off on some lovely detours, whether he's narrowing in on Chook or going wide to take in the world that waits beyond.</Review>
            <Review>Weaving, best known for The Matrix and the Lord of the Rings trilogies, brings subtlety and poignance to the hoodlum's mercurial character.</Review>
            <Review>Ivin's film, based on a novel, becomes too melodramatic and bleakly obvious. Weaving, though, as always, is never less than magnetic.</Review>
            <Review>Weaving carries the film in a rare lead role as a father who loves his son but has criminal tendencies that get the best of him. Tom Russell is subtle and effective as the boy who has to grow up fast.</Review>
            <Review>There were some clear issues with the story and characters that really needed to be addressed well before the cameras started rolling, but unfortunately director Glendyn Ivin and screenwriter Mac Gudgeon didn't do so.</Review>
            <Review>While the basic premise of the film is something of a cliché, the execution is nuanced and the two lead performances are never less than convincing.</Review>
            <Review>This curiosity about the main character -- and his major crime (which is revealed gradually) -- creates and maintains the lovely, looming suspense of Last Ride.</Review>
            <Review>The remarkable landscape of Australia's outback [and] Weaving's paternal to scary on a dime performance makes [it] much more than a depressing story about an abusive father.</Review>
            <Review>Despite its strong visual sensibility and performances, Glendyn Ivin's film gives into contrivance in its final act.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Liza Minnelli is Pookie Adams, a relentlessly kooky coed in The Sterile Cuckoo. The film's focus, however, is on Wendell Burton (likewise making his first screen appearance) as reserved young college student Jerry. He is actively pursued by the unpredictable Pookie, who helps him to survive his first months in school. Gradually, however, it is obvious that Jerry is outgrowing Pookie. Both, however, have benefited from the relationship (he has gained self-confidence, she is now able to come to grips with her unhappy home life) and their parting is a tender one. Not unlike his stars, Alan J. Pakula was making his directorial bow with The Sterile Cuckoo, which earned an Oscar nomination for its theme song "Come Saturday Morning." ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi</StoryLine>

Then, on one sunny day, their perfect world is irrevocably shattered . Leaving their five year old son, Ben, alone for only a moment, Craig is horrified to see him being abducted from their own front yard.

            <Review>Its clichés grow slightly funny. But not funny enough to make the endless torture scenes bearable.</Review>
            <Review>[It] suggests only that ferreting out new ways to inflict pain requires more imagination than anyone on hand realized.</Review>
            <Review>Ugh.</Review>
            <Review>It's a revolting horror film that wastes the talents and good looks of Erika Christensen and Jesse Metcalfe in favor of severed penises and other violent atrocities performed on a kitchen table.</Review>
            <Review>The torture-porn label would stick if wasn't so hard to imagine anyone getting much out of it.</Review>
            <Review>The flick gets off on surgical slicings and an overall Fincheresque gloominess, the latter becoming an unwitting joke.</Review>
            <Review>A stupendously inane and pointless slice of revenge-based horror whose title might as well describe the audience watching it.</Review>
            <Review>The title is an apropos description of audiences who sit through this inept low-budget psychological thriller, which would be considered tasteless if it weren't so incompetent.</Review>
            <Review>Robert Lieberman's Perverted Justice advert spins its wheels with scene after scene impatiently cut like a montage sequence.</Review>
            <Review>It's an angry picture, but that dependable sense of rage doesn't carry through to the end. Instead, the effort dissolves into a strange genre predictability.</Review>
            <Review>No amount of plucked-off fingernails are going to fill this empty vessel with any semblance of a point.</Review>
            <Review>A serviceable genre entry that is, admittedly, destined to leave non-horror fans absolutely cold.</Review>

        <Title>Neil Young Journeys</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2012</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>87</Duration>
        <StoryLine>In May of 2011, Neil Young drove a 1956 Crown Victoria from his idyllic hometown of Omemee, Ontario to downtown Toronto's iconic Massey Hall where he intimately performed the last two nights of his solo world tour. Along the drive, Young recounted insightful and introspective stories from his youth to filmmaker Jonathan Demme. Demme, a long-time fan and collaborator, captured these tales of Young's childhood and masterfully weaved them together with his mesmerizing music including songs from the 2010 album Le Noise and powerful renditions of classics including "Ohio", Hey Hey, My My", "I Believe in You" and previously unreleased songs "Leia" and "You Never Call." Through the tunes and the tales, Demme portrays a personal, retrospective look into the heart and soul of the artist. -- (C) Sony Pictures Classics</StoryLine>

            <Review>On its own terms, "Neil Young Journeys" is an enjoyable concert film of a solo show in Toronto, interspersed with memories of his Canadian boyhood.</Review>
            <Review>"Journeys" is simply a trip most need not take.</Review>
            <Review>I'd say the movie does a fine job of completing the trilogy, but I wouldn't be surprised if Demme and Young have more in them yet.</Review>
            <Review>The concert camera work is sometimes a little tight for comfort (not really interested in Young's bridge work), though it adds to the intensity.</Review>
            <Review>Like Young, Demme often takes an iconoclastic route. This is in part a concert film, yes, but not a traditional one.</Review>
            <Review>Forget Crosby, Stills and Nash and maybe even Crazy Horse. Jonathan Demme might be Neil Young's ultimate collaborator.</Review>
            <Review>Count me in the camp that wouldn't mind another Young/Demme movie every two or three years from here on out.</Review>
            <Review>Young's amiable, guard-down chatter as he drives that 1956 Ford Crown Victoria all the way from Omemee to Massey Hall in Toronto establishes a sense of heart and soul ...</Review>
            <Review>Demme plants a camera on the mic stand so at one point he can present Young's unshaven scowl in extreme close-up, blocking out the gorgeously lighted stage. It's not a pleasant image</Review>
            <Review>It's OK. But seriously, how many Neil Young documentaries do we need?</Review>
            <Review>A mournful documentary that combines footage of Young in concert in Toronto with a bittersweet trip to his childhood home in Omemee in southern Ontario.</Review>
            <Review>Demme hasn't stopped seeking out new angles on this old warhorse, and even the odd speck of spittle on the lens cannot obscure the fact Young increasingly looks and sounds like one of the all-time greats.</Review>

            <Review>The film shows us trenchantly that law often lags behind deep-grained custom.</Review>
            <Review>[A] low-key tale of life in rural Albania.</Review>
            <Review>A memorable portrait of a society and the demands it makes on those caught up in it.</Review>
            <Review>We don't see any blood, or much forgiveness either, but we do witness something far more resonant - a young generation caught between the rock of tradition and the hard place of modernity.</Review>
            <Review>A heartbreaking Albanian film that counts the toll a family feud takes on all involved.</Review>
            <Review>The leads -- both non-actors -- hit sharp, natural notes.</Review>
            <Review>The fascinating pic is filled with eye-pleasing location shots.</Review>
            <Review>It's a searing portrait of a dangerous generational divide that ruins lives, told with a gentle touch.</Review>
            <Review>Has an earthy whiff of authenticity. But it's seriously lacking in incident and dramatic drive. Admirable work by British cinematographer Rob Hardy, though.</Review>
            <Review>A slow but totally authentic-looking film with an excellent cast, not all of whom are professionals.</Review>
            <Review>Joshua Marston hops on another subculture - Albanian blood feuds - and operates sensitively once again in the space between 21st-century ethnographer and enlightened genre director.</Review>
            <Review>The plot comes to a quiet boil. Then unfortunately it falls off the stove.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>The film is frequently funny, always elegant (or mock-elegant), and something that would make Humbert Humbert laugh all the way to his asylum.</Review>
            <Review>Most of Wes Anderson's previous pictures came from the head; Moonrise Kingdom is one from the heart.</Review>
            <Review>Anderson never loses his core themes - young love, the need to escape, the bind and bluster of family. His "Kingdom" may not be large, but it is perfectly appointed.</Review>
            <Review>Phonies may complain that Anderson's island of misfit toys is a retreat from the real world, but for pure-hearted adventurers who share the secret map, "Moonrise Kingdom" is a joy that cannot be eclipsed.</Review>
            <Review>Though undeniably smart and charming, "Moonrise Kingdom" loves itself the way the callow Holden Caulfield loves himself: unconditionally. Salinger understood the problem with that. Anderson may not.</Review>
            <Review>"Moonrise Kingdom" takes place in a world where everything seems pleasantly faded, where people read crackly-covered library books rather than e-books, and where young people are allowed to be genuinely innocent.</Review>
            <Review>'Moonrise Kingdom' magically recreates a child's-eye view of the early 1960s, bringing back memories of tents, tree houses, campfires, cub scouts, innocence, and first kisses.</Review>
            <Review>It is no insult to tag Wes Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom as "charming" or "enchanting." Those qualities, sadly missing in this vertigo-inducing era of big screen alien invasions and superhero exploits, are here, three times filled and overflowing.</Review>
            <Review>This is the work of an auteur - confident, but understated; beautiful, but heartbreaking; intoxicating, but sobering.</Review>
            <Review>It's funny, it's playful, it's full of nostalgic blasts and period trappings, but most of all it is loving: accepting of the headstrong kids determined to find their place in the world...</Review>
            <Review>The script may be the film's greatest strength: the movie is probably Anderson's most quotable.</Review>
            <Review>Moonrise Kingdom may be a light summer entrée, but it rewards us by serving up a rich romantic fantasy and isn't afraid to share its sweet, beating young heart.</Review>

But when an enemy from their past reenters their lives, hard-hitting Kyra Lee (Rachel Boston) decides she isn't going to take his abuse anymore. Her friends soon find themselves fumbling accomplices in a dark kidnapping plot, which none of them are sure they can pull off. With the stakes rising, they discover that their biggest obstacles might not be the gangster waiting for them in Vegas, the sheriff knocking on their door, or the man tied up in their garage, but rather, a decades worth of hidden rivalries, buried emotions, and dark secrets between best friends.

        <StoryLine>Rousseau is a bestselling crime novelist from Paris, troubled by writer's block. Candice Lecoeur is a local beauty, gracing the famous "Belle de Jura" cheese packaging, who has gotten it into her head that she might well be the reincarnation of Marilyn Monroe. The two will meet in the coldest village in France, but only after Candice has been found dead. The case was closed before it even opened and the cause of death declared suicide by sleeping pills. Rousseau is the only one who doesn't buy it. Reality turns out to be stranger than fiction - and a source of inspiration - as Rousseau uncovers the truth about Candice's past and her untimely death. Boasting strong lead performances and gorgeous wintertime landscapes, this off-beat mystery breathes fresh life into the thriller genre. -- (C) First Run Features</StoryLine>

        <Title>Running with Bulls</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2012</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>51</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Presented by UK journalist Jason Farrell (Sky News) Running With Bulls captures and explores the thrills, passion and controversy of the Pamplona Bull Run. The San Fermin Festival in Pamplona, Spain is a celebration of life, of shared history, of family and religion. It is a fiesta like nothing you'll ever experience anywhere else in the world and one reason for this is the famous spectacle of the bull run. Each morning for seven days, six fighting bulls tear through the narrow streets while thousands of thrill-seeking runners sprint alongside them to test their skills and courage. However, each afternoon, the same fighting bulls are ritually slaughtered by Matadors in a stadium of 20,000 people. For those who care about animal welfare but also respect long-held traditions, the festival throws up quite a moral dilemma. After experiencing it, three things can happen: either you fall in love with the opera of the spectacle, or you detest it to your core, or you are tugged both ways. Through this film the narrator attempts to see the festival from all perspectives: the runners, the protesters and the bulls themselves. The film follows the journey of six fighting bulls from their countryside ranch in southern Spain, to the outskirts of Pamplona and then on their run through the cobbled streets to the stadium's Gate of Fear. Along the way we meet many characters who are all very passionate in their reasons for being involved. But despite the popularity of the festival, we're asked whether it can and should survive in today's world in this fascinating and in-depth portrait of atradition that is both loved and loathed.</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>Seductive, fearless, and outrageous, Marina Abramovic has been redefining what art is for nearly forty years. Using her own body as a vehicle, pushing herself beyond her physical and mental limits--and at times risking her life in the process--she creates performances that challenge, shock, and move us. Through her and with her, boundaries are crossed, consciousness expanded, and art as we know it is reborn. She is, quite simply, one of the most compelling artists of our time. -- (C) Music Box Films</StoryLine>

            <Review>"She's never not performing," says one friend. And the documentary, "Marina Abramovic: The Artist Is Present," confirms it.</Review>
            <Review>Briskly edited and brightly shot.</Review>
            <Review>In place of evenhandedness, the film gives us a full sense of a personality and intelligence so riveting that we begin to comprehend why all those hundreds of thousands lined up at the MoMA.</Review>
            <Review>Abramovic is raw and likeable, if mostly inscrutable.</Review>
            <Review>The film's centerpiece is the retrospective devoted to Abramovic at the Museum of Modern Art in the spring of 2010.</Review>
            <Review>The film goes a long way to establish the intellectual seriousness and dedication involved in her ambitious series of art stunts.</Review>
            <Review>It's a shame that the people who really need to see Matthew Akers' transfixing debut documentary, Marina Abramović: The Artist is Present, won't go near it.</Review>
            <Review>Like any good documentary, ""The Artist Is Present" gives insight into the life and work of a truly talented lady. Her works may not be for all tastes she but obviously has an audience if MoMA is any indication.</Review>
            <Review>...for the 2 1/2 month run of the [MoMA] show, Marina would sit completely still in a chair as visitors cued up to sit across from her and look into her eyes. The effect is incredibly and unexpectedly moving.</Review>
            <Review>It demonstrates how cinema can actually make the artist seem present, offering an empathetic fellow consciousness that mirrors one's soul.</Review>
            <Review>If you have been looking for the natural meeting place of Jafar Panahi's document of life under house arrest This is Not a Film and Justin Bieber's popumentary Never Say Never, look no further.</Review>
            <Review>An exhilarating, elegantly executed film that holds a mirror up to the art world, its protagonists and its devotees, forcing us to question the whole circus.</Review>

            <Review>Its increasingly preposterous narrative and hysterically over-violent action makes it something of a guilty pleasure.</Review>
            <Review>Transit delivers little of value, and never with a smile.</Review>
            <Review>Entertaining, fast-paced, pulpy thriller enlivened by colourful performances, a decent script and a hefty dose of violence, though it mysteriously neglects a couple of obvious opportunities and has the occasional unintentionally laughable moment.</Review>

            <Review>Isn't satisfying as a whole, with exciting pieces of the production hinting at a stronger film under a different creative direction.</Review>

        <Title>2016: Obama's America</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2012</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>87</Duration>
        <StoryLine>2016 Obama's America takes audiences on a gripping visual journey into the heart of the world's most powerful office to reveal the struggle of whether one man's past will redefine America over the next four years. The film examines the question, "If Obama wins a second term, where will we be in 2016?" Across the globe and in America, people in 2008 hungered for a leader who would unite and lift us from economic turmoil and war. True to America's ideals, they invested their hope in a new kind of president, Barack Obama. What they didn't know is that Obama is a man with a past, and in powerful ways that past defines him--who he is, how he thinks, and where he intends to take America and the world. Love him or hate him, you don't know him. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>The film is a sleepy dud, a polemic that, like D'Souza himself, is at once both outrageous and deeply boring.</Review>
            <Review>The movie seems destined to irritate the president's supporters while mobilizing his detractors, even as it is doomed to win precious few converts. It's a textbook example of preaching to the choir.</Review>
            <Review>No one doubts that the country faces major challenges in the next four years, but there is one safe bet: The future is unlikely to be affected by this simplistic documentary.</Review>
            <Review>Viewers may do some headscratching. This can be a very strange movie.</Review>
            <Review>Every anti-Obama argument D'Souza makes from the right could be made, more forcefully, from the left.</Review>
            <Review>D'Souza's demented anti-Obama crusade feels personal more than political.</Review>
            <Review>This is neither printing the facts nor printing the legend: it's printing the flop sweat.</Review>
            <Review>2016: Obama's America comes to seem like clownish alarmist speculation taking place in an echo chamber of talking heads.</Review>
            <Review>D'Souza never actually shows...Obama's own words or deeds. Instead, he engages in guilt by association.</Review>
            <Review>So Obama is bringing socialism to America by 2016? That would explain why Bain Capital is making bigger donations to him than to its founder Mitt Romney.</Review>
            <Review>As questionable as right wing D'Souza's lack of unbiased assertions, is the seeming lack of anyone out there who can rise above being either a red state or blue state movie critic, when it comes to political documentaries in such a divided nation.</Review>
            <Review>The film flutters to the ground like so much GOP convention confetti, all assertions, few facts and little substance other than the conspiratorial right wing talking points that are D'Souza's bread and butter.</Review>

            <Review>Surprisingly mean-spirited from start to finish.</Review>

            <Review>Vulgar, tasteless, mean-spirited and most offensive of all--not funny.</Review>
            <Review>There is nothing creative, amusing, valuable or interesting about Sandler's work. That's My Boy isn't the worst film I have ever seen; it's just one of the saddest and most exhausting.</Review>
            <Review>This crude and unfunny comedy is easily the worst movie of 2012.</Review>
            <Review>Yet again Adam Sandler has taken a fairly clever concept for a broad comedy and just detonated it with some of the stupidest, most repetitive gags imaginable.</Review>

        <Duration>95</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Chely Wright: Wish Me Away is the story of Chely Wright, the first country music star to come out as gay. Over three years, the filmmakers were given extraordinary access to Chely's struggle and her unfolding plan to come out publicly. Using interviews with Chely, her family, her pastor, and key players in Nashville interwoven with Chely's intimate private video diaries, the film goes deep into her back story as an established country music star and then forward as she steps into the national spotlight to reveal her secret. Chronicling the aftermath in her hometown of Nashville and within the larger LGBT community, Wish Me Away reveals both the devastation of her own internalized homophobia and the transformational power of living an authentic life. -- (C) First Run</StoryLine>

            <Review>The unshakable support of her religious sister, the raw and heartfelt stories of her childhood: These are the moments most likely to provide the inspiration she hopes to share.</Review>
            <Review>While it's fascinating to observe the workings of the mammoth apparatus grafted onto an intensely personal decision, the movie's heart is the moments that take place in private.</Review>
            <Review>'Wish Me Away' is not just another doc on coming out; it's a unique story from a brave woman whose truth was more important than fame and glamour.</Review>
            <Review>Worthy if at times heavy-handed doc about the first country-music star to publicly say, "I'm gay."</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately too concerned with courting the singer's fans to deliver anything more than a theatrical release of a very special episode of VH1's Behind the Music.</Review>

            <Review>By honestly telling her story country western star Chely Wright has made a powerful, unforgettable coming out story stripped of melodrama yet unexpectedly heartbreaking.</Review>

        <Duration>81</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Based on the story by Paul Gallico, Lili stars Leslie Caron as the title character, a 16-year-old waif who runs off to join a carnival. Embittered, crippled puppeteer Mel Ferrer treats Lili with contempt; only by speaking through his puppets is Ferrer able to express his genuine love for the girl. Before this happens, however, Caron must overcome her crush on magician Jean-Pierre Aumont, who is married to the contentious Zsa Zsa Gabor. Though not a musical (as was Carnival, the 1961 Broadway version of Lili), the film affords Leslie Caron the opportunity for a dream ballet, and also accommodates the lilting Bronislaw Kaper/Adolph Deutsch hit song "Hi Lili, Hi Lo". Legend has it that professional curmudgeon H.L. Mencken, who considered movies a waste of time and never bothered to see them, was persuaded to attend a showing of Lili--and loved every minute of it!</StoryLine>

            <Review>Rock of Ages is not a spoof, but it might as well be, given how little there is to root for.</Review>
            <Review>...a cinematic endeavor that, for all intents and purposes, is asking the consumer to put down his or her money to watch movie stars do karaoke.</Review>
            <Review>Cruise, as Stacee Jaxx, is the living embodiment of a rock god.</Review>
            <Review>Every time an actor belts out a hit, you're reminded that the original, however cheesy, was better.</Review>
            <Review>The movie's supporting stars are always, inevitably, winking at the audience, but it's unclear whether the dewy-eyed leads even know how to blink.</Review>
            <Review>Pour some sugar on it, indeed.</Review>
            <Review>"Rock Of Ages" is a soundtrack in search of a story, but it turns its utter disregard for narrative into its strongest ally.</Review>
            <Review>...the two hours watching such a tepid and lip-synched effort is not a pleasant experience.</Review>
            <Review>I know that in the history of cinema there have probably been worse movies. I'm just having a hard time thinking of one right now.</Review>
            <Review>Oscar-worthy costume design by Rita Ryack ... enliven the proceedings that are constantly mired by Tom Cruise's unattractive vanity mugging, off-putting gay jokes and questionable taste in choreography.</Review>
            <Review>Rock of Ages will make you want to raise your arms...and then immediately plunge your fingers into your eyeballs for salvation (you can go back for seconds to rescue your ears).</Review>
            <Review>Feelin' the noise ain't the same as feeling something for the characters, most of whom fail to amp it up in the soul department.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2012</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>91</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Four years into her biochemistry Ph.D. program at Harvard, Samantha still cannot replicate the results she achieved in her first few weeks in the program, and her charmingly neurotic tendencies are turning into a serious control problem. Her anxiousness extends beyond her lab work and into her relationship with long-term boyfriend, Ben. When Ben proposes marriage, Sam panics, worried that their relationship "data" is inconclusive. Insisting that she cannot have faith without proof, Sam decides to perform a "control experiment" for her relationship - to see other people and collect "dating data." When Sam discovers that outside sources may be meddling with her data - and also with Ben - she must take control of her life once and for all. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>Losing Control nicely mixes comedic absurdity with weightier career vs. commitment themes.</Review>
            <Review>Perhaps investigating something new would have better served Weiss than simply looking to her own experiences, exploring rather than settling.</Review>
            <Review>Weiss's ideas about moviemaking, storytelling, and character development are indistinguishable from bargain-bin romantic comedies (so-called chick flicks) and television shows that barely last a season.</Review>
            <Review>[Kent is] the least credible scientist since Denise Richards donned short shorts to play Dr. Christmas Jones.</Review>
            <Review>While Losing Control is a thoroughly likable, playful comedy, there's never a sense that writer-director Valerie Weiss is in total command of film's tone, pacing or comic content, which is considerable.</Review>
            <Review>Science-themed rom-com isn't ready for clinical trials.</Review>
            <Review>Losing Control a film experiment gone wrong</Review>
            <Review>The tone and pacing and even the characters are inconsistent, but still writer/director Valerie Weiss gives the film some wit, some humorous situations, and a refreshing dash of real science.</Review>
            <Review>With its labored parade of polygamists, neurotic Jewish parents, and projectile semen explosions, Control offers nothing new. This one should have stayed in a test tube.</Review>
            <Review>Clumsy, awkward, unfunny indie rom-com about a grad-student scientist trying to quantify whether or not she's really in love.</Review>
            <Review>The film, in its defense, is far too vacuous to be accused of having any kind of agenda-it just happens to get its politics wrong along with everything else.</Review>
            <Review>The tepid indie feelgood romcom follows a too familiar formulaic storyline to hold my interest.</Review>

            <Review>A Cat in Paris is thrilling, and a thrilling example of traditional ink and paint cartooning.</Review>
            <Review>[It] glories in striking silhouettes, a slinky '50s beat, a bright storybook palette and an entrancing brand of make-believe that grown-ups can believe in.</Review>
            <Review>An animated delight, and certainly not just for kids.</Review>
            <Review>"A Cat in Paris" has a jazzy, relaxed beauty; it's old-school, hand-drawn animation, and you sense the fun the artists were having.</Review>
            <Review>At a little over an hour, it's a slight but visually charming adventure.</Review>
            <Review>Like a cat nap, it gives us a brief, refreshing dream with little to remember.</Review>
            <Review>...has a delightfully idiosyncratic animated aesthetic - it's like an intermingling of Art Deco and Cubism - but the story is all odd angles</Review>
            <Review>In this chase film, children's love of pursuit, of running and jumping and hiding and seeking, transforms the City of Lights into a playground where even a mother bounds along car roofs to reach her daughter. The story, though, lags behind the animation.</Review>
            <Review>This French import is a welcome (read: hand-drawn as opposed to CGI) movie that packs a lot of punch in its hour-long running time.</Review>
            <Review>It's a fun and exciting film that both kids and adults can enjoy.</Review>
            <Review>Come for the film, stay for the urban-mural visuals, leave vaguely satisfied.</Review>

            <Review>Mr. Dosunmu seems to have directed all his actors to pause before delivering lines, giving a languor to the film that comes to feel studied.</Review>
            <Review>In its portrait of a "Restless City" the film is strangely inert and feels like the work of image-makers, not storytellers.</Review>
            <Review>Told in an elliptical style with a pacing and jagged rhythms that take some getting used to, the thrust and power of the film lies in its poetic imagery...</Review>
            <Review>Restless City looks gorgeous, but has nothing to say.</Review>
            <Review>Inviting and intriguing in its beauty, grit, and danger, familiar yet foreign.</Review>
            <Review>Violent episodes explode and recede, but without context and emotional connection, they're sometimes just pictures.</Review>
            <Review>The script simply isn't in the same league as the images that Andrew Dosunmu and the gifted cinematographer Bradford Young have fashioned.</Review>
            <Review>Forget pimps, it's apparently just as hard out there for a street peddler.</Review>
            <Review>Beautiful but inert, Restless City is like a grimy lost verse of Jay-Z's 'Empire State of Mind' -- a film concerned with locating the quiet nobility in hand-to-mouth existence, and celebrating struggle for self-betterment via dollar bills, y'all.</Review>

            <Review>Prometheus is scary only in the sum of instincts and talent for movie-making that have been lost.</Review>
            <Review>The movie may be a scare show that leaves many questions unanswered, but Scott's craft earns an exhausted kind of respect.</Review>
            <Review>While I was completely engrossed in 'Prometheus', I felt a tug-of-war going on between the cerebral and visceral elements, right up to the finale.</Review>
            <Review>Brilliant. Epic. Haunting. Grotesque. Great.</Review>
            <Review>The setup is familiar-the mysterious planet, the slick tunnels, the shocking bodily violation, the broken quarantine, etc. So why is there a gaping hole where the dread should be?</Review>
            <Review>Prometheus tells a much bigger story and does it well, but it's missing what matters most. It's inorganic.</Review>
            <Review>Scott tries not to remake Alien and attempts instead a mini-Kubrick, a muddled Tarkovsky, perhaps an Asimov, or even the recently-departed Bradbury. But old habits, and slimy beings, die hard.</Review>
            <Review>The best-looking stupid movie I've seen all year. It's sumptuously photographed, and often inane.</Review>
            <Review>Many walked into this movie expecting a science fiction thriller in the vein of Ridley Scott's original Alien. This, I feel, was a colossal mistake.</Review>
            <Review>It is easily the most cerebral endeavor of its kind since "Minority Report."</Review>
            <Review>Any lack in originality is handsomely compensated by the plethora of 3D visual treats courtesy of a crackerjack technical crew that creates an eerie interplanetary moonscape that's as epic as it is requisitely foreboding.</Review>
            <Review>WPrometheus offers hypotheses about the origin of life on our planet that are so well constructed, they make real-life theories about extraterrestrials seem highly feasible.</Review>

            <Review>It lingers intolerably on some inessential scenes, rushes through others, and fails to provide any motivation either for Poe's devoted (albeit fictional) love, or the film's archvillain.</Review>
            <Review>Never commits to the kind of full-bore lunacy that might have made the film a campy pleasure.</Review>
            <Review>The subject matter screams out for cleverness and depth, the sort of mind-bending twists and satisfying darkness that Poe himself would love. It finds them only in small doses.</Review>
            <Review>Director James McTeigue has no feel for humor or terror, making what could have been a witty pastiche into another cheesy slice-and-dice horror flick.</Review>
            <Review>It's 'Saw' meets 'Sherlock Holmes.' "</Review>
            <Review>CSI: Nevermore.</Review>
            <Review>A crudely written and wholly uninspired thriller that's unlikely to win anyone over to the horror master's oeuvre.</Review>
            <Review>The Raven is a movie with its wings clipped; a murder mystery that feels strangely subdued.</Review>
            <Review>The problem is that "The Raven" is all surface. The movie is nothing but its fun idea, without much development or ingenuity</Review>
            <Review>Even though this film has more than its share of dark, gruesome elements, there is also enough of a sense of playfulness in it to help make it entertaining.</Review>
            <Review>I'd say that nine bucks is probably also the current going rate for Livingston &amp; Shakespeare's next script.</Review>

        <StoryLine>A monstrous creature terrorizes a 19th Century European village by moonlight and a young man struggles to protect his loved ones from an unspeakable scourge in Werewolf: The Beast Among Us, Universal Studios' all-new addition to its time-honored legacy of classic monsters. During his studies with the local doctor (Stephen Rea), Daniel (Guy Wilson) witnesses the horrific consequences of werewolf attacks. Watching as the beast's fearsome reputation draws bounty hunters, thrill seekers and charlatans to the tiny town, Daniel dreams of destroying the ruthless predator. So when a mysterious stranger (Ed Quinn) and his team of skilled werewolf hunters (Stephen Bauer, Adam Croasdell) arrive to pursue the monster, he offers to join them, despite his mother's (Nia Peeples) protests. But it soon becomes clear that this creature is stronger, smarter and more dangerous than anything they have faced before. As casualties mount and villagers see their neighbors transformed into ravening monsters, the townsfolk take up arms against each other to find the true identity of the werewolf. Amid the hysteria, Daniel begins to suspect he's closer to his target than he ever dreamed.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Just because the main characters are in a constant state of depression and angst doesn't mean the audience should have to wallow in their misery as well.</Review>
            <Review>The film seems to aim for a gritty and real depiction of a drug- and drink-fueled not-quite romance, but it's in fact just your worst fears about the kinds of people who populate L.A. brought to ugly, misogynistic and sometimes maudlin life.</Review>
            <Review>The only audience likely to respond favorably to this vanity production about the slow, painful self-discovery of a rich, young Hollywood filmmaker would be other rich, young and screwed-up Hollywood filmmakers. But even they might be put off.</Review>

            <Review>The Giant Mechanical Man has the heart of a smart, sophisticated indie rom-com with wacky supporting players swiped from your average Kate Hudson clunker.</Review>
            <Review>A solid summer palate cleanser to savor between all those main courses of superhero wham-a-thons.</Review>
            <Review>This cute dramedy tackles well-trod ground in the world of indie film but Lee Kirk conveys enough honest affection for his well-crafted characters that the piece works.</Review>
            <Review>The only thing creakier than the title character in this low-budget romantic comedy might be the script.</Review>
            <Review>Jenna Fischer and Chris Messina generate sweet chemistry together as two lonely people who find each other during stressful times in their lives.</Review>

The catch is delivering it to a killer as elusive as a nightmare and so feared the entire Underworld trembles at the mention of his name. But The Courier (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is no ordinary carrier. In a business that asks no questions he's the best there is, and with the life of his only friend held to ransom there's no way he's missing the drop, come hell or high water.

He is even less enthused about joining the town's high school basketball team, especially when he begins to bump heads with the team's star player, Lucas.

Michael's faith is tested as he endures confrontations with Lucas on and off the basketball court and through his growing fascination with Jasmine, Chase's longtime girlfriend. With topics including peer pressure, alcohol, sex, suicide, relationships, and acceptance, New Hope captures the life of the modern teenager.</StoryLine>

        <Duration>105</Duration>
        <StoryLine>On April 2nd, 2011, LCD Soundsystem played its final show at Madison Square Garden. LCD frontman James Murphy had made the conscious decision to disband one of the most celebrated and influential bands of its generation at the peak of its popularity, ensuring that the band would go out on top with the biggest and most ambitious concert of its career. The instantly sold out, near four-hour extravaganza did just that, moving the thousands in attendance to tears of joy and grief, with New York Magazine calling the event "a marvel of pure craft" and TIME magazine lamenting "we may never dance again." Shut Up and Play the Hits is simultaneously a document of a once-in-a-lifetime performance and an intimate portrait of Murphy as he navigates both the personal and professional ramifications of his decision. -- (C) Oscilloscope</StoryLine>

            <Review>"Shut Up" is graceful in its depiction of the performance, neither uncomfortably intimate nor shy.</Review>
            <Review>Murphy is one hell of a frontman, and LCD Soundsystem is a deliriously exciting concert act.</Review>
            <Review>Shut Up and Play the Hits manages to effectively display the power of that final concert while putting the band's leader into thoughtful cultural perspective.</Review>
            <Review>If you've never heard of LCD Soundsystem or cared much for the group's work, "Shut Up and Play the Hits" still manages to explore the prospects of fame and contemporary rock music's lasting relevance.</Review>
            <Review>A must for fans of LCD Soundsystem and about fifteen minutes too long for anyone else, this is an entertaining enough exploration of walking away from success and fear of failure.</Review>
            <Review>a penetrating and moving documentary that captures what was weird and special about Murphy and his band, and was extra weird and special about his decision to kill the band.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Marine Corps Master Sgt. Jerry Ensminger was a devoted Marine for nearly twenty-five years. As a drill instructor he lived and breathed the "Corps" and was responsible for indoctrinating thousands of new recruits with its motto Semper Fidelis or "Always Faithful." When Jerry's nine-year old daughter Janey died of a rare type of leukemia, his world collapsed. As a grief-stricken father, he struggled for years to make sense of what happened. His search for answers led to the shocking discovery of a Marine Corps cover-up of one of the largest water contamination incidents in U.S. history. Semper Fi: Always Faithful follows Jerry's mission to expose the Marine Corps and force them to live up to their motto to the thousands of soldiers and their families exposed to toxic chemicals. His fight reveals a grave injustice at North Carolina's Camp Lejeune and a looming environmental crisis at military sites across the country. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>Jerry Ensminger isn't an environmental or public health crusader as much as a grieving father.</Review>
            <Review>Pic forges a clear storyline through a sea of scientific reports, doublespeak denials and personal anecdotes (the docu snagged Tribeca's docu editing award), and a consistent picture emerges of a stonewalling military agency.</Review>
            <Review>It makes an impact. These men fought for our right to pursue our own American Dreams. And as thanks, they had theirs ripped away from them.</Review>
            <Review>Shot on a variety of affordable video cameras, from the older HD standard Sony EX1 down to the classic Panasonic DVX100, Semper Fi has a very intimate visual look.</Review>
            <Review>Beyond heartbreaking are scenes of afflicted Marine families and workers at Camp Lejeune giving testimony to a corporate-biased panel, who seemingly couldn't care less. And what the Tea Party and GE may have to do with all of this, but aren't talking.</Review>
            <Review>Semper Fi: Always Faithful carefully follows the conduct of this case, which is largely unknown by the general public. It is superbly constructed without being preachy.</Review>
            <Review>A damning documentary about drinking water contaminants at a military training base spanning a period of 30 years that is at once emotionally powerful and a little more under-sketched than one might like it to be.</Review>
            <Review>Master Sgt. Jerry Ensminger is the kind of person, you come to see in Semper Fi: Always Faithful, who takes the Marine Corps' credo utterly seriously.</Review>
            <Review>Riveting. More than worth an investment of time and money on the part of both military personnel and civilians. One of the five best documentaries of 2011.</Review>
            <Review>As a political act, Semper Fi hews closer to the spinelessness of your average elected Democrat.</Review>
            <Review>This heart-wrenching, activist documentary goes for the heart and the mind with its dramatic story of a crusading Marine Corps veteran fighting for victims of water pollution at Camp Lejeune.</Review>

            <Review>The only reason to see Dark Shadows is to discover how dire and pointless-how flat-out dreadful-a movie can be even when it has Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Helena Bonham Carter attached to its flimsy pretext.</Review>
            <Review>This is not so much a coherent movie as it is a long, expensive joke in search of a purpose.</Review>
            <Review>Mostly Dark Shadows is silly when we're trained to expect slightly richer fun from Burton and Depp.</Review>
            <Review>Fans of Depp's past collusions with Burton will find their rewards along the way. But there's a perfunctory vibe to the goings on, a weariness amid the weirdness.</Review>
            <Review>Clearly, they made the movie they wanted to make. It's just not the movie this "Dark Shadows" fan hoped to see.</Review>
            <Review>Dark Shadows' only meaningful relationship is between Depp and his audience. He's a persona now, no longer an actor.</Review>
            <Review>As much as it tries to make this a love story, we don't feel its heart pulsating. Barnabus is a vampire who wants his life back, but neither he nor the film truly succeeds.</Review>
            <Review>Not just a bad film; it's evidence of people who are barely even trying.</Review>
            <Review>Johnny Depp once again takes a role where he allows the make up and prosthetics to do the acting for him...</Review>
            <Review>The nadir of Burton's career and is likely going to be his biggest flop, a film that's not a comedy, not a drama, not a horror film, and not a fantasy.</Review>
            <Review>There's more than enough here for us older folks - and some younger ones, too - to have us exclaiming, Fangs for the memories.</Review>
            <Review>Burton really needed to lean his horror-comedy more toward horror. Instead, it's reminiscent at times of Love at First Bite and the feature film remakes of The Addams Family and The Brady Bunch.</Review>

            <Review>No one understands that giddy rush of sugar buzz cinema better than director Joe Dante.</Review>
            <Review>All the elements are here, they just don't add up to a satisfying whole.</Review>
            <Review>It's good to welcome back one of the undisputed masters of modern genre cinema -- and adventurous kids will love it.</Review>
            <Review>Cool it may be, but scary (or even mildly shudder-inducing) it ain't.</Review>
            <Review>Not likely to give anyone outside of toddler range any nightmares, but it's still a smooth, smart, and eminently likable "rainy night" family film.</Review>
            <Review>The Hole doesn't have the frantic wit of Dante's Gremlins 2 or the political import of his Small Soldiers, but it has something just as satisfying: a thorough understanding of the psychological underpinnings of the genre.</Review>
            <Review>On the surface, Dante's movies are juvenile horrors with some movie-savvy comedy thrown in, but underneath they're among the most subversive entertainments being made today. Hopefully future generations will discover this silly, smart gem.</Review>
            <Review>Sadly, the picture is just too mild for its own good.</Review>
            <Review>Dante once again finds similar success in The Hole, merging juvenile concerns with darker stories.</Review>
            <Review>Curb your expectations and know you're going into a film about how curious children overcome their fears, not how malevolent darkness torments a group of unsuspecting "victims."</Review>
            <Review>A refreshing example of how to make a film for a specific demographic the right way. ... Smart, scary and fun as hell.</Review>
            <Review>Entertaining, with a welcome sense of mischief, The Hole plays to Dante's strengths, returning him to a suburban battleground where young characters face off against an unstoppable, often knee-high malevolent force.</Review>

        <StoryLine>An abused 12-year-old runaway gets caught up in small-town politics when the corrupt mayor schemes to capitalize on her plight in a shady bid to get re-elected. Concerned for her abusive mother yet unwilling to be taken away by social workers, Clancy Miller (Christina Dawn Fougnie) chooses life on the streets over life in a foster home. But the streets can be dangerous -- especially for a little girl -- and after praying for a guardian angel to watch over her, Clancy encounters an ill-tempered homeless veteran named Nick (Jefferson Moore). When the disgraced mayor catches wind of the situation, he offers Nick a sizable payday if he can keep Clancy out of the public eye until the day before the elections. Hours before the voters file in to cast their ballots, the mayor will then "find" Clancy in grand fashion and win by a landslide. But the plan hits a hitch when Nick has a scuffle with a nasty loan shark, and he's forced to take Clancy out of the city to keep her safe. As the young girl and her reluctant protector work their way through the countryside, an unlikely friendship develops and Nick begins to see the world though a child's eyes. Meanwhile, the mayor announces a massive manhunt and military-style rescue mission for Clancy, and the locals gather around their televisions hoping for a happy outcome to the tense situation.</StoryLine>

Despite distance, long separations, and a dangerously hostile regime, their love endures until the very end. A story of devotion and human understanding set against a backdrop of political turmoil that continues today. The Lady was written over a period of three years by Rebecca Frayn. Interviews with key figures in Aung San Suu Kyi's entourage enabled her to reconstruct for the first time the true story of Burma's national heroine. -- (C) Cohen Media Group</StoryLine>

            <Review>The Lady is a slog, a two-and-a-half hour, painted-on-wood exercise in political iconography.</Review>
            <Review>"The Lady" is a two-hour trip into earnestness, from which audiences will want a little liberation of their own.</Review>
            <Review>The Lady is little more than a history lesson - although a beautifully presented one - wrapped in the pink gloss of a G-rated potboiler evidenced in Suu Kyi's and Michael's storybook romance.</Review>
            <Review>A heavy-handed attempt to sanctify one of the most dignified and uncompromising politicians and human rights champions of recent times.</Review>
            <Review>[It] does indeed deal with a real life, but follows so faithfully the traditional shape of film biography that it feels less convincing.</Review>
            <Review>This hagiography of Myanmar's Nobel Peace Prize-winner, Aung San Suu Kyi, is earnest, civilized and borderline unendurable.</Review>
            <Review>The film-makers are more deft in dramatising these little-known details that never made the headlines, and the tears of genuine sensitivity they elicit may wash away _ or cover up _ the shortcomings in bringing this real-life human struggle to the screen.</Review>
            <Review>The dramatic moments are few and far between, and the film seems like it walks in the footsteps of Richard Attenborough's Gandhi at times. Besson definitely tries to present Suu Kyi in a similarly reverent light.</Review>
            <Review>The villains are caricatures, the emotions melodramatic, the politics black-and-white - yet French director Luc Besson moves the saga briskly, and does not back away from the violence.</Review>
            <Review>Biopic of Ang San Suu Kyi a notch above the rest</Review>
            <Review>Great person, but not a great movie</Review>
            <Review>Besson hits familiar biopic beats, but the formula could have used something a little more daring to liven things up.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Veteran paranormal researchers Dr. Margaret Matheson (Sigourney Weaver) and Tom Buckley (Cillian Murphy) debunk fraudulent claims of ghost whispering, faith healing and other psychic phenomena by detecting what Matheson calls "red lights," the subtle tricks behind every staged supernatural occurrence. But when the legendary blind psychic Simon Silver (Robert De Niro)comes out of retirement after 30 years, his once-fearless adversary Matheson warns Buckley to back off, fearing reprisal from the powerful Silver. Determined to discredit Silver, Buckley and his star student (Elizabeth Olsen) use every tool at their disposal to uncover the truth behind the charismatic, spoon-bending, mind reader. But Buckley is forced to reexamine his own core beliefs as his quest builds to a mind-blowing conclusion in this taut psychological thriller from award-winning writer and director Rodrigo Cort�s. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>A clever thriller, bolstered by three great performances.</Review>
            <Review>The film doesn't offer the sense of release, or of surprise, that it seems to take for granted.</Review>
            <Review>"The X-Files" is long gone. Hail and farewell. But its spirit lives on in "Red Lights." Hail, hail.</Review>
            <Review>By strict definition, any movie featuring Robert De Niro as a spoon-bending clairvoyant superstar ought to hold a few cards up its sleeve.</Review>
            <Review>A lot of talent comes up empty in "Red Lights," a thriller that doesn't thrill.</Review>
            <Review>With the sort of last-minute plot twist that sank M. Night Shyamalan's career, Red Lights comes to an unexpected, risible end.</Review>
            <Review>It's crushingly disappointing when it falls apart so completely in the second half.</Review>
            <Review>It almost feels like an occult thriller that has slowly transformed into a comedy -- and you didn't even notice.</Review>
            <Review>Red Lights has a decent premise, but the script lets the actors down. While it has interesting twists and bucks convention, the story is just far too weak to be enjoyable.</Review>
            <Review>A fun caper thinly veiled as a supernatural thriller - a mystery loaded with all the tricks and devices recently made popular by M. Night Shyamalan.</Review>

        <Duration>121</Duration>
        <StoryLine>As one of the defining stories of the wuxia genre, the saga of the Dragon Gate Inn has already been the source material for two classic martial arts films. Now legendary writer/director/producer Tsui Hark revisits these legends in The Flying Swords of Dragon Gate bringing new characters and ancient conflicts to life through the vivid depth of 3D and the epic scale of the IMAX image. The film picks up three years after the disappearance of the enigmatic innkeeper Jade and the massive fire that consumed the Inn. A new Dragon Inn has risen from the ashes, staffed by a band of marauders. Masquerading as law-abiding citizens by day, they use the cover of night to continue their true calling as fortune hunters. For legend says that the Dragon Inn is the site of a lost city buried in the desert--and a treasure that spans dynasties hidden deep within. -- (C) Indomina</StoryLine>

            <Review>For followers of wuxia films, the epic Flying Swords of Dragon Gate is a godsend...But the convoluted storyline...blunts the appeal for anyone who's not a fan.</Review>
            <Review>The plot is secondary. "Flying Swords" is to be seen for its eye-popping action.</Review>
            <Review>"Flying Swords" is a chunky spectacle, to be sure - overstuffed with plot and characters - but at times, it's an insanely entertaining one.</Review>
            <Review>While the attractive performers and the action set pieces, including fights inside a sand tornado and around a spider's web of razor wire, are enough to carry you through the film, "Flying Swords" is a bit of a letdown ...</Review>
            <Review>IMAX 3D turns a slightly above-average "wuxia" ("martial hero" action thriller) into an epic extravaganza.</Review>
            <Review>Visually inventive yet dramatically lacking.</Review>
            <Review>It's fun in the moment, but hardly one for the ages.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is beautifully designed and the action sequences are violent and truly spectacular in a hallucinatory way.</Review>
            <Review>It's nonsense, but somehow irresistible.</Review>
            <Review>Despite the movie's excessive length and incomprehensible plot, Tsui is still one of the world's absolute best at action and fight sequences; they move fast, but they're dazzlingly fluid and smooth.</Review>
            <Review>Although there is some enjoyment to be found in Flying Swords of Dragon Gate, it's a wuxia film that is mostly very messy in every sense of the word.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Susan Hayward and Dean Martin throw a wrench into Wilfred Hyde-White's political machine in this Depression-era tale of corruption and power. Plucked out of obscurity by crooked party boss Sylvester Marin (Hyde-White), good ol' country boy Bo Gillis (Martin) is elected governor based solely on smear tactics. Married to Ada (Hayward), an ambitious call girl he met during the campaign, Bo soon discovers he's only a puppet with Marin pulling the stings. So when Ada convinces her husband to stand up and fight back, it leads to car bombings and blackmail as Marin battles the Gillis' for control of the state. Based on Wirt Williams' Pulitzer Prize-nominated novel, Ada was partially inspired by Jimmie Davis, the singing governor of Louisiana, whose campaign song "You Are My Sunshine" is echoed by "May the Lord Bless You Real Good," a tune written especially for the film and performed by Martin.</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>A darkly turbulent crime noir from Thai new wave director Pen-ek Ratanaruang, Headshot is an existential thriller, ripe with shadowy paranoia that will turn your world upside-down, literally. This disorienting game of cat and mouse is played out in present-day Thailand, where corruption runs rampant and the good die young. When Tul, a straight-laced cop, is blackmailed by a powerful politician he soon becomes disillusioned by the state of human nature and, in his vengeful condition, is recruited to become a hitman for an iconoclastic group aimed at eliminating those who are above the law. But when a devastating blow turns Tul's vision upside-down, he finds himself engulfed by doubt, unaware of whether the condition is medical or a result of karmic retribution. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>While there are some great twists and revelations here, I just kept wishing it would stop with all the cinematic tricks and get to more conventional, straight- forward storytelling.</Review>
            <Review>A dreamy, elliptical neo-noir about a cop turned killer turned something else altogether.</Review>
            <Review>Headshot is, unfortunately, far better with ideas than with narrative.</Review>
            <Review>Neither fresh nor especially satisfying, but Ratanaruang distinguishes the hunt with his fluid kineticism, especially in the just-a-touch-too-infrequent shoot-outs and beatdowns.</Review>
            <Review>Its vision of contemporary Thailand is recognizable as another society undeserving of redemption, but worthy of poetry.</Review>
            <Review>If the titular headshot leaves Tul with inverted vision, the film too turns the characteristics of genre upside-down, defamiliarising everything - an effect that is helped considerably by Ratanaruang's way with moody stylisation.</Review>
            <Review>The visual contrast between the ultraviolent showdowns and the quieter, more character-driven moments is striking.</Review>
            <Review>This Thai crime thriller has some novel ideas and is strikingly shot, but a jumbled, overreaching narrative robs it of cohesion.</Review>
            <Review>This "Buddhist film noir," as writer-director Pen-ek Ratanaruang calls it, is surprisingly slow-moving and soulful for a film full of double-crosses and cold-blooded killing.</Review>
            <Review>A crisp crime thriller with a perfectly calibrated atmosphere</Review>
            <Review>It's wholly unfair to judge a movie on what it could have been, but few films place their potential on a pedestal and fail to engage it like Headshot.</Review>
            <Review>The result is a film of high style and assured cool, even if the storytelling gets a little gummy late in the game.</Review>

        <StoryLine>A short-tempered, unemployed music critic who likes to dress as a polar bear thinks he can harness the power of the people to ride the monorail to political victory in Seattle. And he's right. Almost. It's before Twitter, before the flash mob, before Obama. It's 2001, and political unknown Grant Cogswell decides he must take down Seattle City Councilman Richard McIver. Grant has only one dream, but it's a big one: an elegant monorail gliding silently above the city's wet streets. Grassroots is a character-driven comedy about the power of the people and the virtues of standing up for what you believe in. Against all odds. -- (C) Samuel Goldwyn</StoryLine>

            <Review>An enjoyable, fitfully engaging but ever-so-slightly forgettable minor-key political comedy.</Review>
            <Review>Grassroots is a movie where bad ideas, because they're the ones championed by the "correct" side, are king. It never acknowledges that sometimes idealism is just another kind of manipulation.</Review>
            <Review>At first glance, "Grassroots" doesn't seem like much of an idea for a movie. Nor at second, third or fourth glance.</Review>
            <Review>Although it only glosses the mechanics of local politics, it exudes an endearingly scruffy charm.</Review>
            <Review>This is one film as misguided as the business-as-usual subject it aims to critique.</Review>
            <Review>Grassroots disingenuously has it both ways, reducing politics first to a David-versus-Goliath adventure, and then to an everyone-is-cool bowl of mush.</Review>
            <Review>A movie populated by dislikeable characters and written/directed with no aplomb whatsoever ...</Review>
            <Review>[A] refreshing real-life political story ...</Review>
            <Review>There's a terrific sense of righteous anger in this scruffy comedy about disenfranchised people shaking American politics to its core.</Review>

            <Review>You'll root for the giant all the way.</Review>

            <Review>There's a great movie to be made about the survivors of Woodstock Nation and their children. But in order to make that movie, you first have to respect the ideals of that generation enough to at least give them their due.</Review>

            <Review>The once divisive 'Hanoi Jane' is now a harmless hippie dispensing homegrown marijuana and homilies about love and 'transformation' in this cornball, clichéd and predictable yet agreeable and entertaining movie.</Review>
            <Review>The lighting was so off in this movie that bright patches of sunlight made me squint and dark nighttime scenes lost some character's facial features.</Review>
            <Review>For a movie that professes to teach us to get past our insecurities and think more freely, it does so with astonishingly conventional storytelling tropes.</Review>

        <Duration>82</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Filmmaker Stephanie Johnes documents how what was once a simple exercise fad has taken on exciting and unforeseen dimensions in this look at the hyper-competitive world of jumping rope. Thirty-years ago kids were skipping rope on the sidewalk, and health-conscious adults were bringing the practice into the gym. It wasn't long before the simple act of jumping rope evolved into something more ambitious though, and as acrobatics and fancy footwork came into play a certain playful competition began to take form. Eventually, an international rope jumping competition was established. With this documentary, Johnes tells the stories of two teams - one inner-city African-American and the other suburban Caucasian - who each long to take home the title that proves just how fast they can keep their feet moving.</StoryLine>

        <ReleaseDate> 2012</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>108</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Ka Shen Kwan was born in Hong Kong in 1939, the daughter of a Chinese architect and a Scottish model. Ka Shen was a gifted dancer and vocalist, and was studying at London's prestigious Royal Ballet School when she was spotted by noted movie producer Ray Stark. Stark was looking for a fresh new talent to star in a film adaptation of Richard Mason's novel The World Of Suzie Wong, and he was had a hunch eighteen-year-old Ka Shen was the sort of woman he was looking for. After several screen tests, Ka Shen won the role of Suzie Wong, and took the stage name Nancy Kwan. The World Of Suzie Wong earned Kwan an Academy Award nomination and made her an overnight star; at a time when most Asian actors were stuck playing demeaning, stereotyped roles (and many roles for Asians were played by Caucasian actors in make-up), Kwan became one of Hollywood's first Asian stars and a big-screen sex symbol. Kwan's next picture was a box-office smash, a screen version of the hit Broadway musical Flower Drum Song, and Kwan worked steadily in major studio productions through the 1960s. In 1972, Kwan moved back to Hong Kong to look after her ailing father and ended up staying ten years, continuing to act while also launching a new career as a producer. Filmmaker Brian Jamieson offers an intimate look as Nancy Kwan's private and professional lives in the documentary To Whom It May Concern: Ka Shen's Journey, which features extensive interviews with Kwan as well as Sandra Allen, Joan Chen, France Nuyen and Vivian Wu. The film received its world premiere at the 2010 Cinequest Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>Fifteen-year-old Camille (Lola Cr�ton) is a serious, intensely focused girl who has fallen in love with cheerful Sullivan (Sebastian Urzendowsky), an older boy who reciprocates her feelings, mostly, but wants to be free to explore the world. When he leaves her to travel through South America, she is devastated. But over the next eight years, she develops into a more fully formed woman, with new interests and a new love-and the possibility that she'll be less defenseless when Sullivan enters her life again. Filled with scenes that showcase her extraordinary ability to evoke moods and feelings, Hansen-L�ve takes the story of a girl's first romance and makes it into a singular experience, familiar in its broad strokes and yet so specific that it feels uniquely personal. -- (C) IFC</StoryLine>

In the 1980s an intrepid Australian pilot left behind a surfboard in the seaside village of Vanimo. Twenty years on, surfing is not only a pillar of village life but also a means to prestige. With no access to economic or educational advancement, let alone running water and power, village life is hermetic. A spot on the Papua New Guinea national surfing team is the way to see the wider world; the only way. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>For the most part, it's a film filled with simple pleasures...</Review>
            <Review>Damsels in Distress ambles about amiably without much of a narrative: Plot has never been Stillman's strong suit, and in this film he seems particularly indifferent to its demands.</Review>
            <Review>There's a self-consciousness to "Damsels" that takes away much of the fun.</Review>
            <Review>While the comedy might be patchy, Gerwig and Stillman make for quite the two-step.</Review>
            <Review>[I]ts daffy, otherworldly story, rehearsing but not rehashing Stillman's frankly reactionary instincts, resounds less for its charming gaggle of collegiate women than for its dramatization of self-deception and the despair of depression.</Review>
            <Review>Although the themes of clueless rich kids acting boorishly are very much the same as in Stillman's biggest hits, 'Metropolitan' and 'Barcelona,' the light and breezy "Damsels" more than stands on its own as an Austen-tatious delight.</Review>
            <Review>Why he would once again focus his imagination on another ensemble of shallow, self-absorbed characters that are all directed to speak like they were born in the same upper-class Connecticut suburb indicates a one-track mind, at the least.</Review>
            <Review>One doesn't realize one has missed the airless irony of Whit Stillman until one sees Stillman's first feature film in 13 years.</Review>
            <Review>Greta Gerwig gives a career-defining performance.</Review>
            <Review>And while it occasionally feels a little wobbly, it grows more sure of itself and richer as it goes along.</Review>

        <Duration>86</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Humanity's ascent is often measured by the speed of progress. But what if progress is actually spiraling us downwards, towards collapse? Ronald Wright, whose best-seller, A Short History Of Progress inspired Surviving Progress, shows how past civilizations were destroyed by "progress traps" - alluring technologies and belief systems that serve immediate needs, but ransom the future. As pressure on the world's resources accelerates and financial elites bankrupt nations, can our globally-entwined civilization escape a final, catastrophic progress trap? With potent images and illuminating insights from thinkers who have probed our genes, our brains, and our social behaviour, this requiem to progress-as-usual also poses a challenge: to prove that making apes smarter isn't an evolutionary dead-end. -- (C) First Run</StoryLine>

            <Review>These are critically important issues, but it needs a sharper point to get through thick skulls, and even evolved humans who are tired of the treadmill of progress might ask: What else is new?</Review>
            <Review>A slick jeremiad, "Surviving Progress" is expertly made (it's far from tedious) but intellectually muddled.</Review>
            <Review>[A] remarkably cogent, albeit remarkably alarming, film.</Review>
            <Review>They shy away from proposing solutions, and the filmmakers capture humanizing clashes that illustrate the challenges of finding a balance that serves all parties.</Review>
            <Review>Mathieu Roy and Harold Crooks, adapting a book by Ronald Wright, argue so persuasively that the human race is spinning out of control.</Review>
            <Review>It's self-evident and tells the truth.</Review>
            <Review>Persuasively argued in places, the film never really gets beyond the surface. That, however, may also be the point.</Review>
            <Review>But this is not a film interested in partisan finger-wagging, nor is it looking to place blame directly on one specific group or another (despite some pretty heavy glances toward [some] politicians). No. "Surviving Progress" is more philosophical.</Review>
            <Review>Instead of providing anything in the way of new ideas or even in-depth treatment of old ideas, Surviving Progress is content to be the world's longest book trailer.</Review>
            <Review>One of those annoying runaway films in which every on-camera point is an excuse to cut to gratuitous, expensive images.</Review>
            <Review>Debates will be inevitable after viewing this with a friend. But after about halfway through, the movie repeats itself. I was getting bored when scientist after scientist was saying the same thing over and over again</Review>
            <Review>Unlike many current documentaries, it offers a fresh take on familiar issues.</Review>

        <StoryLine>The ubiquitous pink ribbons of breast cancer philanthropy and the hand-in-hand marketing of brands and products associated with it permeates our culture, providing assurance that we are engaged in a successful battle against this insidious disease. But the campaign obscures the reality and facts of breast cancer, more and more women are diagnosed with breast cancer every year, and face the same treatment options they did 40 years ago. Yet women are also the most influential market group, buying 80 percent of consumer products and making most major household purchasing decisions. So then who really benefits from the pink ribbon campaigns - the cause or the company? -- (C) First Run</StoryLine>

            <Review>In the 98 minutes of "Pink Ribbons, Inc.," a wealth of information and images flit past, many intended to raise eyebrows if not ire.</Review>
            <Review>You have to agree with the advocates who charge that some corporations are milking cancer.</Review>
            <Review>"Pink Ribbons, Inc." is a colorful indictment of corporate infestation, but it's missing a prescription.</Review>
            <Review>At the very least ... this documentary will make you question the status quo.</Review>
            <Review>The film raises the question of whether branding the disease has taken precedence over preventing it.</Review>
            <Review>It's a well-argued polemic that, despite being one-sided, has loads of useful information to share, if only to begin a crucial argument about health care, allocation and coordination of research dollars, consumerism and the privatization of philanthropy.</Review>
            <Review>Every concerned moviegoer should give this movie's case a fair hearing.</Review>
            <Review>...Ribbons is borderline milquetoast: it doesn't have the courage of its convictions.</Review>
            <Review>Pink Ribbons, Inc. amasses a wide array of pink-tinted footage, balanced by the testimony of women with Stage 4 cancer and experts who haven't drunk the Kool-Aid, pink or otherwise</Review>
            <Review>One of the hallmarks of a great documentary is telling you something you never expected to hear...This Canadian film will, if nothing else, make you think twice every time you see a pink ribbon.</Review>
            <Review>Pink Ribbons is an intelligent and moving account of how capitalism has profited off philanthropy, and how it's hurt cancer patients in the process.</Review>
            <Review>It rakes the muck quite effectively.</Review>

        <Duration>108</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Audrey Tautou is Nathalie, a beautiful, happy, and successful Parisian business executive who finds herself suddenly widowed after a three-year marriage to her soul mate. To cope with her loss, she buries herself and her emotions in her work to the dismay of her friends, family and co-workers. One day, inexplicably, her zest for life and love is rekindled by a most unlikely source, her seemingly unexceptional, gauche, and average looking office subordinate, Markus (comic star Francois Damiens). At first stunned by Nathalie's unexpected attention, Markus comes to gradually believe in her feelings and shifts into romantic high gear. As their relationship goes from awkward to genuinely loving, Nathalie and Markus will have to overcome a host of obstacles including everyone else's judgmental perceptions as well as their own self-doubts. -- (C) CMG</StoryLine>

            <Review>Although there's some meat on the menu, "Delicacy" ends up as lightly sugared and as gently bent as a fortune cookie.</Review>
            <Review>It never hits the target, but its sincerity is surely preferable to the machine-tooled slickness of Hollywood models.</Review>
            <Review>"Delicacy" isn't going to set anybody's psyche on fire with its insights into grieving and emotional recovery, but as a crepe-thin romantic snack, it has its moments.</Review>
            <Review>Their princess-frog courtship has some funny moments, but the trauma and ongoing adjustment of someone losing a spouse is downplayed too much for the story to be entirely convincing.</Review>
            <Review>A charming French love story about a beautiful widow and the schlub who loves her.</Review>
            <Review>From its very title, it's clear that "Delicacy" aims to be a sweet, light French trifle. That it is.</Review>
            <Review>Foenkinos brothers' balance of light comedy and moody desperation is conveyed with a breezy cinematic style</Review>
            <Review>Audrey Tautou stars in a light but charming French tale of 'Beauty and the Bumbling'.</Review>
            <Review>A satisfying, feather-light serving of romantic whimsy.</Review>
            <Review>Delicacy is sweet, but never sickly in its sweetness. Tender, but not to the point of mush. Great performances sell its unlikely love story, while innovative direction frames it into an entertaining and digestible package.</Review>
            <Review>With loss of tension comes loss of involvement and the gradual, delicate progress of Nathalie's inner life that is probably so well captured in prose, turns to an impediment for the screen</Review>
            <Review>The slow swell to a final resounding crescendo of light and happiness takes its time but is worth the wait as Nathalie finds what she is looking for</Review>

            <Review>"Drunkboat" might have come off via nothing more than acting ability and a good heart, if the dialogue didn't amount mostly to aimless chit-chat.</Review>
            <Review>The burnished smear of Lisa Rinzler's photography is a plus, but "Drunkboat" is ultimately the kind of pet project that never traverses from personal to powerful.</Review>
            <Review>Though studied and grating at times, "Drunkboat" does sustain a distinct, odd tone. Like its characters it's dreamily restless and prey to its own quixotic ideas.</Review>
            <Review>This enigmatic coming-of-age movie often seems destined to sail off the deep end. Yet it rights itself just often enough to keep you watching.</Review>
            <Review>[An] incoherent drama.</Review>
            <Review>A passion project ill suited to cinematic adaptation, or at least sludgy, unresolved, mannered and grating in its realized incarnation.</Review>
            <Review>... feels like an intimate, idiosyncratic acting workshop that might have worked better on stage.</Review>
            <Review>Undercooked, lazy and frustratingly underwhelming despite solid performances.</Review>
            <Review>Drunkboat is a "small" movie that plays like a mawkish, Friedberg/Seltzer riff on a small movie.</Review>
            <Review>Horribly written, shockingly amateur. Contrived and exhausting don't begin to summarize this inert disaster.</Review>
            <Review>In the end, "Drunkboat" is no "Glengarry Glen Ross" or "American Buffalo," and even if it were, the real Mamet has always worked better onstage than on film.</Review>
            <Review>Held up from release for years, probably because nobody knew what to make of it, the film deserves a look, and Meyer is a talent worth watching.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 1945</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>115</Duration>
        <StoryLine>In this 1945 filmization of Emlyn Williams' semi-autobiographical 1938 play +The Corn is Green, Bette Davis steps into the role originated on Broadway by Ethel Barrymore. Davis plays Miss Moffat, a turn-of-the-century schoolteacher in a Welsh mining town. She has opened her own school in hopes of lowering the town's illiteracy rate, thus enabling the younger residents to seek out more fulfilling lives than merely sweating away in the mines until they drop. She runs into a great deal of resistance from mine-owner Nigel Bruce, who realizes that as soon as the citizens can read and write, they'll rebel against his benevolent despotry. Even Miss Moffat concludes that her mission is hopeless until she is visited by young miner John Dall, who wants to know "what is behind all those books". Within two years, Dall has made so much progress that he has qualified for Oxford. A last-minute snag involving Dall's illegitimate child is solved when Miss Moffet herself agrees to adopt the baby so that her student can complete his education. Emlyn Williams himself came from a backward mining town, and was himself inspired to better things by a compassionate schoolteacher; the pregnancy angle was (probably) added to provide the story with a third act. The Corn is Green was remade for television in 1978, with Katharine Hepburn as Miss Moffat. Watch for one amusing gaffe in the original: despite carefully setting up the premise that the villagers are illiterate, they are shown hovering around a poster and reading it out loud in an early scene.</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>This direct-to-video Christian drama concerns Pastor Luke, a minister blessed with rare gifts that enable him to inspire others. Sadly, though, his small-town congregation isn't large enough to fully benefit from this. Guided by the conviction that he's doing God's will, Luke moves to a densely-populated urban area and achieves fame as a televangelist, but a series of personal crises arise, help shape his character and turn him into the man the Lord truly wants him to be. The supporting cast includes Jeremy Brennan and Victoria Abbott. ~ Nathan Southern, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>The Letter is not a thriller. It is barely a film. It's a boring, self-important, disjointed and pointless pile of tripe masquerading as a movie.</Review>

            <Review>If you're a Batman fan, just hearing the words The Dark Knight Returns likely gets you excited, so this film was probably already on your radar...</Review>
            <Review>DC's theatrical releases may be facing a bleak future, but titles like this remind us that their direct-to-video line is alive and well.</Review>
            <Review>It's highly respectful of the work on which it is based, yet also a solidly entertaining effort in its own right.</Review>
