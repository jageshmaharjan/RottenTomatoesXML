        <Duration>108</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Audrey Tautou is Nathalie, a beautiful, happy, and successful Parisian business executive who finds herself suddenly widowed after a three-year marriage to her soul mate. To cope with her loss, she buries herself and her emotions in her work to the dismay of her friends, family and co-workers. One day, inexplicably, her zest for life and love is rekindled by a most unlikely source, her seemingly unexceptional, gauche, and average looking office subordinate, Markus (comic star Francois Damiens). At first stunned by Nathalie's unexpected attention, Markus comes to gradually believe in her feelings and shifts into romantic high gear. As their relationship goes from awkward to genuinely loving, Nathalie and Markus will have to overcome a host of obstacles including everyone else's judgmental perceptions as well as their own self-doubts. -- (C) CMG</StoryLine>

            <Review>Although there's some meat on the menu, "Delicacy" ends up as lightly sugared and as gently bent as a fortune cookie.</Review>
            <Review>It never hits the target, but its sincerity is surely preferable to the machine-tooled slickness of Hollywood models.</Review>
            <Review>"Delicacy" isn't going to set anybody's psyche on fire with its insights into grieving and emotional recovery, but as a crepe-thin romantic snack, it has its moments.</Review>
            <Review>Their princess-frog courtship has some funny moments, but the trauma and ongoing adjustment of someone losing a spouse is downplayed too much for the story to be entirely convincing.</Review>
            <Review>A charming French love story about a beautiful widow and the schlub who loves her.</Review>
            <Review>From its very title, it's clear that "Delicacy" aims to be a sweet, light French trifle. That it is.</Review>

            <Review>Audrey Tautou stars in a light but charming French tale of 'Beauty and the Bumbling'.</Review>
            <Review>A satisfying, feather-light serving of romantic whimsy.</Review>
            <Review>Delicacy is sweet, but never sickly in its sweetness. Tender, but not to the point of mush. Great performances sell its unlikely love story, while innovative direction frames it into an entertaining and digestible package.</Review>
            <Review>With loss of tension comes loss of involvement and the gradual, delicate progress of Nathalie's inner life that is probably so well captured in prose, turns to an impediment for the screen</Review>
            <Review>The slow swell to a final resounding crescendo of light and happiness takes its time but is worth the wait as Nathalie finds what she is looking for</Review>

            <Review>For the cast, shooting the movie (in Ukraine) may have been a working vacation, but for viewers, watching it is an excruciating sentence of hard labor.</Review>
            <Review>A talented cast is wasted in this sub-par, umpteenth variation on The Dirty Dozen.</Review>
            <Review>Soldiers of Fortune has a good cast, and most of them try their best, but you have to wonder why any of them actually signed on for this lopsided movie.</Review>
            <Review>Soldiers of Fortune is...hardly the fun throwback to the action films of the 1980s that one might've hoped for...</Review>
            <Review>While the conclusion doesn't inspire much enthusiasm, Soldiers of Fortune carries a lot further than most of its ilk, providing a small dose of entertainment in a genre that typically elicits eye-rolls and yawns.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Filmmaker Stephanie Johnes documents how what was once a simple exercise fad has taken on exciting and unforeseen dimensions in this look at the hyper-competitive world of jumping rope. Thirty-years ago kids were skipping rope on the sidewalk, and health-conscious adults were bringing the practice into the gym. It wasn't long before the simple act of jumping rope evolved into something more ambitious though, and as acrobatics and fancy footwork came into play a certain playful competition began to take form. Eventually, an international rope jumping competition was established. With this documentary, Johnes tells the stories of two teams - one inner-city African-American and the other suburban Caucasian - who each long to take home the title that proves just how fast they can keep their feet moving.</StoryLine>

The story resonates with the struggle of Uncle Mort, making the story much deeper than a simple tale of a boy and his boat.

            <Review>"Drunkboat" might have come off via nothing more than acting ability and a good heart, if the dialogue didn't amount mostly to aimless chit-chat.</Review>
            <Review>The burnished smear of Lisa Rinzler's photography is a plus, but "Drunkboat" is ultimately the kind of pet project that never traverses from personal to powerful.</Review>
            <Review>Though studied and grating at times, "Drunkboat" does sustain a distinct, odd tone. Like its characters it's dreamily restless and prey to its own quixotic ideas.</Review>
            <Review>This enigmatic coming-of-age movie often seems destined to sail off the deep end. Yet it rights itself just often enough to keep you watching.</Review>
            <Review>[An] incoherent drama.</Review>
            <Review>A passion project ill suited to cinematic adaptation, or at least sludgy, unresolved, mannered and grating in its realized incarnation.</Review>
            <Review>... feels like an intimate, idiosyncratic acting workshop that might have worked better on stage.</Review>
            <Review>Undercooked, lazy and frustratingly underwhelming despite solid performances.</Review>
            <Review>Drunkboat is a "small" movie that plays like a mawkish, Friedberg/Seltzer riff on a small movie.</Review>
            <Review>Horribly written, shockingly amateur. Contrived and exhausting don't begin to summarize this inert disaster.</Review>
            <Review>In the end, "Drunkboat" is no "Glengarry Glen Ross" or "American Buffalo," and even if it were, the real Mamet has always worked better onstage than on film.</Review>
            <Review>Held up from release for years, probably because nobody knew what to make of it, the film deserves a look, and Meyer is a talent worth watching.</Review>

            <Review>Infusing plenty of laconic wit into his role, Robert Downey Jr is impressive as ever.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2012</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>108</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Ka Shen Kwan was born in Hong Kong in 1939, the daughter of a Chinese architect and a Scottish model. Ka Shen was a gifted dancer and vocalist, and was studying at London's prestigious Royal Ballet School when she was spotted by noted movie producer Ray Stark. Stark was looking for a fresh new talent to star in a film adaptation of Richard Mason's novel The World Of Suzie Wong, and he was had a hunch eighteen-year-old Ka Shen was the sort of woman he was looking for. After several screen tests, Ka Shen won the role of Suzie Wong, and took the stage name Nancy Kwan. The World Of Suzie Wong earned Kwan an Academy Award nomination and made her an overnight star; at a time when most Asian actors were stuck playing demeaning, stereotyped roles (and many roles for Asians were played by Caucasian actors in make-up), Kwan became one of Hollywood's first Asian stars and a big-screen sex symbol. Kwan's next picture was a box-office smash, a screen version of the hit Broadway musical Flower Drum Song, and Kwan worked steadily in major studio productions through the 1960s. In 1972, Kwan moved back to Hong Kong to look after her ailing father and ended up staying ten years, continuing to act while also launching a new career as a producer. Filmmaker Brian Jamieson offers an intimate look as Nancy Kwan's private and professional lives in the documentary To Whom It May Concern: Ka Shen's Journey, which features extensive interviews with Kwan as well as Sandra Allen, Joan Chen, France Nuyen and Vivian Wu. The film received its world premiere at the 2010 Cinequest Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <Title>The Magnificent Ambersons</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 1942</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>88</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Orson Welles' followup to Citizen Kane (1941) was utterly different from Kane in style and texture, but just as brilliant in its own way. Writer/director Welles does not appear on camera, but his voiceover narration superbly sets the stage for the movie's action, which fades in valentine fashion on Amberson Mansion, the most ostentatious dwelling in all of turn-of-century Indianapolis. Its mistress is the haughtily beautiful Isabel Amberson (Dolores Costello). When Isabel's beau, erstwhile inventor Eugene Morgan (Joseph Cotten), inadvertently humiliates her in public, she breaks off the relationship and marries colorless Wilbur Minafer (Donald Dillaway). The neighbors are certain that, since Isabel can't possibly love Wilbur, she will spoil her children rotten. As it turns out, she has one child, George Minafer (Tim Holt), and that one is enough as far as the rest of Indianapolis is concerned. There are those who live for the day that the arrogant, insufferable George will get his comeuppance. When George returns home from college, his mother and grandfather (Richard Bennett) hold a gala reception in his honor. Among the guests is the older-and-wiser Eugene, now a prosperous automobile manufacturer, and his pretty daughter Lucy (Anne Baxter). George takes to Lucy immediately, but can't warm up to Eugene, especially after learning from his uncle Jack Amberson (Ray Collins) and his maiden aunt Fanny (Agnes Moorehead) that Eugene and Isabel had once been sweethearts. After the death of Wilbur Minafer, the widowed Eugene feels emboldened enough to propose to Isabel again. This time she is willing, but the obstreperous George refuses to allow his mother to see Eugene. His imperious bullheadedness will lead to tragedy for all concerned--and, at long last, a chastened George Minafer will indeed receive his comeuppance. The film's real villain is not George but that old intangible bugaboo called "Progress." As the automobile age comes to fruition, the elegant, cloistered lifestyle of the Ambersons fades from view, finally disappearing altogether. This is superbly foreshadowed in the "winter outing" sequence (filmed in an L.A. icehouse) in which George's two-horse sleigh is abandoned in favor of Eugene's clunky horseless carriage. Welles evokes performances that his actors seldom (if ever) matched in later years; even the very limited Tim Holt is wholly believable-and even a bit pitiable-as the blinkered George Amberson Minafer. The current version, however, is but a pale shadow of Welles' original concept. Out of time and overbudget, the movie previewed badly and was eventually sliced down to an abrupt 88 minutes (by, among others, editor Robert Wise, who would go on to direct such films as West Side Story and The Sound of Music). Even though the film therefore must be regarded as a marred masterpiece, the remaining two-thirds of Welles' original concept is still a thrilling cinematic experience, especially whenever Agnes Moorehead is on the screen. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>Even in this truncated form it's amazing and memorable.</Review>
            <Review>Ambersons is not another Citizen Kane, but it is good enough to remove Director Welles for keeps from the novice or one-picture-prodigy class.</Review>
            <Review>Although reams have been written about the mutilation of Orson Welles' second feature, what remains of it is nevertheless a major accomplishment.</Review>
            <Review>While telling this story, haltingly and clumsily, the movie runs from burdensome through heavy and dull to bad. It stutters and stumbles as Welles submerges Tarkington's story in a mess of radio and stage technique.</Review>
            <Review>Orson Welles devotes 9,000 feet of film to a spoiled brat who grows up as a spoiled, spiteful young man. This film hasn't a single moment of contrast; it piles on and on a tale of woe, but without once striking at least a true chord of sentimentality.</Review>
            <Review>The emotional sense of America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries is so palpable you can taste it.</Review>
            <Review>The bold cinematic techniques Welles employed in Citizen Kane are put to even more sophisticated use here.</Review>
            <Review>The performances, the cinematography, the melancholy tone of loss make [The Magnificent Ambersons] one of the most technically inspired films of Hollywood's past.</Review>
            <Review>Visually creative classic.</Review>
            <Review>The editors might have molested it, but The Magnificent Ambersons remains on a par with Orson Welles's greatest achievements.</Review>
            <Review>What remains is inevitably, irritatingly uneven, but still tender and insightful. It will cut you up.</Review>
            <Review>The essence of the Ambersons and of Ambersons is mortality.</Review>

            <Review>Director Tanya Wexler plays things broadly at times, but "Hysteria" has good fun with history while coming off far more wholesome than salacious.</Review>
            <Review>Its 95 minutes move along nicely, and Everett - languid as a cat in a sunbeam - makes his too-brief scenes into master classes of comedy.</Review>
            <Review>As a sex-education comedy, "Hysteria" is flaccid, forced and unfunny.</Review>
            <Review>The problem with "Hysteria" is that it keeps patting itself and us on the back for knowing better.</Review>
            <Review>Hysteria never gets too preachy or ponderous, and there's something in the film to educate even the most learned viewer.</Review>
            <Review>The movie also makes all the right noises about female sexual liberation. But its good intentions are undermined by sniggering jokes...</Review>
            <Review>It's the writing that sinks Hysteria, and there's no machine that can alleviate that.</Review>
            <Review>A lame love triangle, suffragist speechifying and a wee bit of coy tittering regarding ladies' private parts.</Review>
            <Review>When you think of vibrators, 'charming' probably isn't the first word that comes to mind.</Review>
            <Review>Given the allure of learning the origins of something as buzzworthy as the vibrator, Hysteria provides just enough pleasures to give it a pass.</Review>
            <Review>Don't be fooled by the period costumes and British accents, Hysteria is as obvious and pandering as comedies get.</Review>
            <Review>The film's light-hearted fictionalising of real events combines a mild feminist history lesson with mildly saucy fun.</Review>

            <Review>As for the Marigold Hotel, well, it's not the Delano. But overall it's a fine spot to spend a couple of hours.</Review>
            <Review>Basically, there's just too much crammed into "Marigold Hotel" for any of it to have impact. It may work as comfort food for old folks, but a bit less may have yielded a great deal more.</Review>
            <Review>The movie itself is a mawkish comedy-drama-romance, but the astounding cast makes it feel like a night on the West End.</Review>
            <Review>"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel" is an Indian dish for day-trippers. Lacking beef or sufficient spice, it's nonetheless colorful comfort food.</Review>
            <Review>The old pros elevate Hotel's otherwise pat screenplay into that sweet spot where predictability fails to negate pleasure.</Review>
            <Review>There's little that's surprising about the film - everyone ends up pretty much where you'd guess - but that predictable quality becomes part of the pleasure of watching it, like a book that's happily reread.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is visually sumptuous, the colors vibrant, the indigenous faces arresting, the local customs intriguing, and the soundtrack catchy.</Review>
            <Review>It's a movie about finding purpose in life, late in life, that makes its point by first subjecting its characters to the most reductive grumpy-old-men/women shenanigans.</Review>
            <Review>A predictable, sugary-sweet confection that thrives on the liver-spotted backs of its sterling silver-haired actors.</Review>
            <Review>its difficult to sit through the final scenes without thinking of what Madden could have cut to earn Marigold Hotel a five-star rating.</Review>
            <Review>Proof that even the young can mistakenly see the aged as elderly. Their bodies may have degraded, but their minds and spirits are no less sharp.</Review>
            <Review>The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a true example of an ensemble piece where a group of veteran actors show that they are just as good as they ever were.</Review>

            <Review>So much of this oddly named but perfectly played dramedy feels real, from the revisits to VHS tapes in parents' basements to the way a family member's glance can trigger fight-or-flight responses.</Review>
            <Review>Although it assumes a light, inoffensive tone, Do Deca is unquestionably the brothers' most personal film by virtue of its antiheroes, a pair of warring siblings seemingly inspired by the directors themselves.</Review>
            <Review>The performances, especially by Zissis and Lafleur, are effectively low-key, making their characters' occasional emotional outburst all the more compelling.</Review>
            <Review>There's a joke here, obviously, in the spectacle of two out-of-shape adults making fools of themselves at sporting events. Unfortunately it's the only joke, and it eventually wears thin.</Review>
            <Review>A decent idea for an episode of "Everybody Loves Raymond," "The Do-Deca-Pentathlon" falls short as a movie.</Review>
            <Review>"Do-Deca" can't always overcome the sensation that this is as much a no-budget as it is a no-holds-barred affair. But the sardonic slights and crafty insights are steadily there.</Review>
            <Review>But if Cyrus succeeded as a marriage of established (that is to say, bankable) Hollywood performers and the already codified mumblecore aesthetic, The Do-Deca-Pentathlon comes off as pointless retread.</Review>
            <Review>The Do-Deca-Pentathlon doesn't quite possess enough plot or substance to wholeheartedly warrant the full-length-feature treatment.</Review>
            <Review>You've seen overgrown man child characters in plenty of Will Ferrell movies, but The Do-Deca Pentathlon is funny without playing for laughs.</Review>
            <Review>The picture is strangely anticlimactic, despite highlighting numerous sporting events and a toxic domestic atmosphere, content to leisurely resolve discontent that feels like it deserves a more forceful approach.</Review>
            <Review>The story girding Do-Deca - though intriguing - doesn't feel as well-developed as previous Duplass scripts. As a result, it never quite resonates, style be darned.</Review>
            <Review>The wisest choice of all is to cast talented unknown actors, who make these characters and the absurd goings-on feel that much more real--and hence all the more funny.</Review>

        <Title>Adventures In Plymptoons!</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2012</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>85</Duration>
        <StoryLine>When it comes to independent animators, Bill Plympton is the undisputed king. His illustrations have been featured in The New York Times, The Village Voice, Vogue, Rolling Stone, Vanity Fair, Penthouse, and National Lampoon. Since 1981, when his political cartoon Plymptoons was syndicated nationally, he has become a major force and inspiration in the animation world. His work is recognized instantly: he's the guy behind the animated morphing heads, which became famous on MTV, as well as the opening credit sequence for "The Simpsons" episode Beware My Cheating Bart. Moving into motion pictures, Plympton earned two Academy Award nominations, has directed and animated over sixty animation shorts, live-action features, music videos, commercials and documentaries, including: ONE OF THOSE DAYS, HOW TO KISS, 25 WAYS TO QUIT SMOKING, PLYMPTOONS, THE TUNE and MUTANT ALIENS He's the only artist to have animated six feature length films- all by himself. ADVENTURES IN PLYMPTOONS! goes deep inside the method and madness of America's most independent animator, creatively incubated in his hometown of Portland, Oregon. Interviews with many of Plympton's collaborators, such as Tom Kenny (voice of SpongeBob SquarePants), David Silverman (Director THE SIMPSONS MOVIE), Terry Gilliam (Director, MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL), Martha Plimpton ('RAISING HOPE'), Matthew Modine (FULL METAL JACKET), Ed Begley, Jr., Peter Jason, Moby and "Weird Al" Yankovic, offer candid and comic insights into the irreverent man who has become an international success by not selling out.</StoryLine>

            <Review>"The Babymakers" is amazing in its complete lack of comedy, nearly satirical in its rejection of levity and full-on embrace of mediocrity.</Review>

            <Review>If this were real life and not a movie, Mr. Wildhorn would be written off as a crank and ostracized within a week.</Review>
            <Review>It's earnest, predictable and disposable.</Review>
            <Review>You can quarrel with the smiley-face outcome of every ordeal, but the tenderness and optimism are so powerful and ingratiating that only a viewer with the darkest sensibility will go away untouched.</Review>
            <Review>Shamelessly schmaltzy and predictable from first moment to last, Rob Reiner's The Magic of Belle Isle nonetheless manages to conjure a certain spell.</Review>
            <Review>Madsen, a strong actress who might have matched Freeman, is portrayed in varying shades of blandness. Even Freeman, good as his is, is held back here.</Review>
            <Review>All we're left with is an uneven story that could have landed on "Best of Straight-to-DVD" shelves or the $1 bin at your local Walmart for Grandma to find.</Review>

        <StoryLine>In his stand-up routine, Jerry Seinfeld points out that according to most studies, people's number one fear is public speaking and their number two fear is death, which means the average person who goes to a funeral would rather be in the casket than give the eulogy. For nearly two years, filmmakers Paul Galichia and Brian Weidling conducted interviews with hundreds of individuals to explore the physical symptoms and the emotional paralysis that public speaking can cause. On one extreme, speaking in public and social awkwardness hinders some from living productive lives. When presented with having to speak in public, even public figures experience painful and incoherent rambling. Then there is the cr�me of the crop - the people who have triumphed over their fear and now have an even bigger mission - to tell their stories. -- (C) Official Sites</StoryLine>

            <Review>Dreadfully paced, with the shoddy acting of everyone but Biehn magnified to punishing degrees in talky, lengthy, predictable scenes.</Review>
            <Review>Labeling a film grind house doesn't excuse soap-opera emoting and laughable dialogue.</Review>
            <Review>This is the kind of junky, hard-to-watch thriller that apologists claim is part of a long line of tough, grindhouse-style thrillers, but which is actually just amateurish gristle.</Review>
            <Review>It is dreary to envisage the viewer who could become emotionally involved in The Victim ...</Review>
            <Review>Extra helpings of off-kilter and off-key melodrama sink Michael Biehn's bewildering directorial debut, the nasty little down-and-dirty thriller The Victim.</Review>
            <Review>While it pains me to say unkind things about an actor I admire, I don't think Michael Biehn is destined to be a director.</Review>
            <Review>The Victim is a film that will most likely be ignored by those who can't handle the explicit yet chilling prologue, but those who can survive it are in for an unexpectedly amusing sleazefest.</Review>
            <Review>The Victim is a labor of love, and despite the thin narrative and low-budget shortcomings, the film makes for an interesting midnight movie. It's a bit light on humor, sans the film's amusing finale, but there's just enough here to keep genre fans smiling.</Review>
            <Review>Considering how little he had to work with and how harried the production schedule was, that the film plays as well as it does is truly impressive, despite occasional hiccups.</Review>
            <Review>This will entertain a wide variety of genre fans from thriller to horror. Don't miss this for sure.</Review>
            <Review>Missing the point of what true grindhouse fans are looking for, don't expect much life to be found in this stale, monotonous, mind-numbing tale, making Biehn's audience the sole victim in this whole debacle</Review>
            <Review>Despite its brief running time it could do with a little tightening up... but as an homage to a very particular style of filmmaking it's a quiet, commendable triumph.</Review>

            <Review>A loud, grating wallow in dime-store despair.</Review>
            <Review>The film is guilty of reverse sentimentality, where the relentless unhappiness comes to seem as manufactured and artificial as the schmaltz in a romcom.</Review>
            <Review>Detachment gets an A for enthusiasm but a C for execution.</Review>
            <Review>There's something weirdly effective about the artistic desperation, which includes inserts of chalkboard animation and to-the-camera testimonials.</Review>

            <Review>Detachment gets to you. It hits hard.</Review>
            <Review>A bizarre, well intentioned mess, at the very least, Detachment is never dull...even as the film is bad, it's compulsively watchable.</Review>
            <Review>It's a film so well paced with a message so relevant that it deserves an audience bigger than what it got and it deserves more of an emotional impact than will resonant throughout.</Review>
            <Review>While Adrien Brody gives it his all in his performance, the film suffers greatly from an attempt to equalize its multiple plotlines.</Review>
            <Review>Even a talented director like Tony Kaye (American History X) and a great performance from Brody can't save a mess like this.</Review>
            <Review>Detachment is the sort of film-of-the-week that ought to appeal to anyone who loves movies in the purest sense.</Review>
            <Review>Detachment has such original energy and is so infused with righteous anger that it proves hard to dismiss.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>The beauty is in the array of animated faces in Anders' life. And it's in the simple promise and vitality of Anders' face, which serves the film without any regard for being in a film, let alone a tragedy or a poetic vision of darkness and futility.</Review>
            <Review>With a predilection for long takes, alternating between tripod setups and handheld camera work that's reflective of Anders' unease, Trier presents life as an unceasingly tepid stream of the mundane -- with an occasional, exquisite pinprick of hope.</Review>
            <Review>The movie transpires mostly in quiet, engrossing dialogue scenes, and its austere style shares a good deal in common with the protagonist, who seems both opaque and completely exposed.</Review>
            <Review>[Displays] an invigoratingly acute understanding of the psychology of insecurity, longing, defensiveness and inward-turning rage.</Review>
            <Review>"Oslo, August 31st" is quietly, profoundly, one of the most observant and sympathetic films I've seen.</Review>
            <Review>A coolly observed yet boundlessly compassionate day in the life of a recovering drug addict, "Oslo, August 31st" breaks your heart many times over.</Review>
            <Review>Devastating. And masterful.</Review>
            <Review>Comprova a promessa representada pela estreia de Joachim Trier.</Review>
            <Review>Sad, but wise, and clear-eyed about what it means to drift through life until it's suddenly too late to turn back.</Review>
            <Review>Life's sadder moments are quite well displayed in Trier's nuanced approach. For many popcorn munchers, that regrettably doesn't translate as a must-see movie in today's crowded marketplace...</Review>
            <Review>It's an absolutely moving and devastating film, and one of the most jarring looks at addiction you'll ever see on screen.</Review>
            <Review>In a single day, through a single pair of eyes, Trier and Lie give us an emblem for the world.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Ice-T takes us on an intimate journey into the heart and soul of hip-hop with the legends of rap music. This performance documentary goes beyond the stardom and the bling to explore what goes on inside the minds, and erupts from the lips, of the grandmasters of rap. Recognized as the godfather of Gangsta rap, Ice-T is granted unparalleled access to the personal lives of the masters of this artform that he credits for saving his life. Interspersed with the performers' insightful, touching, and often funny revelations are classic raps, freestyle rhymes, and never before heard a cappellas straight from the mouths of the creators. What emerges is a better understanding of, and a tribute to, an original American art form that brought poetry to a new generation. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

        <Duration>82</Duration>
        <StoryLine>A richly textured essay film on landscape, art, history, life and loss, Patience (After Sebald) offers a unique exploration of the work and influence of internationally acclaimed writer W.G. Sebald (1944 - 2001). With contributions from major writers, artists and filmmakers, including Adam Philips, Robert Macfarlane, Rick Moody and Tacita Dean, the film is structured around a walk through coastal East Anglia, the same path followed by Sebald in his ground-breaking book, "The Rings of Saturn." Directed by the Grierson Award winning director of Joy Division, Patience is the first film on this important and vital writer, and marks ten years since his untimely death. -- (C) Cinema Guild</StoryLine>

            <Review>The film is finally only an enjoyable tour, almost devoid of the book's resonances.</Review>
            <Review>Sometimes the scenery is breathtaking, but more often the narration lends the landscape an interest it wouldn't otherwise have.</Review>
            <Review>A visionary composition on a series of spoken reflections about a literary work - itself full of layered free-association - Gee's intricate, prismatic film might sound as if it must be buried in abstraction.</Review>
            <Review>In a way, Patience is a lot like how one of its interview subjects describes an attempt to do Sebald's walk: He says he could retrace the steps, but not the experiences, or the revelations.</Review>
            <Review>Curious souls new to this writer will discover a useful introduction (including passages from "The Rings of Saturn," read by the actor Jonathan Pryce) and a handy map.</Review>
            <Review>Retraces Sebald's steps, reuniting the novel's descriptions of actual places and spaces with their images and weaving in illuminating commentary from admirers (Rick Moody, Robert McFarlane).</Review>
            <Review>A fresh, strange, downbeat new entry to the "nonfiction art film" genre.</Review>
            <Review>A wide-ranging piece of literary criticism brought to vivid cinematic life, bursting with ideas and inspired visual translations of them.</Review>
            <Review>Grant Gee's film should make anyone want to read The Rings of Saturn and the rest of Sebald's relatively small but exquisite oeuvre, some eight or nine books in all.</Review>
            <Review>Gee, who made the award-winning Joy Division, conducts his quiet study with considerable skill...</Review>
            <Review>In keeping with the spirit of Sebald's writing, Gee's film is teasing, elegant and perhaps inevitably unresolved: an invitation as opposed to a destination.</Review>

So when Siena's cruel Spanish overlord Don Carlos (Riccardo Garrone) hires him to protect his fianc�e, the beautiful Tuscan noblewoman Lady Orietta (Koscina), Stanwood happily complies. His allegiance soon changes, however, when Orietta's innocent young sister (Christine Kaufmann) is ordered to marry Captain Hugo (Fausto Tozzi), Don Carlos' sadistic cousin. Joining the rebel group known as The Ten, Stanwood enters the deadly horse race of Siena in a daring attempt to rouse the people, depose Don Carlos and claim Orietta as his own.</StoryLine>

        <Title>King Richard and the Crusaders</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 1954</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>113</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Roundly panned when it was first released, this CinemaScope film version of Sir Walter Scott's The Talisman can now be enjoyed on a "high camp" level. George Sanders plays King Richard the Lionhearted, while his arch-foe Saladin is over-acted by Rex Harrison. One of Richard's objectives during the Crusades is to reclaim the Holy Grail from Saladin's Mohammedan hordes. On the home front, Richard must contend with a group of conspirators dedicated to toppling him from his throne. In the middle of all this is the fictional Lady Edith,a British noblewoman played by Virginia Mayo in a manner that can best be described as overbaked. It is Ms. Mayo who delivers the film's classic line "Oh, fight, fight, fight! That's all you ever think of, Dickie Plantagenet!" In his American film debut, Laurence Harvey is as hammy as the rest of the cast as Sir Kenneth, Richard's right-hand man.</StoryLine>

        <Duration>120</Duration>
        <StoryLine>MGM's leading musical team of the 30's, Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy are paired once again in this fourth film version of David Belasco's creaky melodrama, featuring music by Sigmund Romberg and Gus Kahn. Jeanette MacDonald is Mary Robbins, the owner of a bawdy, rough-house saloon in a western mining town, who falls in love with the Mexican bandit Ramerez (Nelson Eddy), who has disguised himself as a cavalry officer. But when local sheriff Jack Rance (Walter Pidgeon) tracks down Ramerez and wounds him, Mary discovers Ramerez's ruse and begs Rance for the outlaw's freedom. The only problem is that Nance is also in love with Mary. Girl of the Golden West was originally tinted in a sepia-tone to create a look as burnished as the MGM production design.</StoryLine>

        <ReleaseDate> 1940</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>106</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Previously filmed in 1930 with Lawrence Tibbett and Grace Moore, the robust Sigmund Romberg operetta New Moon was given another airing in 1940 as Nelson Eddy-Jeanette MacDonald vehicle. Set in 18th century Louisiana, the story concerns the relationship between haughty plantation owner Marianne de Beaumanoir (MacDonald) and her handsome bondservant Charles (Eddy). Actually a French nobleman in disguise, Charles leads his fellow bondsman in revolt, commandeering a ship and heading out to sea. He ends up capturing a vessel carrying Marianne and a cargo of mail-order brides. Though the bondsmen and the brides get along just fine, the romance between Marianne and Charles is noticeably strained, but the French Revolution comes along to solve everyone's problems. The soaring Romberg musical score includes such favorites as "One Kiss", "Stout-Hearted Men" and "Lover Come Back to Me", all performed con brio by the stars. Comedian Buster Keaton, whose supporting role was cut from the final release print of New Moon, can still be glimpsed among the bondsmen.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Ultra-gory horror comedy squanders its intriguing premise of crime-stopping vigilante zombies with its uneven execution.</Review>
            <Review>It's not hard to imagine this becoming a cult favorite.</Review>
            <Review>About 30 minutes too long and somewhat clumsily executed, this zombie's-eye-view story still manages to evoke the comic and splattery spirit of the best '80s cult horror flicks.</Review>
            <Review>This small sleeper delivers a surprising number of pleasingly putrid punch lines.</Review>
            <Review>Its anti-war sentiments are trafficked in like a subterfuge that blows up with unexpected force.</Review>
            <Review>By the middle of the second hour, you'll be wishing a zombie would just chomp off your head to end the pain.</Review>
            <Review>one of the more unique approaches to such a story</Review>
            <Review>The Revenant is a refreshing spin on the vampire/zombie genre and a true hidden gem.</Review>
            <Review>The Revenant is full of life and displays magnificent story telling from both a writing and directorial sense. It is one of the smarter horror comedies created in the past few years and well worth a watch.</Review>
            <Review>It's the best successor to Cemetery Man out there, for sure (much better than Dylan Dog!).</Review>
            <Review>Ghoulishly repetitive and gore-laden, it's a flimsy fright farce that eventually becomes the walking dud.</Review>

            <Review>Ranks among one of the most wryly self-aware works of American pop culture entertainment in years.</Review>
            <Review>The filmmakers are less interested in providing a slow buildup to their frights than in splattering the clichés of the form in funny, spirited ways.</Review>
            <Review>In order to subvert any popular form, entertainment first has to work on its own terms. Goddard and Whedon are too busy geeking out to bother with those requirements.</Review>
            <Review>The setup is intriguing but the balance feels off. Goddard and Whedon overplay the winking postmodernism.</Review>
            <Review>One of the best movies of 2012 so far, in any genre.</Review>
            <Review>By the time the ride is over, director Drew Goddard and co-writers Goddard and Joss Whedon will change course three or four times, nodding and winking but never losing momentum.</Review>
            <Review>Crazy, totally, and deliriously fun.</Review>
            <Review>The target audience is clearly horror geeks with a clear knowledge of the genre and its cliches. But if you are one of those people, then you'll probably not enjoy a movie more this year.</Review>
            <Review>Certainly one of my favourite films of the year so far and a must-see for anyone wanting to be genuinely shocked by the places a walk in a dark, dark wood can take you.</Review>
            <Review>Drew Goddard, with assistance from his cohort scenarist Joss Whedon, achieves an exemplary fusion of horror, humour and science-fiction while undermining genre conventions and audience expectations alike.</Review>
            <Review>[Whedon finds] an inventive way to subvert the genre with a re-twist of the dreaded knife of horror, and a very acute Big Brother eye.</Review>
            <Review>I think you'll find that your visit to the genre-bending The Cabin In The Woods will prove to be one of the most unabashedly enjoyable trips in years. I hope you enjoy the ride.</Review>

He contends with an aristocratic, spendthrift mother (Valeria de Franciscis); a wife who is more patronizing friend than romantic partner; a daughter (played by Di Gregorio's daughter Teresa) with a slacker boyfriend whom Gianni unwillingly befriends; and a wild young neighbor who sees him merely as her dog walker. Watching his "codger" friends snare beautiful younger women on the sun-kissed cobblestones of Trastevere, Gianni tries his polite, utterly gracious best to generate some kind of extracurricular love life-with both hilarious and poignant results. -- (C) Zeitgeist</StoryLine>

            <Review>Italian film has done us another favor-it has sent us Gianni Di Gregorio again.</Review>
            <Review>Italian writer/director/comedian Gianni Di Gregorio plays browbeaten family men brilliantly, and in this film he's given himself a fine showcase.</Review>
            <Review>At times, the sad sights are enough to make a person hope the put-upon guy finds success. The problem is, as affable as Giovanni is, there's not much more to him.</Review>
            <Review>Episodically structured and lethargically paced, the new film attempts to convince us that there's something incredibly charming about an old guy who makes a habit of ogling young women. Actually, the whole scenario is pretty creepy.</Review>
            <Review>Though you can empathize with Gianni's loneliness, the lecherous buffoon is too much of a stock type to feel fresh. At times, the comedy is shamelessly broad.</Review>
            <Review>"The Salt of Life" finds gentle comedy in the dilemma of a still warm-blooded if sexually marginalized fellow for whom kindness is second nature and lecherousness is alien.</Review>
            <Review>For all its gentle charm, the movie is undeniably slow, and many viewers will not have patience for it.</Review>
            <Review>Love and beautiful women are the fragrant themes of this charmer of a comedy in which director, writer and star Gianni Di Gregorio explores the reality and the dreams of a man stuck in a rut of everyday life.</Review>
            <Review>An extraordinary and universal Italian film about a 60-year-old man's mid-life crisis and the sapping of his spirit.</Review>
            <Review>A sweet-natured, bittersweet little movie -- and I mean little -- about growing old.</Review>
            <Review>By acknowledging that younger and older women might be wiser than he is, Di Gregorio takes what could have been a shallow excuse for self-pity and has managed to milk the setup for all the laughs it can generate.</Review>
            <Review>Di Gregorio has a low-key, unaffected charm that makes it remarkably easy to relate to his semi-autobiographical movies.</Review>

            <Review>"Munger Road" does an efficient, skillful job of audience manipulation using the techniques of darkness and vulnerability, and the truth that a horror not seen is almost always scarier than one you can see.</Review>
            <Review>Using the less-is-more approach, Nicholas Smith builds the film to an effective and suspenseful climax. But then, Munger Road stops abruptly and annoyingly with a "to be continued." Really?</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>This Paris-based film from Polish director Malgorzata Szumowska is a fairly unengaging journalism procedural shellacked with a veneer of elliptical, complicated symbolism.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director Malgorzata Szumowska breaks past the facile moralizing only once.</Review>
            <Review>"Elles" has a surprisingly deep performance in a disappointingly shallow movie.</Review>
            <Review>Binoche is the disappointment. More than half the problem is that the script, co-written by the director, gives her little to do but fret and mope.</Review>
            <Review>One of her (Binoche's) lesser choices.</Review>
            <Review>Both provocative and muddled, the film's a moody, passive-aggressive tract that's buoyed by superior performances and sunk by its own uncertainties.</Review>
            <Review>You could hardly think of a racier subject and a more meandering, listless movie.</Review>
            <Review>Elles is undeniably challenging, courageously delving into some immensely messy issues surrounding sexuality and the ways men and women barter in relationships.</Review>
            <Review>Polish director Małgorzata Szumowska deserves some sort of award for making such a potentially spell-binding topic so flat.</Review>
            <Review>I can't tell what Elles has to say and I rather think the filmmakers don't either</Review>
            <Review>There is an element of voyeurism and titillation by design that seeps out in the realisation of the narrative</Review>

            <Review>The ambition is laudable even if the execution isn't as smooth or detailed as it might have been.</Review>
            <Review>Plodding, somewhat misbegotten, and never slick enough to sweep us along.</Review>
            <Review>There's a lovely frisson between Bean and Rampling that makes you think what James Bond and M could be.</Review>
            <Review>The film certainly has ambition and there are some memorable fight scenes, but it also lacks the extra oomph that could have done for Bean's action-movie career what Taken did for Liam Neeson's.</Review>
            <Review>It's perhaps one credibility-straining twist too many for the film, which up until then does a solid job of aping slicker, bigger-budgeted Hollywood thrillers.</Review>
            <Review>A slick action drama with a strong cast, including Tuppence Middleton, Charlotte Rampling and Michelle Ryan, that delivers in terms of violence, gunplay and conspiracy thrills.</Review>
            <Review>It's a competent, conventional thriller, but there's something suspiciously unbalanced going on here.</Review>
            <Review>As a rather far-fetched work of faction, Cleanskin left me feeling rather grubby about the world that we live in - and not entertained.</Review>
            <Review>This isn't a film for everyone, but for those who can take Cleanskin's political posturing with a grain of salt, there's quite a bit to enjoy here.</Review>
            <Review>This film is just okay. It is absolutely fine for a single watch, but I cannot see anyone checking this film out and producing the cash to add it to their collection.</Review>
            <Review>You couldn't ever accuse Hadi Hajaig's film of being one-sided: it has two, both of them stupid.</Review>
            <Review>As if we don't have enough gullible folk believing 7/7 and 9/11 conspiracy theories already, this poor thriller comes along to popularise the paranoia.</Review>

            <Review>There's much to admire about Panos Cosmatos' directorial debut, but the end result is admittedly not for all tastes.</Review>
            <Review>The movie looks like it was lit by lava lamps, scored on Moog synthesizers, written between bong hits and acted underwater. None of this is meant as praise.</Review>
            <Review>"Beyond the Black Rainbow" has a doomy, dreamy, druggy, draggy feel that's impressively sustained - until it becomes oppressive, then pointless, then laughable.</Review>
            <Review>Much of the time, watching Beyond the Black Rainbow is accompanied by head scratching, but perhaps that's the point of this trippy outing.</Review>
            <Review>Close-ups of a needle penetrating gnarled toes and a mutant slathered in what I choose to believe is bittersweet chocolate make as much sense as the scary drawings of angry vulvas hiding in a drawer.</Review>
            <Review>This would-be cult classic is the movie equivalent of gazing at a lava lamp for nearly two hours.</Review>
            <Review>A film for people who might call Stalker their favorite movie of all time if only it were more opaque. So, you know, a little audience, but a passionate one.</Review>
            <Review>Part Cronenberg, part Bava, and part De Palma ... It's a film that manages to feel both new and long-forgotten at the same time.</Review>
            <Review>The rich and strange debut of Panos Cosmatos throbs with style and portent, which proves a winning combination even if it is somewhat light in the narrative department.</Review>
            <Review>Audiences who appreciate oddball first efforts from talents such as Lynch (Eraserhead), Cronenberg (Shivers) and Jeunet (Delicatessen) will be thankful.</Review>
            <Review>If you follow the muddled spacy film's logic throughout, you deserve a merit honor badge for devotion to service beyond the call of duty.</Review>

            <Review>It's such a mopey, navel-gazing affair that even Gerwig has a hard time saving it.</Review>
            <Review>An extremely smart, exquisitely funny film about finding yourself amid the clang and clutter of contemporary life.</Review>
            <Review>Lola Versus is all Greta all the time, a bonanza for fans and proof that Gerwig's easy offbeat charm, obvious smarts and physical comedy gifts can carry a film.</Review>
            <Review>There's a Fitzgeraldian sense of generational malaise in all of this, but "Lola Versus" is convinced that it's hilarious.</Review>
            <Review>It's a wonder Gerwig manages to keep the character endearing instead of grating, but she does.</Review>
            <Review>I didn't dislike this movie because I'm a man. I generally disliked this movie because I felt the main character was a bit pathetic.</Review>
            <Review>Lola Versus has plenty of potential, but with a script that has absolutely no handle on its lead character, the experience quickly becomes unbearably frustrating.</Review>
            <Review>More enjoyable than it ought to be.</Review>

            <Review>As generic as the title, this historical drama spares no cliche in depicting Mexico's Cristero War of the late 1920.</Review>
            <Review>It's the stuff of real life, and of high drama, but Dean Wright's directorial debut translates little of that latter quality to the screen.</Review>
            <Review>"For Greater Glory" is at times so heavy-handed that the movie itself seems at war. Unfortunately, the enemy is not just a repressive administration, but the audience.</Review>
            <Review>Despite enough good intentions to pave a four-lane highway, the ardently sincere but dramatically unfocused For Greater Glory plays like a multipart miniseries that has been hacked down to feature length.</Review>
            <Review>This historical drama about the little-known Cristero War in 1920s Mexico is more educational than involving.</Review>
            <Review>The sometimes painfully sincere and slow-moving "For Greater Glory" clearly aspires to be inspirational, but history won't cooperate.</Review>
            <Review>For Greater Glory takes what should have been an involving, even shocking hidden part of history and turns it into a needless epic</Review>
            <Review>"For Greater Glory" takes its cues from a bygone era of Technicolor Golden Age epics and delivers a sprawling political drama steeped in old-fashioned Hollywood romanticism.</Review>
            <Review>The compelling archival footage, which literally made me gasp aloud, and the incredible, disturbing photos are amazing. Unfortunately, you'll see them only during the end credits of 'For Greater Glory.'</Review>
            <Review>It's the kind of now-obscure subject matter that could be fascinating if done well, but here just feels like an obligation. And yeah there's going to be a test, so good luck at not falling asleep in class.</Review>

To prevent a world wide crisis, the Vatican's spokesman calls in an unlikely psychiatrist who is neither religious or all that committed, played by Moretti, to find out what is wrong with the new Pope. As the world nervously waits outside, inside the therapist tries to find a solution. But Cardinal Melville is adamant: he does not want the job, or at least needs time to think it over. What follows is a marvelous insight into the concept of a human being existing behind the title of God's representative on Earth. -- (C) IFC</StoryLine>

            <Review>Always the star of his movies, even when he shouldn't be, the atheist Moretti gets caught up in his own papal bull. But Piccoli's blessed empathy prevails.</Review>
            <Review>This is rich material that Moretti mines for both superficial absurdity and deep pathos. But he refuses to forge an orthodox happy ending, let alone a tinny satire.</Review>
            <Review>We Have a Pope takes its shots at the institution of the Catholic Church, but this is by no means a scathing satire. It's more of a character study, insightful and nuanced, about a man grappling with a profound sense of inadequacy, questioning himself.</Review>
            <Review>Though skeptical, the film isn't at all mean-spirited.</Review>
            <Review>"We Have a Pope" is a nuanced, moving and profoundly humane exploration of doubt, faith, weakness and resolve.</Review>
            <Review>"We Have a Pope" has great heart.</Review>
            <Review>Director and star Moretti is improbably likable as a sometimes smug psychiatrist. The entire supporting cast is composed of character actors with extraordinarily expressive faces. But the standout is Michel Piccoli in the lead.</Review>
            <Review>While We Have a Pope contains an interesting idea for a film, it ultimately fails to portray the struggle Cardinal Melville is going through, which is the centerpiece of the entire film.</Review>
            <Review>This is certainly a great idea for a film, it just needs better execution, less stalling for and wasting of time, and a better means of showing the difficult period that Cardinal Melville is going through.</Review>
            <Review>To its great credit, just before the credits, We Have A Pope slips away from its droll dramedy and offers a sharp anticlimax--a pointed stab at Catholicism now. The declaration of its title turns out to be the emptiest statement of all.</Review>
            <Review>Such slapstick actually works, reminding us that the clergy are people, too, and the Vatican runs on electricity instead of a higher power.</Review>
            <Review>While Moretti is as secular as the character he plays in the film, he gives us a papal portrait that's nuanced and counterintuitive; we're used to the humanity of popes evinced as Borgian lust and avarice, not as self-doubt and humility.</Review>

            <Review>Technically the genre isn't beneath contempt. But this movie is.</Review>
            <Review>Bringing a child into the world is no laughing matter, and all involved seem to have done their level best to make things as mirthless as possible.</Review>
            <Review>Babies are cute and expectant parents often aren't. That kind of sums up What to Expect When You're Expecting.</Review>
            <Review>Director Kirk Jones and screenwriters Shauna Cross and Heather Hach consistently fall back on corny music and slow-motion to try to get laughs. Very little of this movie feels risky, or even frisky.</Review>
            <Review>Patently contrived to deliver the safer side of pregnancy-related humor over the course of five tidily intersecting plot lines.</Review>
            <Review>Remember when advice books stayed on the shelves where they belonged?</Review>
            <Review>Diaz's plotline seems to revolve solely around an argument with Morrison over the merits of circumcision. She's pro-cut. He's fanatically anti-cut. Clearly, as is the film's editor.</Review>
            <Review>What to Expect When You're Expecting provides a snapshot of contemporary anxieties about imminent parenthood, but it may be more worthwhile as a document for future pop culture scholars to use to understand what was trendy in 2012.</Review>
            <Review>The charismatic cast (particularly Banks and Lopez) manage to find the humanity in their clichéd roles but they can't transcend all the surface-level schmaltz on display here.</Review>
            <Review>Provides good chuckles and heartfelt drama - paired with an equal amount of familiar gags and flat story ideas.</Review>
            <Review>What To Expect When You're Expecting delivers a stale plot, mostly underwritten characters and almost no joy. Expect little and you may not be entirely disappointed.</Review>
            <Review>The highs, lows, unexpected joys and totally expected pains of pregnancy get a comprehensive going over in this consistently funny, warm-hearted ensemble comedy.</Review>

            <Review>This spirited troupe of women ... makes us citizens of the village, invested in their joys and fears. We grieve with them, under that burning sun, and hope with them for a lasting peace.</Review>
            <Review>"Where Do We Go Now?" is more interesting than satisfying.</Review>
            <Review>With elements of a musical, a melodrama and a multicultural romance, "Where Do We Go Now?" is as hard to define as the crossroads region where it's set.</Review>
            <Review>This is energetic, bursting with sincerity, yet also frustrating and disappointing.</Review>
            <Review>It is, at times, a charming reprieve from the usually dour cinematic explorations of Middle Eastern conflicts.</Review>
            <Review>Labaki never claimed to be Noël Coward, but the facile comedy leads to a dilution of the message she strives so strenuously to make.</Review>
            <Review>A ramshackle curiosity of a film, poorly made and more admirable in intent than execution.</Review>
            <Review>Drugs, exotic dancers, dodgy deities. This certainly isn't your usual po-faced, worthy Middle Eastern tale.</Review>
            <Review>Part religiopolitical satire, part smalltown sitcom, with a hint of romance, Where Do We Go Now? is pleasingly populated with "characters" and light farce that occasionally breaks out into a movie musical.</Review>
            <Review>... a mess, but a cheerful one.</Review>
            <Review>It's a "what if" story that's hopeful but doesn't ring true.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is set in a remote Lebanese village, but it's all over the map in terms of content and style. The elements never cohere, resulting in a film more admirable for its pacifist yearnings than for its execution.</Review>

            <Review>Theron gives the picture some spine. As Snow White, Kristen Stewart supplies the heart.</Review>
            <Review>Strong effects, good design, and an exciting use of nature help to empower Stewart and Theron, who inject a rich, double dose of feminism.</Review>
            <Review>If you don't walk out of the movie (as I was sorely tempted to do) you'll eventually get to meet the seven dwarfs... This touch of whimsy is welcome but comes too late to rescue the dark-hearted movie.</Review>
            <Review>As far as live-action reimaginings of fairy tales are concerned, this is one of the more inventive ones and is unquestionably better than 2011's Red Riding Hood misfire.</Review>
            <Review>Vastly superior to Mirror, Mirror in every way. Great work from Charlize Theron.</Review>
            <Review>Sanders does not (yet) share Guillermo del Toro's gifts, but he, too, has an eye for the beautiful and the grotesque, and for that entrancing borderline where the two meet.</Review>
            <Review>Overly long and slow-moving, it's serious and ponderous from the get go, and doesn't really change gear until its underwhelming climax.</Review>
            <Review>This Snow White may not be the fairest of them all, but sometimes, especially during the heat of summer, fair-to-middling does just fine.</Review>
            <Review>Like its vain Queen, it's so enamored of its own mirror image that it's hard to see past the style and get lost in the story. But as sheer spectacle, it delivers the goods.</Review>
            <Review>Ostracized teacher fights to clear his name after false child molestation accusation.</Review>
            <Review>Director Rupert Sanders and actress Charlize help elevate this otherwise forgettable fairy tale.</Review>

        <StoryLine>In Goats, Ellis (Graham Phillips) is the most adult member of his eccentric family at 15 years old. His mom (Vera Farmiga) is a New Age hippie that spends all of her time working on self-help rituals with her hustler boyfriend (Justin Kirk). His dad (Ty Burrell) left home years ago and is more focused on his new wife (Keri Russell) and family. And then there's Goat Man (David Duchovny), the goat-herding sage who has lived in their pool house since Ellis was a child, teaching him the meaning of stability, commitment, and expanding one's mind. When Ellis decides to leave Tucson to go to the same East Coast prep school that his father went to, he easily assimilates to his new environment - even gaining the attention of a local girl (Dakota Johnson). But as he re&amp;#8208;connects with his estranged father, he finds Goat Man's influence and his life out West thrown into stark contrast. -- (C) Image</StoryLine>

            <Review>A couple of scenes - especially one with a cop with a heart - are touching. Depending on your point of view, October Baby does manage to score more than a few points.</Review>
            <Review>The filmmaking is lugubrious and heavy-handed, and the dramatic arc stagnant and airless.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Richard Burton seethes and barks as Vic Dakin, an unsavory British underworld thug with a mother fixation that only James Cagney's Cody Jarrett from White Heat would appreciate, in this Michael Tuchner-directed crime drama. Vic is bound and gagged to his dying mum (Cathleen Nesbit) with such an intensity that his only outlet outside of his mother's bedroom is by plying a handy razor blade or rooting around in the homosexual rough trade. But Vic is rough enough himself and, when he hatches a plot to rob a payroll, he takes to one of his recruited goons, Wolf Lissner (Ian McShane), in a way that demonstrates his true love for him -- he berates him, slaps him around, and then takes him to bed. Unfortunately for Vic's psychotic anti-social tendencies, a dedicated police inspector, Bob Matthews (Nigel Davenport) has devoted his life to finding something on Vic to put him in the slammer forever. And this heist may be just the ticket.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Engaging but slight torture-porn flick.</Review>
            <Review>All the performances are good.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Based on a novel by Winston Graham, The Walking Stick stars Samantha Eggar as Deborah, a polio-stricken woman courted by charming artist Leigh Hartley (David Hemmings). She moves in with Leigh, who immediately suggests that she help him rob the antique store where she works. Her common sense clouded by love, Deborah agrees. She is laboring under the misapprehension that Leigh will use the stolen loot to open up their own antique shop. He of course has no such intention, having orchestrated the whole romance for his own greedy gain. Both Samantha Eggar and David Hemmings are too talented for the sluggish goings-on in The Walking Stick, but actors do have to eat once in a while. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>Cameron has devised a tender love story between Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio that serves as the main focus of Titanic's storyline, and it works beautifully.</Review>
            <Review>If computer-generated special effects have overpowered human-generated drama, Cameron seizes that dangerously cold technology and recasts it as dream and delirium, profoundly human in its sources and longings.</Review>
            <Review>The execution is state-of-the-art and breathtaking. Titanic offers the full compass of courage and cowardice, and it stands as an achievement that truly is a night to remember at the movies.</Review>
            <Review>Titanic provides an absorbing blend of historical fact and old-fashioned Hollywood tearjerking.</Review>
            <Review>Titanic is indeed a ship of dreams. Climb aboard and bon voyage.</Review>
            <Review>Take one of history's most compelling tragedies, tell it through the lives of two engaging young lovers and show it with some of the best-ever special effects and you have a dazzling, exciting movie that is also poignant and personal.</Review>
            <Review>DiCaprio and Winslet both deliver star-making performances.</Review>
            <Review>It's a technically magnificent and emotionally wrenching experience.</Review>
            <Review>Titanic is an awesome achievement, a traditional Hollywood epic that dazzles your eyes, breaks your heart and shivers your soul.</Review>
            <Review>DiCaprio manages a good mix of youthful bravado and nervous uncertainty... And Winslet shines as a willful rich girl who discovers her sensual side with this earthy urchin.</Review>
            <Review>Titanic 3D lacks creative synergy that could have been explored had the film been shot with 3D in mind but its easily the best example of post-conversion to date.</Review>

            <Review>Flatly shot and lit like a cable-TV movie, with a mismatched Franken-score of flowery flourishes and suspense-feigning propulsion, On the 7th Day sadly contains some fine, earnest acting...</Review>
            <Review>This overplotted, underwritten, powerfully dumb soap-thriller has more professionalism than it deserves.</Review>
            <Review>This tawdry, faith-based kidnapping melodrama has a lot to atone for.</Review>
            <Review>A contrived and preachy melodrama produced by big-time televangelist T.D. Jakes.</Review>
            <Review>"Woman" is in essence an earnestly competent, slightly overcooked B-movie potboiler, with ideas of faith occasionally added to frame the story as parable.</Review>
            <Review>Hysterically overwrought.</Review>
            <Review>As hard as the cast works in turning in solid performances, they fight a losing battle against the largely uninspired story.</Review>
            <Review>In bad melodrama, the instant a woman says "You are such a good man, David," to her husband, you know that he isn't.</Review>
            <Review>Perhaps director Neema Barnette was hired to insulate the movie from charges of misogyny; in the end, On the 7th Day is not about women being "loosed" from the past, but tying those bonds a whole lot tighter.</Review>

        <Title>Holy Flying Circus</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2011</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>90</Duration>
        <StoryLine>In 1979, Britain's most beloved comedy troupe, Monty Python (John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Michael Palin and Terry Jones) made film history when they teamed up with producer George Harrison to create the blissfully irreverent Biblical comedy The Life of Brian. Though the movie was a critical and commercial hit, it also stirred up torrents of indignation, particularly from Christian groups who found it transparently offensive. The Pythons disagreed, and even argued that the film contained a highly religious message buried in its comedy. Things came to a boil when Cleese and Palin participated in a talk show aired by a Catholic broadcaster and featuring a Bishop from the Church of England. This 2011 docudrama travels back to the late 1970s to recreate many of the events surrounding the film's controversy, including that famous talk show appearance. It stars Steve Punt as Idle, Charles Edwards as Palin, Rufus Jones as Jones, Phil Nichol as Gilliam, Darren Boyd as Cleese and Thomas Fisher as Chapman.</StoryLine>

        <Title>My Sucky Teen Romance</Title>
        <ReleaseDate/>
        <Duration>80</Duration>
        <StoryLine>A girl discovers her dreamy new boyfriend wants more from the relationship than she expected -- namely blood -- in this teen-centric horror comedy. Cute but geeky Kate (Elaine Hurt) has a crush on Paul (Patrick Delgado), a good looking guy who works at the grocery where her family shops, and when she attends SpaceCon (an event for comic, sci-fi and fantasy fans) with her friends, she's pleased to see he's there as well. Kate is even happier when Paul wants some private time with her, but a kiss gives way to a bite on the neck, and Kate learns that Paul isn't pretending to be a vampire like many folks at the Con, he's the real thing. Paul became a blood sucker after a run-in with Vince (Devin Bonnee), an angst-y vampire the ladies swoon over, but both Paul and Kate have mixed feelings about being creatures of the night. When Kate's pal Jason (Santiago Dietche), who carries a torch for her, puts together the pieces and realizes what's happened, he sets out to rescue Kate from the vampires before it's too late. My Sucky Teen Romance was written and directed by Emily Hagins, who was just eighteen years old when the project was wrapped; it received its world premiere at the 2011 South by Southwest Film Festival.</StoryLine>

            <Review>The occasional efficient action sequence means that 'Safe' never gets truly dull, but even Statham aficionados might feel short- changed by this one.</Review>
            <Review>The thoroughly mediocre Safe provides little more than an excuse for Statham to do what Statham does better than anyone else: look stern while punishing bad guys. That's just not enough.</Review>
            <Review>It's like another "Transporter'' installment trying to be something slightly more - and not quite delivering the goods.</Review>
            <Review>Despite some impressively gritty street-level action, Safe plays it far too safe.</Review>
            <Review>Yeah, "Safe" is a long way from perfect. But rented, in a few months, it'll go great with a six-pack and a hold-the-anchovies special.</Review>
            <Review>It's hard to swallow Statham, who spent the Crank movies supercharging his last minutes of life, as a suicidal sad-sack, just as it's painful to see him yoked to a cute little girl in an obvious attempt to soften his image.</Review>
            <Review>An action film so cack-handed it borders on parody.</Review>
            <Review>Overall, Safe is terribly glum and resolutely average.</Review>
            <Review>It ain't too smart, it ain't too sophisticated, but it does have its charm and is entertaining enough for what it is: an action-packed, B-movie experience.</Review>
            <Review>Character development and storyline are treated as inconveniences to be tossed aside at the earliest opportunity.</Review>
            <Review>Safe is an exceptional Jason Statham B-movie that managed to sneak through the cracks during its theatrical release.</Review>
            <Review>Perhaps one of these days Statham will stop making the same movie over and over and try something new.</Review>

            <Review>This is a watchable but rather drab romcom which relies too often on Apatow-school cliché.</Review>
            <Review>An exemplary modern romantic comedy, personal and symbolic, goofy and substantial, tightly imagined yet loosely strung, wise in bewilderment.</Review>
            <Review>Like Apatow's "Funny People," the film is an intentional hybrid: half gag comedy, half open-ended exploration of everything that can go wrong -- and occasionally right -- between two people whom nature, if not society, means to be together.</Review>
            <Review>A charming, funny, reactionary mating comedy from the Judd Apatow factory...</Review>
            <Review>A fun, entertaining picture, and another credit to Segel's rising career as a writer and star.</Review>
            <Review>[It] feels poignant and real in a way few raunch comedies are.</Review>
            <Review>Probably should have just focused on the Chris Pratt and Alison Brie characters.</Review>
            <Review>More often, the movie reduces everything to sitcom levels of tidiness and routine.</Review>
            <Review>You'd be challenged to laugh once during a two-hour-plus slog in which much of the intended hilarity resides in frequent utterances of the F-bomb, venison and Wham! posters.</Review>
            <Review>It's a bit over-stuffed, but the narrative does come full-circle and successfully balances charming comedy gags grounded in a memorable and contemporary love story.</Review>
            <Review>You'll definitely laugh and it's hard to resist the adorableness factor of Blunt and Segel.</Review>
            <Review>Thank goodness for a fine cast of comedic actors. Even when the comedy gets draggy, the confidence and likability of its two stars keeps the film from completely sinking.</Review>

            <Review>The first half of the film merely treads water in anticipation for the eventual bloodbath, and once the teeth start gnawing, it's just one laborious machination after another to get to the end of the movie, which stops without much of a resolution.</Review>

            <Review>Gulager ... mostly seems to be trying to see how much he can degrade the old Jaws formula and still have it interpreted as parody rather than apathy.</Review>

            <Review>It's not outrageous enough to warrant a you-gotta-see-this-to-believe-it screening, and the gore is nothing that gore fans haven't seen a hundred times before.</Review>
            <Review>This movie looks like it was shot in 1989 and cobbled together randomly.</Review>
            <Review>The picture's biggest sin (or biggest achievement) is the fact that it manages to be stunningly short yet still have several flat, boring stretches.</Review>

        <Duration>76</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Vegucated is a guerrilla-style documentary that follows three meat- and cheese-loving New Yorkers who agree to adopt a vegan diet for six weeks and learn what it's all about. They have no idea that so much more than steak is at stake and that the planet's fate may fall on their plates. Lured by tales of weight lost and health regained, they begin to uncover hidden sides of animal agriculture that make them wonder whether solutions offered in films like Food, Inc. go far enough. Before long, they find themselves risking everything to expose an industry they supported just weeks before. But can their convictions carry them through when times get tough? What about on family vacations fraught with skeptical step-dads, carnivorous cousins, and breakfast buffets? Part sociological experiment and part adventure comedy, Vegucated showcases the rapid and at times comedic evolution of three people who are trying their darnedest to change in a culture that seems dead set against it.</StoryLine>

When violence and crime finds its way to him and his family, Izek (played by Yuda Levi) and his family relocate to Los Angeles. Hoping to start anew, he pursues his ambitions. Success seems to find him at every turn and after falling in love with the beautiful Aline (Delphine Chan�ac), Lady luck seems to be on his side.

        <Title>The Pinochet Case</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2001</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>110</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Between 1973 and 1990, nearly 1,200 Chilean political dissidents who dared to speak out against tyrannical dictator Augusto Pinochet "disappeared" from their homes, to be tortured and executed by government-backed death squads. After Pinochet lost control of Chile's military in 1990, he fled the country, and in 1998, while visiting England to receive medical treatment, he was arrested by British authorities acting on a Spanish warrant for Pinochet's crimes against humanity. El Cas Pinochet is a documentary that presents the facts in the case against Pinochet, featuring interviews with researchers and activists who have documented the brutality of the dictator's reign of terror and who discuss the importance of bringing him to justice, as well as conversations with friends and relatives of some of the "disappeared" and the testimony of the handful of death squad victims who survived their ordeal. El Cas Pinochet was shown at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival as part of the International Critics Week series.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Illuminating.</Review>
            <Review>The determination of Pinochet's victims to seek justice, and their often heartbreaking testimony, spoken directly into director Patricio Guzman's camera, pack a powerful emotional wallop.</Review>
            <Review>It ultimately stands forth as an important chronicle of the abuses of one of Latin America's most oppressive regimes.</Review>
            <Review>The Pinochet Case is a searing album of remembrance from those who, having survived, suffered most.</Review>
            <Review>All the while, in newsreel footage, Pinochet struts around pompously in his absurd, operatic uniform, keeping Chile safe. For whom?</Review>
            <Review>Aside from stumbling over some clunky visual metaphors Guzmán does a decent job of telling a story many outside Chile simply don't know.</Review>
            <Review>The powerless wait a long time for justice, and sometimes their only justice is to finally tell their story.</Review>
            <Review>Can't seem to get anywhere near the story's center.</Review>
            <Review>Like all great documentaries, The Pinochet Case illustrates a universal pattern, in this case a frightening fact of human survival that leads repeatedly to unspeakable tyranny.</Review>
            <Review>Guzman's powerful and sometimes triumphant documentary is not only an excellent overview of the affair, but serves as the perfect finale to the monumental trilogy about the coup and its aftermath.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Leon Prochnik adapted the evocative Robert Moresco play Child's Play for the screen, with Sidney Lumet assuming directorial duties. Beau Bridges stars as a young teacher at an exclusive Catholic boy's boarding school named Paul Reis. An outbreak of violence and brutality among the students has Reis perplexed. He suspects that one of the older professors is responsible for inciting the mayhem. The two most likely suspects, played by James Mason and Robert Preston, are long-standing rivals who blame each other for the student turmoil. One of the old enemies goes so far as to discredit the other -- but his motives are at great odds with the religious doctrine taught within the school's walls. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>The day after soon-to-be valedictorian Henry Burke (Matt Bush) takes a hit of the chronic for the first time, his school principal (Michael Chiklis) institutes a zero tolerance drug policy and administers a mandatory drug test for all students. Henry has two options: fail and lose his college scholarship, or team up with his stoner friend Breaux (Sean Marquette) to beat the system. They steal a high powered ganja from law student-turned-drug-dealer Psycho Ed (Adrien Brody) and spike the school's bake sale brownies, getting the whole school-faculty included-completely stoned out of their minds. But with the student body getting higher and higher with every brownie, and a pissed-off Psycho Ed on their tails for stealing his stash, they must find a way to keep their half-baked plan from going up in smoke. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>If it ever opens at a theater near you, remember: Just say no.</Review>
            <Review>I'm betting director John Stalberg Jr. also debated calling it "Bake Sale," revolving as it does around the mass-dosing of the student body with pot brownies.</Review>
            <Review>The only good news for everyone involved: The worst moment in your career is surely behind you.</Review>
            <Review>It's a bit crude, a lot illogical and you might have to be in a certain state of mind to enjoy a film this silly.</Review>
            <Review>High School definitely won't be everyone's flavor of pot comedy, but it's certainly a fun trip and a clever spin on the genre.</Review>
            <Review>Surprisingly solid and funny... It's rare for a stoner comedy to have so much ambition.</Review>
            <Review>A hot mess whose sub-par direction mostly neutralizes its fantastic comedic premise. High School is a willfully 'stupid' stoner comedy, yes, but it also illustrates the gap between stupid done right and merely indulged too far.</Review>
            <Review>HIGH School isn't exactly Harold and Kumar-level genius, but it is worth the legal risk.</Review>
            <Review>After an amusing start, this film seems to forget it's a pot comedy.</Review>
            <Review>While the movie is insistently unfunny, it's almost tragic how badly director John Stalberg Jr. fumbles the potential for a wacked-out farce, refusing to let loose with the boys as they scramble to maintain order.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Acclaimed director Mary Harron returns with the chilling story of Rebecca (Sarah Bolger), a young girl who, haunted by her father's suicide, enrolls in an elite boarding school for girls. Before long, Rebecca's friendship with the popular Lucy (Sarah Gadon) is shattered by the arrival of a dark and mysterious new student named Ernessa (Lily Cole). Rebecca, whose overtures of concern are rejected by Lucy, finds herself lost and confused. Rebecca starts to suspect that Ernessa is a vampire, but, despite the suspicious deaths that begin to occur, her fears are treated as simple girlish jealousy. As the bodies of young girls pile up and the line between reality and the supernatural starts to blur, Rebecca decides to take matters into her own hands and get rid of Ernessa. -- (C) IFC</StoryLine>

            <Review>Roiling with jealousy, suicide and latent lesbian urges, "The Moth Diaries" dances on the border between hallucination and reality without fully committing to either.</Review>
            <Review>The Moth Diaries fails to frighten, titillate or otherwise engage the imagination.</Review>
            <Review>Harron can do little with this bloodless drama, a shadow of such quiet vampire treats as "Let the Right One In" and "The Addiction."</Review>
            <Review>Harron, a supremely intelligent adaptor who did wonders with the screen version of Bret Easton Ellis' American Psycho, simply doesn't have the chops to give this story the florid kick it needs.</Review>
            <Review>Where are the shivers? The girls are properly fragile, ethereal and neurotic, but the way Ms. Harron gingerly moves them around like porcelain dolls is too careful to stir up much terror.</Review>
            <Review>Vamps-fans won't find much to gnaw on here.</Review>
            <Review>I'd give this moth-eaten nonsense a miss.</Review>
            <Review>There's a terrific sense of menace in this gothic dramatic thriller, which plays on the story's fantasy elements to take us into a teen girl's troubled imagination. It's beautifully shot too.</Review>
            <Review>A redundant teen-horror romp which, in the space of its slender running time, actually begins to make you pine for the return of Bella and Edward.</Review>
            <Review>The lacklustre script is so determined to spell out thoughts and emotions that it becomes insulting.</Review>
            <Review>Like the central character, it's difficult to convince ourselves that this sinister nastiness isn't really happening. So we get increasingly unnerved as the story progresses.</Review>

            <Review>Well-acted schmaltz with some gaping plot holes.</Review>

            <Review>The overheated eroticism could have at least made for a camp classic, but the film's chilling narcissism ultimately makes for a pleasureless fantasy.</Review>
            <Review>How bad is this Zac attack? Well, let's just say I'm convinced director Scott Hicks opted to render his buff-and-scruffy star the strong, silent type just to keep Efron from opening his mouth.</Review>
            <Review>Falling victim to his source material, Hicks fails to invest it with any sort of edge, rendering the cinematic version as mawkish and saccharine as Sparks' bloated prose.</Review>
            <Review>Even within the company of recent Sparks releases like this year's 'The Vow', 'The Lucky One' comes across as a two-dimensional cartoon masquerading as heartfelt human interaction.</Review>

            <Review>If you're after a high-quality weepie, this superbly crafted romantic melodrama from director Scott Hicks (Shine; The Boys Are Back) and novelist Nicholas Sparks (The Notebook; Dear John) will drain your tear ducts.</Review>

            <Review>While it may not stand out from similar movies, Monsieur Lazhar is a sweet film with a simple story and remains engaging thanks in large part to Mohamed Fellag's charming performance.</Review>

            <Review>Some of the shock effects in Lovely Molly are successfully disorienting, but too many of its ideas are reductive and histrionic, such as those concerning the male victimization of women, vengeance and mental illness.</Review>
            <Review>Sanchez ratchets up the tension incrementally - things heard and not quite seen - creating a mood of unease that graduates in stages into full-blown horror.</Review>
            <Review>Sanchez ... is not making his debut here, and after more than a decade he should be willing to do something besides jerking the camera around and making noises offscreen.</Review>
            <Review>Generating suspense without blowing the special-effects budget, Mr. Sanchez paints an intimate portrait of a tormented personality.</Review>
            <Review>Doles out its best ideas and moments with a strong sense of restraint, timing, and impact.</Review>
            <Review>I don't think I've ever been so bummed out by a horror flick as I was by writer-director Eduardo Sánchez's Lovely Molly. And I've seen every single Friday the 13th.</Review>
            <Review>Silly Molly.</Review>
            <Review>Gretchen Lodge constantly rises above the film and the material. She alone provides good reasons why younger film-goers who are inexperienced in this type of horror might well find it gripping, shocking and enjoyably nasty.</Review>
            <Review>Sanchez has not had an easy time since Blair Witch - and this hand-held rerun is unlikely to make it any better.</Review>
            <Review>The film presents us with too many unearned revelations, and it unravels.</Review>

            <Review>"Headhunters" is an absurd amount of grisly fun, which is a good thing, since, looked at in any great detail, it probably doesn't hold up all that well.</Review>
            <Review>By film's end, we're deep into Coen brothers territory, with an extra splash of Sam Raimi-level gore.</Review>
            <Review>"Headhunters" isn't a pretty film, and it doesn't always entirely make sense, but it races along like a man chased by killers.</Review>
            <Review>'Headhunters" is a frighteningly well-made thriller about an amoral art thief on the run.</Review>
            <Review>Like a Teutonic techno band, this thriller is both skillfully familiar and chillingly strange.</Review>
            <Review>"Headhunters" is a bit like an Ikea desk assembled with your nondominant arm -- sleek and attractive, but likely to fall to pieces if you look at it too hard.</Review>
            <Review>One of those all-too-rare movies that puts you through the emotional ringer, playing on your worst fears and most passionate desires.</Review>
            <Review>Headhunters is an intriguing action thriller that relies on both stunts and the acts of its diverse mains characters, played by well-cast main actors Aksel Hennie and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, in order to tell its story.</Review>
            <Review>This film is filled with suspense, violence, duplicity and emotion. The plot has a number of interesting twists. It is a very gritty thriller.</Review>
            <Review>Though not completely satisfying or believable, the absurd cat-and-mouse potboiler at least is always entertaining and biting doggy style.</Review>
            <Review>[A]n insane thriller in which form easily trumps -- while still complementing -- the material's inherent madness.</Review>
            <Review>A hugely enjoyable, unpredictable thriller that never forgets to be fun first and foremost.</Review>

        <StoryLine>The incredible true story of two-time World Heavyweight Boxing Champion Max Schmeling, who rose to fame in the ring before reluctantly serving in the German Air Force during World War II. Back in the 1930, there were few bigger testaments to German might than the fighter known as Black Uhlan of the Rhine. But while the powerful pugilist thrilled fight fanatics across the globe with thrilling bouts against Joe Louis and Max Bear, it was Schmeling's outspoken criticisms of the Nazi party that sent his life spiraling in an unexpected direction. Forced to join the Nazi regime as a direct result of his insubordination, Schmeling found himself a man without a country. Thanks to his bravery in saving two young Jewish girls during World War II, however, sports fans would later discover that Schmeling wasn't just a champion, but a real life hero as well. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>a paean to "First World Problems"</Review>
            <Review>A complacent uncomplicated family drama with simple yet endearing sensitivities.</Review>
            <Review>No doubt this yarn enthralled Larry and Meg Kasdan's dinner guests, but onscreen the crisis seems dull and inconsequential, in part because the quest for the dog is essentially a MacGuffin that drives the blah 'real' story about marital reconciliation.</Review>
            <Review>A couple adopt a dog. Then they lose the dog. Then they try to find the dog. Do they end up finding the dog? Egads, don't let me spoil every twist and turn in this movie!</Review>
            <Review>Featuring beautiful cinematography that captures the natural beauty of the Rockies and a superlative cast, Lawrence and Meg Kasdan's "Darling Companion" is a darling of a film.</Review>

            <Review>Dante Lam is John Woo via Michael Bay; he doesn't want to win you over, he wants to beat you up and make you crazy. And for all its silliness, "The Viral Factor" does just that.</Review>
            <Review>Gunfights and explosions are audaciously played out in real urban locations swarming with people and vehicles, all unfolding with high tension, without losing sight of continuity.</Review>
            <Review>It takes a special kind of action director to use chaotic, human-filled public spaces for high-energy foot chases, auto stunts and gun battles yet never once get under the skin with a sense of genuine danger.</Review>
            <Review>Tediously overwrought and drably made, with scenes punctuated by synthesized drums out of eighties American TV drama.</Review>
            <Review>"The Viral Factor" wants to be both an action movie and a soap opera. But the merging of the two genres by Dante Lam, a director based in Hong Kong, is clumsy, and so is the film.</Review>
            <Review>It's an overloaded, overwrought, profligate production inclined to hysteria and, in cumulative effect, something like being pelted with scenes until buried alive...</Review>
            <Review>If action is all you seek, then I recommend that you watch the movie in 30-minute segments. Start, then stop when you get tired. Then, start again. It might be more palatable that way.</Review>
            <Review>...director Dante Lam...may have created the best action film of 2012.</Review>
            <Review>Stylish, exhilarating action sequences compensate for the corny drama and occasional tedium.</Review>
            <Review>The well crafted set pieces make any plot heaviness go down in smooth, exciting fashion.</Review>
            <Review>Lam has breathtakingly delivered on the film's action promise, even if the drama proves altogether disposable.</Review>
            <Review>A monster rush of muscular action sequences, tepidly glued together with rapidly evaporating logic. Secret agent Man's brain turns to mush, and it spreads to the audience.</Review>

        <StoryLine>An over-zealous cop with a penchant for enforcing the absolute letter of the law, drives an already desperate man over the edge in this melodramatic police drama. The trouble begins when the officer, who has alienated friends, colleagues and even his own mother with his rigid, by-the-book-ways, gets demoted to crossing-guard and ends up stopping an impoverished fellow because the muffler on his old car is bad. Unfortunately, the man is en route to the job he needs to support his crippled daughter and wife. The petty policeman takes so much time writing the ticket that the fellow loses his job. It doesn't take long for the family to become destitute and desperately hungry. With no other recourse, the man takes his WW I medals to a pawnshop. Unfortunately, he and the owner argue and a fight ensues resulting in the man knocking out the proprietor and robbing the store. Later, the man is driving the old car when the cop stops and arrests him for not repairing that muffler. The press learns about the arrest and begins deriding the police department. Things get worse when the police find that the man robbed a store. Meanwhile, the troublesome cop is at a crossing guard when the man's handicapped daughter gets hit by a car. The officer and a teacher take the crumpled girl to her home and it is then he learns the awful truth and must finally face up to the repercussions of his pettiness. Fortunately, this leads him to change for the better, but not before he learns a few more painful lessons.</StoryLine>

        <Duration>80</Duration>
        <StoryLine>FAMILY AFFAIR had its world premiere at the Sundance 2010 Film Festival and became the talk of the festival. Screening to sold out audiences and standing ovations, this riveting film goes deep into family secrets and the need to hold on to family after horrendous things happen. In FAMILY AFFAIR, filmmaker Chico David Colvard takes us on a very personal and uncompromising journey, where we discover that at the age of nine he accidentally shot his sister; believing she would die from her injuries, she revealed to the mother and police that the father had sexually molested her and her sisters for years. Using a verit� approach, this film paints a truer reality of the father-daughter relationship, which our imaginations are often unable to consider, while exploring how pedophilia can manipulate and control an entire family for life.-- (C) C-Line Films</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>The three sons of a reckless, recently-deceased gambler make a shocking discovery that causes them to reassess their lives as they race to make the most of the precious little time they have left. A hard living father of five, Duke White (Harvey Keitel) had a bad habit of gambling away every penny that came his way. Now Duke is dead, and he's got one last surprise for his three oldest sons: years ago, Duke signed up Cal, Jacob, and Nuts for a series of drug tests that drastically reduced their life expectancies. Upon learning that his time on Earth is quickly running out, Cal (Scott Caan) goes after Miranda (Tricia Helfer), the one girl he always regretted letting slip through his fingers. Former boxer Nuts (Jason Jones), meanwhile, decides to step back into the ring to prove that he can still deliver a crowd-pleasing punch. And then there's Jacob (Paulo Costanzo), the son who stopped taking risks after settling into a comfortable career. Now, with his youngest brother Todd (Siam Yu) by his side, Jacob is going to throw caution to the wind, and do all of the things he was too afraid to do before he knew that his days were numbered.</StoryLine>

        <Title>Edwin Boyd (Citizen Gangster)</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2012</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>105</Duration>
        <StoryLine>The first feature from writer/director Nathan Morlando, Citizen Gangster is based on the true story of Edwin Boyd (Scott Speedman), the man who became postwar Toronto's most famous criminal. Edwin Boyd has returned from WWII and is dismayed by public indifference towards veterans and humiliated by his inability to fulfill his dream of being a Hollywood star or provide for his children and wife Doreen (Kelly Reilly). Seeing only disappointment in the face of his policeman father (Brian Cox), Eddie is desperate and starts to rob banks. But what starts as friendly and flirtatious robberies, performed while wearing thick makeup, evolves over time into a career that when mixed with a gang of small time criminals is not unlike that of Clyde Barrow or Butch Cassidy, in which crime and love are mixed to get explosive results. -- (C) IFC</StoryLine>

            <Review>Inspired by Boyd's story, rather than literally retelling it, the movie is less a gangster film than an existential allegory of choices and limitations.</Review>
            <Review>Morlando has crafted a stylishly shot and evocatively designed period piece. But it's the dashing, quietly charismatic Speedman who proves the main draw, holding our attention even when the movie doesn't.</Review>
            <Review>Morlando has chosen to approach this material not with witty cynicism, but with quiet, and at times leaden, sincerity.</Review>
            <Review>A good-looking but passionless affair that remains stubbornly aloof from its audience.</Review>
            <Review>Citizen Gangster hits its marks when it's exploding the character's larger-than-life status, aided in large part by Speedman's career-best turn.</Review>
            <Review>As good as Citizen Gangster is, it would be even better if you could understand the dialogue.</Review>
            <Review>"Citizen Gangster" is not exactly riveting. Speedman does the best he can in the title role. He gives his character life even as the sub par script drags us along.</Review>
            <Review>The true moments of tension and danger in this film sing, and some moments, big and small, will haunt the viewer.</Review>
            <Review>With no firm hand guiding the proceedings, this potentially interesting slice of Canadian history winds up feeling like just another "Crime Doesn't Pay" PS</Review>
            <Review>How could the tale of Toronto's most flamboyant bank robber be turned into such a blah, seen-it-all-before film?</Review>
            <Review>[VIDEO] Everything about "Citizen Gangster" seems second-rate.</Review>
            <Review>Its commentary on our fascination with law-breakers is virtually nonexistent, except to the extent that the film itself revels in the doomed romanticism of its own protagonist.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Two inspiring stories of self-discovery intertwine over a day in mystical Sedona. One follows successful advertising executive Tammy on her birthday as she drives from Portland to Phoenix to land the biggest client of her career. A wrong turn gets her lost and takes her into Sedona by mistake, where a local tour plane runs her off the highway right in the middle of town during an emergency crash landing. She's forced to wait in Sedona while her damaged car is repaired. Across town, uptight lawyer Scott, vacationing with his partner Eddie and their two young sons, embarks on a family day hike out in the forest among the majestic red rocks. Eddie has brought workaholic Scott to Sedona for some rest and relaxation. They wind up in an unexpected frightening adventure out on the hiking trails when their 7-year-old Denny gets lost. The ensuing frantic search for the little boy sends Scott into a profound life-changing journey that forces him to examine his priorities and determine what's truly important in life. Meanwhile, Tammy unwittingly begins a spiritual transformation of her own as she encounters an array of quirky locals, each touching her in different meaningful ways. A string of bizarre coincidences spirals her out of control, leaving her haunted by her past and forcing her to face her demons head on. Letting her guard down, she confronts the implausible possibility that she has been brought to Sedona for a greater purpose.</StoryLine>

            <Review>A tactile, emotion-laden world of beauty, loss, recovery.</Review>
            <Review>In "Hide Away," Josh Lucas plays an alcoholic widower who undergoes a spiritual rebirth by fixing up a sailboat, and I really wish he hadn't.</Review>
            <Review>[It] feels padded even in its brief running time; it's a slight mood piece posing as a character study.</Review>
            <Review>Elliot Davis's pretty greeting-card cinematography, which lingers on birds, clouds and branches as it follows the seasonal changes, is better at evoking the passage of time and the rhythms of nature than all the sodden, pretentious dialogue.</Review>
            <Review>It's basically just Lucas going through a short story-like period of reflection and redemption almost entirely without dialogue. It's not enough, but it is what this underappreciated actor does best.</Review>
            <Review>The film stays afloat, if barely, thanks to Elliot Davis's uncluttered camerawork, a surprisingly unsentimental denouement, and performers who deftly undersell the script's corniest pretensions.</Review>
            <Review>Beautifully shot, elegantly acted melodrama of the sailboating cure for what ails you.</Review>
            <Review>Josh Lucas drinks, bats his watery eyes and stares into space for nearly 90 minutes in Hide Away. And yet somehow the actor overshadows the obvious life lessons that threaten to sink the project at every turn.</Review>
            <Review>Beautifully-shot, but undercooked and too heavy on metaphors. Josh Lucas elevates the film with a strong, well-nuanced performance.</Review>
            <Review>Hide Away has more clunky moments than it does elegantly minimalist ones, the worst of which is the glimpse of what actually happened to the man's family.</Review>
            <Review>Eyre has moved far from the Native setting of his breakthrough film Smoke Signals; the stillness at the center here owes more to classic Japanese cinema.</Review>
            <Review>A man-versus-nature parable heavy on the sappy existentialism that's very much of our time. Call it Nicholas Sparks's The Grey.</Review>

            <Review>Weekend, which was shot with watery beauty on location in Nottingham in the U.K., also owes something to Before Sunrise, but it's not a gay remake of a straight movie. Its romance is very deliberately not some reworked version of a hetero one.</Review>
            <Review>Sexy, provocative, engrossing and occasionally ornery, it should appeal to anyone whose curiosity about someone new has provoked them to question their own identity.</Review>
            <Review>Cullen and New are British stage actors with little background in film. Haigh's only previous film was a documentary. Perhaps because they don't feel bound by a set of rules, they've created one of the year's most enjoyable surprises.</Review>
            <Review>It's a definitive example of naturalistic moviemaking -- you feel you're breathing the air that the characters are breathing.</Review>
            <Review>Its final moments offer a vision of what a contemporary romance can achieve: an appreciative gasp of truth, a wet-eyed hope for more.</Review>
            <Review>One of the truest, most beautiful movies ever made about two strangers.</Review>
            <Review>However, to simply call it 'a gay movie' would commit it a great disservice as the fragmented kaleidoscope of fleeting romantic pains and pleasures should resonate with gay and straight audiences in equal measure.</Review>
            <Review>A romance that finds intimacy in intense conversation but also a very British film about private and public spaces; a potent mix of the sensually intimate and the politically confrontational.</Review>
            <Review>For a movie that bares the souls of its characters so completely, Weekend doesn't unfold like a complicated movie. The dialogue is natural, the sex scenes are tender, and the camera never gets in the way of the story.</Review>
            <Review>Probably one of the greatest films ever made on the subject of gay love, not because it deals with issues of homosexuality, but because it simply tells a tender, honest, emotionally potent love story.</Review>
            <Review>Weekend works beautifully in the moment, and lingers long after an initial viewing. It's certainly an affair to remember.</Review>
            <Review>Weekend has romance to spare, but also takes a look at the cogs turning under the surface of any thoughtful encounter, however brief.</Review>

            <Review>Dynamically shot and paced like a thriller, the film has the density and moral prickliness of a good novel.</Review>
            <Review>These people seem so real they might live next door. And they probably do.</Review>
            <Review>"A Separation" is a plaintive fable of the human condition that unites us.</Review>
            <Review>Very few movies capture as convincingly as A Separation does the ways in which seemingly honorable decisions can lead to interpersonal conflict -- even disaster.</Review>
            <Review>To say the piercing Iranian film A Separation is about divorce is a bit like saying The Wizard of Oz is about a pair of slippers.</Review>
            <Review>It's ferociously wise, gripping, unsettling and acted with unerring conviction.</Review>
            <Review>As pure entertainment, "A Separation" is flawless. But as social commentary, one could infer a conservative agenda.</Review>
            <Review>Ambiguous endings can work for some films, but it doesn't here. Still, the powerful performances and near seamless screenplay leave little else to be desired. A Separation deserves its Oscar.</Review>
            <Review>A case study in how simplicity can produce spectacular results that extend far beyond a film's budget.</Review>
            <Review>[A] flawless domestic portrait.</Review>
            <Review>Shot with the intensity of a thriller, the film shows how sometimes even the most well-intentioned decisions can have terrible and tragically unforeseen consequences, and it gives a human face to a populace we do not truly know.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Julio is a struggling young writer who has hit a wall. Unemployed and involved in a half-hearted relationship with his neighbor, things are finally starting to look up when he gets an interview with a renowned author to transcribe his latest work. Things don't go as planned, however, and Julio doesn't get the job. Instead of admitting the truth to his girlfriend, he pretends to be transcribing the novel when actually writing his own story. Searching for inspiration and a plot, Julio revisits a romance he had eight years ago when studying literature in Valdivia. As Julio's novel progresses, so does his fondness for the past and of the love he let slip away. Based on an internationally acclaimed novella, Bons�i is a subtly affecting examination of the lies we tell ourselves in order to get by. -- (C) Strand</StoryLine>

            <Review>The problem is that, unlike Ali G, Borat, and Brüno, Aladeen is less a force of nature than a scripted performance.</Review>
            <Review>The film has a vicious edge that the Marx Brothers didn't have, and it's too low-minded to achieve their enchanting blend of anarchy and surrealism.</Review>
            <Review>Now [Cohen is] turning material both fresh and rancid into tepid gruel.</Review>
            <Review>On the laughmeter The Dictator is closer to Borat than to the misfired Bruno, which is to say it's funny for about half of its brisk 83 minutes.</Review>
            <Review>Most of The Dictator had me neither laughing nor shocked, but just staring at the screen in anxious is-that-all-there-is? silence.</Review>
            <Review>A bit scattershot and schticky, the film never quite settles into a consistent comic rhythm. Yet for fans of Baron Cohen's work there are plenty of moments of crass hilarity.</Review>
            <Review>Feels more like one of those lousy SNL movies from the early nineties than the work of our sharpest contemporary satirist.</Review>
            <Review>This comedy succeeds as a crude, inventive and humours look at a dumb despot.</Review>

Their well wisher, Shastri Chacha, advises and convinces them to migrate to his village Ranakpur where he assures Abbas that he will get him a job at his owner's place. The owner being none other than the powerful Prithviraj Raghuvanshi. Abbas enters Ranakpur village and while saving a child trapped inside a temple, he breaks open the lock of an ancestral temple but fate plays an important twist in Abbas' life as the whole village including Prithviraj's step-brother Vikrant opposes Abbas' actions but Prithviraj arrives and handles the situation. On being asked his name, Abbas's friend comes out with a fake name, as it would create a rage if villagers came to know that the lock of a temple had been broken by a Muslim. From here starts a series of cover-ups, goof-ups and comic situations where to cover one lie, Abbas starts padding up with a bigger lie telling people that he also has a twin brother with no moustache. From here on starts the topsy-turvy journey of a single person acting as two different entities.</StoryLine>

            <Review>This big-budget summer release starts off awkwardly with a half-hearted music number, but once it kicks into gear, the film's engaging performances and ever-spiraling hysteria make its two-and-a-half-hour running time fly by.</Review>
            <Review>Bol Bachchan carries off its rapidly thinning, virtually villain-free plot thanks to its fast-paced presentation of a storyline that hinges on a succession of double identities and escalating fabrications.</Review>
            <Review>Though Shetty's movie love is noticeable, his reliance on frantic sound effects and empty action-comedy set pieces over well-thought-out farce mechanics is ultimately wearying.</Review>
            <Review>It feels over-familiar, worthy of only the occasional grin.</Review>
            <Review>The energy, the performances, the comedy, the story rhythms, production and styling, and the sheer manic craziness takes hold from the get-go and does not let up over its nearly three-hour running time.</Review>

        <Duration>85</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Margaret Atwood's visionary work Payback: Debt and the Shadow Side of Wealth is the basis for this riveting and poetic documentary on "debt" in its various forms-societal, personal, environmental, spiritual, criminal, and of course, economic. Filmmaker Jennifer Baichwal strikingly interweaves these (sometimes surprising) debtor/creditor relationships: two families in a years-long Albanian blood feud; the BP oil spill vs. the Earth; mistreated Florida tomato farm workers and their bosses; imprisoned media mogul Conrad Black and the U.S. justice system. With stunning cinematography and insightful commentary from renowned thinkers Raj Patel, Louise Arbour and Atwood herself, Payback is a brilliant, game-changing rumination on the subject -- (C) Zeitgeist</StoryLine>

            <Review>There's a splendid audacity in Baichwal trying to bring to the screen something as idea-driven as Atwood's book.</Review>
            <Review>Baichwal could have devoted a single film to just BP's disgraceful behavior.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately, this intriguing but scattershot movie turns on the incompatibility of two worldviews - the corporate-financial vs. the environmental-spiritual.</Review>
            <Review>Adapting non-fiction to cinema can be tricky even for a documentarian, but Jennifer Baichwal makes a game effort at turning Margaret Atwood's book-length essay Payback: Debt And The Shadow Side Of Wealth into a movie.</Review>
            <Review>Despite trying to fit both the ancient Albanian Kanun legal code and the fate of the environment on the same procrustean bed, Baichwal's free-flowing essay film stands as a thoughtful and compelling meditation on global interconnectivity...</Review>
            <Review>You can't help feeling that the movie owed its subject - and its audience - a bit more.</Review>
            <Review>Brings to life serious discussions of philosophical issues through impassioned case studies [but] works too hard for an upbeat ending.</Review>
            <Review>An earnest and edifying documentary on the philosophical and ethical ramifications of debt as something owed.</Review>
            <Review>Makes similar points as several other docs, but in a more labored and tedious way.</Review>
            <Review>Three real-life horror stories are linked by the theme of debt in this informative but sometimes wandering doc.</Review>
            <Review>This doc on the many forms of human debt, though often frustratingly broad, offers a path to balancing civilization's ledger with a hard-nosed brand of altruism.</Review>
            <Review>Cinematic globe-trotting doesn't necessarily trump reading a good book, it turns out; then again, more movies should be burdened with the flaw of being too intellectually curious.</Review>

            <Review>"Bernie' isn't a monumental film, but it is a finely tuned character study with some nice innovations.</Review>
            <Review>The question of why the law must always be upheld, regardless of consequences, gives this light, amiable movie a surprising heft and weight.</Review>
            <Review>Bernie has chuckles, but it's hardly riotous. And this is a good thing.</Review>
            <Review>Propelled by a perfectly cast trio of stars whose eccentricities shine in singular character roles, Bernie is charmer.</Review>
            <Review>Black is terrific. Rather than winking at the audience, he plays Bernie as a guy who's thoroughly unaware that there's anything unconventional about his behavior.</Review>
            <Review>"Bernie" unfolds into many equally rich narrative strands: love story, southern Gothic slice-of-life and, finally tragedy and legal thriller...</Review>
            <Review>In what appears to be a possible first career dud, 'Bernie,' billed as a dark comedy starring Jack Black, falls far short of Linklater's normal standard.</Review>
            <Review>Actual scenes with Black, MacLaine and McConaughey start to feel like over-acted interruptions to the documentary we'd rather be watching.</Review>
            <Review>But the troubling question at the heart of this liberating, sunlit, deceptively simple but extremely complex and fairly formidable film is: should the law or the community itself decide the fate of its citizens?</Review>
            <Review>It manages to feel unique and different ... It's funny too, which certainly helps, and is benefited immensely by a wonderful cast of big names and unknowns that help make this Linklater's freshest film in quite some time.</Review>
            <Review>a well-rounded dramatic film taken from a refreshingly uplifting perspective.</Review>
            <Review>It looks like a southern gothic and feels like a particularly hilarious farce, but Bernie is not at all what you think.</Review>

            <Review>Of course, if you're a fan of old-school Disney True-Life Adventure tales like "Joker: The Amiable Ocelot," then you're used to this sort of sanitizing of the world's rougher edges.</Review>
            <Review>Walt Disney himself couldn't have scripted "Chimpanzee" any better.</Review>
            <Review>Resurrects some of the worst traits of the studio's True-Life Adventures series of the 1950s, '60s and '70s, dubiously shaping some amazing footage with cornball narration that relentlessly anthropomorphizes its simian subjects.</Review>
            <Review>It's really a wonder of nature, a reminder of how we are bound to other species and how valuable and special and downright magical their lives are. It may be a bit corny at times, but it's also downright enlightening.</Review>
            <Review>One wonders whether more than a few viewers won't want to take home a baby chimp after seeing the film.</Review>
            <Review>It's beautifully photographed, whimsically narrated by Tim Allen and keeps completely schtum about the rough sex and the cannibalism.</Review>
            <Review>As a primate primer for the younger end of the family market, Chimpanzee does a good job of inspiring awe in our closest cousins and doesn't stint on harsh "circle of life" lessons ...</Review>
            <Review>The presentation makes one wince, and the most striking footage is some behind-the-scenes shots that accompany the credits.</Review>
            <Review>Chimpanzees share 96 per cent of our DNA and a common Pan Prior ancestry. We'll bet they're embarrassed to admit as much when they see this.</Review>
            <Review>With no sign of Tarzan there's little genuine drama in Chimpanzee and this film probably won't save any rainforests, but it's heartfelt, beautifully shot and you'll never use a nutcracker without thinking of little Oscar.</Review>

Much to his surprise, Carey finds that his "deceased" lover is not only still alive, but also the wife of a powerful Italian nobleman (Francis Lederer). He also discovers to his sorrow that the far-from-grateful Italian villagers hold the Americans responsible for their current financial travails. Still, Carey sticks around, hoping to flush out the traitor who'd caused the wartime deaths of several of his OSS colleagues. The box-office success of Captain Carey USA was enhanced by the incidental musical number "Mona Lisa," which subsequently won an Academy Award.</StoryLine>

        <ReleaseDate> 2009</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>95</Duration>
        <StoryLine>A damaged family struggles to come to terms with their need for love in this comedy-drama from Canadian writer and director Adriana Maggs. Ray (Shawn Doyle) was a local hero in the small Newfoundland town where he grew up when he earned a spot on a major league hockey team, but after playing just one game he was busted for drugs, and after a stretch behind bars he returned home to an unglamorous career as a small time marijuana dealer. Ray is married to Lillian (Sherry White) and they have two daughters, Ruby (Tatiana Maslany) and Rose (Julia Kennedy), but when Lillian leaves her family behind to go to Hollywood in search of stardom, everyone looks for a way to keep the family together. Ray dates nearly every eligible woman in town in hopes of finding a new mother for his daughters, but despite outward appearances he's deep in denial about the fact he's gay. At the age of 13, Ruby is also confused about her sexuality; she's pretty enough to attract the attention of the boys at her school, and finds that dressing and acting like a flirt will get her the attention she craves. But when she asks her handicapped friend Stuart (Jonny Harris) to take some pictures she can send to movie producers in hopes of joining her mother in Hollywood, he encourages her to pose for some compromising shots that fall into the wrong hands. Grown Up Movie Star was an official selection at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival, where Tatiana Maslany received a special jury prize for her breakout performance in the film.</StoryLine>

            <Review>It isn't a polished effort, but Maggs delivers a watchable movie thanks to snappy dialogue (also provided by Maggs) and outstanding work from a cast plucked mostly from The Rock.</Review>
            <Review>Grown Up Movie Star is unruly, tortured, crisis-prone, nervy, melodramatic and just charming enough to make you forgive all of the above. It's like a teenager that way.</Review>

            <Review>Like the select participants of its savage sport, The Hunger Games stands triumphant, if scarred and a bit wobbly from the contest.</Review>
            <Review>It features a functioning creative imagination and lots of honest-to-goodness acting by its star, Jennifer Lawrence, who brings her usual toughness and emotional transparency to the archer-heroine Katniss.</Review>
            <Review>Watching The Hunger Games, I was struck both by how slickly Ross hit his marks and how many opportunities he was missing to take the film to the next level -- to make it more shocking, lyrical, crazy, daring.</Review>
            <Review>It adds up to an intelligent, reasonably well-made first installment that leaves us primed for Katniss' future adventures.</Review>
            <Review>A refreshingly gritty and adventurous affair that packs plenty of thematic depth, it doesn't let the ambitious source material down.</Review>
            <Review>Has all the technical ingredients of a great (and even important) film, but sideswipes them in order to leave the audience feeling like that they have been abandoned in the wilderness of extreme cruelty.</Review>
            <Review>Though not at all innovative or original, is at least a worthwhile action fantasy.</Review>
            <Review>Director Gary Ross does a great job in bringing the thrilling novel to life in this uncompromising drama.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is oddly blithe about its central premise. How can this movie set up this monstrous society and this brutal game of genocide and expect us to not only cheer for someone to "win," but also hope she finds someone to kiss in the end?</Review>

            <Review>My only complaint about The Raid is that it ended.</Review>
            <Review>For now, count 'The Raid' alongside the likes of Peter Jackson's 'Bad Taste' or Guillermo del Toro's 'Mimic': a talented young filmmaker flexing his muscles, stating his intent, and promising better things in the future.</Review>
            <Review>The movie gets a little slow when it settles down for some routine dialogue or plot development, but it's never more than a couple minutes before break time is over and it's back to the insane fighting stunts.</Review>
            <Review>"The Raid: Redemption" is built on shaky and blood-soaked ground, but if towering technique is all you want from an action movie, then yippee-ki-yay.</Review>
            <Review>Evans doesn't bother much with story or character development, instead making his film a kind of brutal ballet.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is a gory free-for-all, a horror film dressed up as an action film, and it's as pure a shot of adrenaline as any Tarantino fan could wish for.</Review>
            <Review>The Raid thrives on a passion for extreme cinema that is rooted more in the universal taste for blood and butchery.</Review>
            <Review>A triumph of fight choreography, spatial relations and precious little else.</Review>
            <Review>Hollywood is particularly unsuited to producing sensation cinema these days.</Review>
            <Review>You really have an obligation to see it to witness what has a legitimate claim of being the best action film of all time.</Review>
            <Review>Gareth Huw Evans doesn't swipe plot points as much as organically build a taut, expertly choreographed heir to urban mayhem fantasies</Review>
            <Review>Action so relentless, the stuntmen probably asked for stuntmen.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Juan is 40 years old, most of which he spent in Cuba doing absolutely nothing. Juan's only emotional tie is his daughter, Camila, a beautiful young girl that doesn't want anything to do with her father because the only thing he's good at is getting into trouble. Suddenly some strange things start to happen, people are turning violent attacking one to the other. Juan was first convinced it's just another stage of the Revolution. Little by little Juan and his friends start to realize that the attackers are not normal human beings and that killing them is quite a difficult task. They're not vampires, they're not possesed, but they're definitely not dissidents; a simple bite turns the victim into other violent killing machine and the only way to beat them is destroying their brains. Juan decides that the best way of facing the situation is making some money out of it..... -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>The 'Evil Dead' and Romero nods are fun, but characters appear for no reason and are bumped off without warning; there's just not enough flesh on these funny bones.</Review>
            <Review>As a zombie picture, Juan of the Dead is merely OK. But as a satirical comedy of life in Cuba under Castro, it totally kills - and keeps coming back for more.</Review>
            <Review>A silly and occasionally creepy zombie movie, but one that also dares to have a brain...</Review>
            <Review>Not only is this movie funnier than "Shawn of the Dead", its obvious inspiration, it is proof that Cuba is not a totalitarian dungeon.</Review>
            <Review>Sure, some of the socialist humor and Cuban culture may be lost on American viewers, but the film is still a ton of fun.</Review>
            <Review>This zombie revolucion takes aim at our funny bone and the damage done by the Castro regime.</Review>
            <Review>The story is a bit choppy from the middle to the end. But, hardcore zombie fans can be very forgiving. And, for them, "Juan of the Dead" might just be worth the time. The ending is clever and upbeat. Not too bad.</Review>
            <Review>A very broad and exceedingly splattery mash-up of horror, comedy, and mild social commentary.</Review>
            <Review>A little too slight to fill out a feature-length run time, yet it's spunky enough to entertain and occasionally horrify, though it's not always the zombies that induce the most revulsion.</Review>
            <Review>Most strikingly, Juan of the Dead understands its unique situation as a Cuban genre film, and its political awareness gives texture to the gags.</Review>
            <Review>A familiar horror spoof that rather overstays its welcome.</Review>

        <Duration>91</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Lorna (Gina Gershon, SHOWGIRLS, P.S. I LOVE YOU) is a strong-willed Texas woman who's had enough of her untrustworthy husband Dale's (Val Kilmer, TOP GUN, BATMAN FOREVER) criminal acts and lack of husbandry. Fed up, she enlists the help of her old friend, Tiny (Kelli Giddish, NBC's "Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit"), to help her figure out what to do with Dale after his latest double-cross involving the theft of $100,000 from a bank. As the girls brainstorm for a "neat" solution, they medicate themselves with only the best of prescriptions - Tennessee whiskey - which leads them to even bigger problems. When Sheriff Cooley (Ray Liotta, GOODFELLAS, HANNIBAL) inconveniently enters the conundrum, the story evolves into a tale of revenge and survival that resolves in true Texas fashion: bold and ruthless.</StoryLine>

            <Review>No kidding. If you chained-smoked half as much as the plotting ladies in this twisty dramedy, you'd be hyperventilating, too.</Review>
            <Review>Could be watchable because of Gina Gershon's mildly interesting manipulative and ruthless damsel-in-distress role.</Review>
            <Review>Now Val Kilmer is just in a race with Ray Liotta to see who can get the oldest and the fattest the fastest. It's like the tagline to "Alien Vs Predator;" whoever wins...we lose.</Review>

        <Duration>82</Duration>
        <StoryLine>The anger and outrage captured by graphic artists have defined revolutions through the centuries. Printmakers have depicted the human condition in all its glories and struggles so powerfully that perceptions, attitudes and politics have been dramatically influenced. And the value and impact of this art is even more important today. In the new documentary, Art Is... The Permanent Revolution, three contemporary American artists and a master printer help explain the dynamic sequences of social reality and protest. Among the wide range of 60 artists on display are Rembrandt, Goya, Daumier, Kollwitz, Dix, Masereel, Grosz, Gropper, and Picasso. While their stirring graphics sweep by, the making of an etching, a woodcut and a lithograph unfolds before our eyes, as the contemporary artists join their illustrious predecessors in creating art of social engagement. -- (C) First Run</StoryLine>

            <Review>I did not know this film was based on a true story until the closing credits, which makes this story so much more terrifying. Director Justin Kurzel crafted a raw feel that will leave you slack-jawed.</Review>
            <Review>Unflinchingly nasty, graphic and gut-wrenchingly powerful, Snowtown is a film that dares you to look away, but compels you to keep watching. As portraits of serial killers go, this deserves to be hung on the wall next to Henry.</Review>
            <Review>The grimy social realism and gurgling torture scenes place director Justin Kurzel's startling debut midway between Animal Kingdom and Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer.</Review>
            <Review>It has no particular observations about the mind of psychopaths that is worth the incredibly nasty feeling you get from sitting through its incredibly grim two hours.</Review>
            <Review>Is it the Aussie Gummo, or a true-crime drama that takes itself way too seriously? Can it be both simultaneously?</Review>
            <Review>Observing the character's regular and repeated acts of cruelty becomes numbing after awhile.</Review>

        <Duration>109</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Been looking all your life for a sizzling mash-up of Paris Is Burning, Rent and Dreamgirls? Leave It On the Floor is that and more, a supersized musical featuring a family of fierce voguing performers coming together to snatch a trophy in the big ballroom competition. When our hero Brad is kicked out of his house for being gay, he finds himself drawn into a raucous ballroom event. Looking for a warm place to sleep-and someone to sleep with?-Brad meets the ragtag members of the struggling House of Eminence. As he searches for his place in this family of fascinating characters, he gets schooled in how to express himself with spins, dips, and hands. When he decides to join the house and compete with his new family, everyone comes together to help him learn. That is, until a love triangle threatens to destroy all that they've built together. Director Sheldon Larry deftly interweaves original songs throughout. "Justin's Gonna Call" and the title track "Leave It On the Floor" are sure to make it onto your playlist, and they're all equally matched by the signature moves of Frank Gatson, Jr., one of pop music's most sought-after choreographers (Michael Jackson, Destiny's Child, and does anyone remember an obscure song and dance called "Single Ladies"?). Pulsing with energy, joy, and some of the catchiest and queerest dance songs ever, Leave It On the Floor will keep you coming back for more. - CINDY M. EMCH</StoryLine>

        <ReleaseDate> 1953</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>70</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Big Leaguer was the inauspicious feature-film debut for director Robert Aldrich. Edward G. Robinson stars as the real-life Hans Lobert, the baseball scout in charge of the New York Giants' Florida training camp. Each year, a new crop of would-be ballplayers are given a two-week tryout under Lobert's supervision. The aspirants this time out include, Adam Polachuk (Jeff Richards), the son of a Polish immigrant who wants Adam to become a lawyer; Julie Davis (William Campbell), a tough guy from the streets of New York; Bobby Bronson (Richard Jaeckel), a cocky Ohio lad; and Chuy Aguilar (Lalo Rios), a Mexican youth whose skill on the ballfield compensates for his tenuous grasp of the English language. Gradually, Adam emerges as the film's central character, as he simultaneously tries to make good for Lobert, romance Lobert's niece Christy (Vera-Ellen), and keep his dad from finding out that he's not attending law school. Though Big Leaguer was held in such low esteem by distributor MGM that it became the first Edward G. Robinson picture not to be given a regular playdate in Manhattan, the film is worth seeing today, if only for the presence of such genuine big leaguers as Al Campanis, Carl Hubbell, Bob Trocolor and Tony Ravish.</StoryLine>

            <Review>The new film, despite the astounding story it tells, is the most conventional, least urgent and, cinematically, the least interesting of the three.</Review>
            <Review>In the shadow of such sickness, all the personal dramas can't help but pale, but there are still surprising and powerful moments.</Review>
            <Review>Paradise Lost 3 is perhaps the most interesting and well-made film of the trilogy.</Review>
            <Review>The new film is more informational than resonant. But you can still sense a vacuum, a rat pit of stories waiting to be unearthed. The dark something that triggered the whole ordeal in West Memphis is still out there.</Review>
            <Review>First and foremost a testament to the power of the documentary.</Review>
            <Review>Destined to rank as one of the major achievements in American documentary, the Paradise Lost project comes to a presumed end with Paradise Lost 3: Purgatory.</Review>
            <Review>Seldom has a film inspired so much dislike in viewers towards the very system designed to protect them.</Review>
            <Review>Purgatory is most affecting in its most intimate performances.</Review>
            <Review>Beyond being an articulate examination of the case, the conclusion of the film will leave you with all kinds of questions to ponder about what justice in our legal system really means.</Review>
            <Review>This third film, an inarguably powerful knockout punch, reminds us of the documentary film's power to change people's lives.</Review>
            <Review>Tells us clearly something is rotten about the American judicial system.</Review>
            <Review>As the title implies, this was meant to be a stop-gap, showing a situation which was stuck between two worlds. However, the story has moved beyond that now and we want to know more.</Review>

        <Duration>80</Duration>
        <StoryLine>A devoted California pastor leads the fight to save a struggling Atlanta church from foreclosure in this inspirational religious drama. James White (David A.R. White) was just another associate pastor at the California mega church of Johnny Kingman (Ray Wise) - a television evangelist who presides over a lucrative Christian empire - when he received the opportunity to preside over his own congregation. The only problem? That congregation just so happens to be at the Divine Faith Apostolic Church in Atlanta - a far cry from sunny California. James' family isn't thrilled about the move, and upon arriving at the impoverished church it's obvious that his new parish doesn't exactly welcome him with open arms. But when a greedy banker hatches a plan to foreclose on the house of worship, James and his flock band together with BeBe Winans to stage a musical benefit that just might bring everyone together, and save their church in the process. Victoria Jackson, Jack�e, and Bruce Davison co-star.</StoryLine>

        <ReleaseDate> 1933</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>75</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Hard to Handle stars James Cagney as a fast-talking promoter who pounces upon every current fad and foible to make a quick buck. He promotes marathon dances (where spectators feel cheated because no one drops dead), crash diets, reducing creams and treasure contests, finagling his way into the confidence of high rollers and money men. In a cute "inside" joke harking back to a choice Cagney moment in The Public Enemy, our hero at one point takes up the promotion of grapefruits! Like most conners, Cagney isn't aware when he is being conned himself, and he falls victim to his marathon-dance business partner, who absconds with the winnings. The contest winner is pretty Mary Brian, whose mother (Ruth Donnelly) tries to extract payment by forcing Cagney to marry her daughter. He does, but only after eight reels of high-pressure wheeling and dealing. In the tradition of Jimmy Cagney's other early-1930s, Hard to Handle is socked over by the energetic insouciance of its star.</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>Wei Te-sheng's epic film Warriors of the Rainbow: Seediq Bale reclaims an extraordinary episode from 20thcentury history which is little-known, even in Taiwan. Between 1895 and 1945, the island was a Japanese colony inhabited not only by the majority (Han Chinese Immigrants) but also by the remnants of the aboriginal tribes who first settled the mountainous land. In 1930 Mouna Rudo, the leader of the Seediq tribe settled on and around Mount Chilai, forged a coalition with other Seediq tribal leaders and plotted a rebellion against their Japanese colonial masters. The initial uprising took the Japanese by surprise and was almost entirely successful. But the Japanese soon sent in their army to crush the rebellion, using aircraft and poison gas. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>An ambitious, blood-soaked retelling of an uprising by Taiwanese natives against Japanese occupiers.</Review>
            <Review>At 2 1/2 hours, "Warriors" is a bruising, relentless experience, one more tiring than inspiring.</Review>
            <Review>At two and a half hours, Warriors Of The Rainbow has the shape of something weightier than the simplified good-vs.-evil movie it actually is.</Review>
            <Review>Bruising, brutal tale of rebellion in early 20th Century Taiwan suffers from overkill.</Review>
            <Review>The Taiwanese epic doesn't shy away from anything even though the message is pretty hopeless. But all of the film's depth seems to have been stripped away.</Review>
            <Review>The film includes some stunning visuals, including a few terrific jungle battle scenes.</Review>

            <Review>Marley is highly watchable, finely crafted legacy preservation - and it's either a white-washed sham or awesomely shaded.</Review>
            <Review>It wants to show us the man behind the famous dreads, beatific smile and durable songs of love, hope and longing. In this task it succeeds admirably.</Review>
            <Review>Sprinkled with riffs, concert footage and home videos, the family-authorized documentary does what the artist usually did: When in doubt, return to the beat.</Review>
            <Review>Macdonald supplies some interesting and novel details about the musician's life and art, though the movie's narrative arc and documentary methods are totally predictable.</Review>
            <Review>Given the legal and logistical constraints on this long-delayed project, this lengthy movie is as comprehensive a history as Marley's fans could have hoped, but the uninitiated may not catch a fire.</Review>
            <Review>Bob Marley wrote the same song about 8,000 times, and the documentary "Marley" makes sure to include each version.</Review>
            <Review>Although Marley's immense talent, drive, charisma, marketing savvy, and complexity are too big for any film or book to capture, here, at least, they emerge in vibrant glory.</Review>
            <Review>Comprehensive docu on iconic reggae musician.</Review>
            <Review>Serve[s] its many audiences, doing so without succumbing to faults that so easily could have plagued the film. Well crafted, with a soundtrack that's drawn from the astounding career of its subject, MARLEY joins the pantheon of top-notch music films.</Review>
            <Review>Concert footage includes some of Bob Marley's best-known songs, "Get Up, Stand Up," "I Shot the Sheriff," "No Woman, No Cry," "One Love" and many others. Interviews with people who knew Marley at different times of his life provide a lot of color.</Review>
            <Review>So far, the definitive biopic documentary on the elusive Bob Marley.</Review>
            <Review>Viewers will walk away knowing Bob Marley in much more intimate and accurate fashion, rather than the specious, superficial or incomplete picture they may have had before.</Review>

            <Review>An uncommon thoughtfulness about spiritual issues distinguishes this otherwise generic coming-of-age story.</Review>
            <Review>"Blue Like Jazz" is a pleasant film, as well-intentioned as the character Don himself, but it ducks the thorniest questions of faith and dogma while patting itself on the back for realism.</Review>
            <Review>It is - somewhat surprisingly, given the heavy-handed subject - neither sanctimonious nor preachy.</Review>
            <Review>It tackles existential struggles that many of us grapple with - and the film industry virtually ignores - while doing so in an entertaining way.</Review>
            <Review>Sodom and Gomorrah are paradoxically brought back to life in the form of an Oregon-based liberal-arts college in this Christian recruiting video.</Review>
            <Review>Blue Like Jazz certainly breaks the mould in terms what audiences have come to expect from spiritual cinema, but it refuses to take the necessary leap required to fully redefine mainstream audiences' perception of this niche genre.</Review>
            <Review>A hot mess that somehow manages to somewhat redeem itself by the final frame but sadly not enough to save it from ultimate damnation.</Review>
            <Review>reveals the shallowness of the college years in which an otherwise legal adult can act like a child well into his 20s</Review>
            <Review>[It] playfully serves up more food for thought than most comedies we've seen so far this decade.</Review>
            <Review>Unlike other 'faith-based' films, it lacks a down-on-your-knees come-to-Jesus moment, presenting its young hero as a conflicted Everyman with the same questions about 'the human dilemma' as any sensitive college freshman.</Review>

Cyrus DeBarge (Tyler James Williams) is a talented young lyricist who should be up on the stage instead of bussing tables. But his father (Courtney B. Vance) fals to see the value in hip-hop, and without the confidence to face the crowd, Cyrus' talent will never truly shine. When Cyrus and his best friend Kris (Trevor Jackson) learn that their old friend Roxie (Coco Jones) is sponsoring a major songwriting contest, Cyrus dubs himself "Truth" and filters his feelings for Roxie into a rhyme that takes the top prize. But there's a catch; Kris has been credited as the lyricist, and to make matters worse, smitten Roxie is none the wiser. Later, as the girl he loves starts to slip away and Kris refuses to give up the charade, Cyrus realizes that the time has come to stand up, let the truth be known, and take his one shot at stardom.</StoryLine>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>The effect is stunningly effective, submerging us in a snowy, frozen, barren land with few options but plenty of opportunities for trouble. It is an offbeat gem.</Review>
            <Review>An authentic look at life in remote Alaska (the film was shot with a native cast in MacLean's hometown of Barrow) and at a people grappling with drugs, alcoholism, poverty and the limits of an unforgiving environment.</Review>
            <Review>If only because of the setting, this is an uncommonly involving thriller. I could call it a film noir, except that the sun never sets in the film.</Review>
            <Review>Unfortunately, the emotional landscape of MacLean's stoic main character, Qalli, is often as blank as the tundra.</Review>
            <Review>While Mr. Irelan and a few of the supporting players have some solid moments (the entire cast consists of nonprofessionals), the general vibe is too stilted to convince.</Review>
            <Review>A sturdy vehicle for unadorned morality and pragmatic justice.</Review>
            <Review>MacLean finds a steady rhythm that nicely captures life in the middle of nowhere. "On the Ice" stays frosty throughout, but it's engrossing if you can adjust to the temperature.</Review>
            <Review>Set in a remote Alaskan village, the film's great strength is making the landscape utterly extraordinary to the audience but painfully mundane to its protagonists.</Review>
            <Review>Stark, unadorned, timeless and yet of the moment. Wear your mittens.</Review>
            <Review>DP Lol Crawley's best efforts can't quite overcome the rather awkward performances of the film's mostly nonprofessional cast.</Review>
            <Review>The sympathetic feature debut of a young Inupiat filmmaker, Andrew Okpeaha MacLean.</Review>
            <Review>If "Ice" never really solidifies, it's nonetheless the work of a filmmaker whose seriousness is worth watching out for.</Review>

        <Duration>73</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Phil Carey is his usual rough-and-tumble self in the Columbia western programmer Wyoming Renegade. Carey plays Brady Sutton, a former outlaw who wants to go straight. Trouble is, everyone is convinced that Sutton is still a no-good -- everyone, that is, except heroine Nancy Warren (Martha Hyer). When it appears as though Sutton has joined the "Hole in the Wall" gang headed by Butch Cassidy (Gene Evans), it looks like Nancy was wrong and everyone else was right. Ah, but Sutton's motives are honorable, though it takes him half the movie to prove it. William Bishop is fourth-billed as Butch Cassidy's cohort Sundance, while desperado Blackjack Ketchum makes a cameo appearance in the form of bit player A. Guy Teague. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>A hidden enclave in the shadow of the New York Mets' new stadium, the neighborhood of Willets Point is an industrial zone fated for demolition. Filled with scrapyards and auto salvage shops, lacking sidewalks or sewage lines, the area seems ripe for urban development. But Foreign Parts discovers a strange community where wrecks, refuse and recycling form a thriving commerce. Cars are stripped, sorted and cataloged by brand and part, then resold to an endless parade of drive-thru customers. Joe, the last original resident, rages and rallies through the street like a lost King Lear, trying to contest his imminent eviction. Two lovers, Sara and Luis, struggle for food and safety through the winter while living in an abandoned van. Julia, the homeless queen of the junkyard, exalts in her beatific visions of daily life among the forgotten. The film observes and captures the struggle of a contested "eminent domain" neighborhood before its disappearance under the capitalization of New York's urban ecology. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>Gyro, Jerome, Hope, and Jay are all the typical fundamentalist christian characters you see in most christian films. Both hilarity and hypocrisy ensue as we follow these characters when they are all thrust into real life situations where not just their lives are at stake, but their faith, preconceptions, and perspectives as well. Throw in some Tarantino loving film making, and just a hint of Kevin Smith-esque writing, and you get Jesus Fish.</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>Thomas and Tamara are track stars at their rural New Mexico high school. Like many teenagers, they are torn between the lure of brighter futures elsewhere and the ties that bind them to home. For these teens, however, home is an impoverished town on the Navajo reservation, and leaving means separating from family, tradition and the land that has been theirs for generations. Erica Scharf's ''Up Heartbreak Hill" is a moving look at a new generation of Americans struggling to be both Native and modern.</StoryLine>

            <Review>"Bel Ami" is a handsome production, yet riddled with weaknesses.</Review>
            <Review>The supposedly cunning protagonist registers as a cipher, and the directors' tendency to shoot dialogue scenes in close-up blunts any understanding of the social milieu he's trying to conquer.</Review>
            <Review>The women are all elegant and intelligent, they know the ways of the world, and they know Georges' history. Why do they find him attractive? We don't, and that failure is the downfall of the film.</Review>
            <Review>Pattinson's passion is bloodless, his rakish George Duroy a font of undelivered potential.</Review>
            <Review>Good actors flit in and out of the movie - particularly Kristin Scott Thomas and Colm Meaney - but no one seems able to conquer the essential silliness of it all...</Review>
            <Review>What distinguishes Pattinson in the role is the sense he conveys of someone roiling and churning beneath a surface that is almost, but not quite, calm.</Review>
            <Review>Unfortunately the rather ludicrous camp characteristics of the story, such as Uma Thurman rolling around on Egyptian cotton sheets shouting "Look at the grain exports to Algiers!" are never fully recognised...</Review>
            <Review>"Bel Ami" ends up being a film that feels cold and distant because of the stale lead and a story that makes no room for the affection between any of the couples.</Review>
            <Review>This is the perfect film to cure someone of an obsession with "RPatz".</Review>
            <Review>A gassy, self-satisfied adaptation of the 1885 novel of the same name, threadbare Parisian period piece Bel Ami belies the erroneous notion that costume dramas automatically have a higher IQ than their contemporary dramatic brethren.</Review>
            <Review>Pattinson fails to step up and command this film with his performance, and never settles on anything definitive for his character.</Review>
            <Review>As a caddish young man who seduces his way up the social ladder in late-19th-century Paris, Robert Pattinson looks much more the part than a too-old-for-the-role George Sanders in Hollywood's watered-down 1947 version, The Private Affairs of Bel Ami.</Review>

            <Review>About as factory-produced a film as it's possible to make about the evils of commercialism, while the bulbous, Haribo-hued animation style reflects none of Seuss's visual wit.</Review>
            <Review>May be a diversion for younger children, but it betrays the elegant simplicity of Geisel's vision.</Review>
            <Review>Directors Chris Renaud and Kyle Balda have filled every scene with funny-looking (or sounding) characters, sight gags, and one-liners to provide constant distraction.</Review>
            <Review>Director Chris Renaud and his team have fun with these dithery, frenetic characters. The film is less special when it slows down and takes a breath of fresh air.</Review>
            <Review>This tale is filled with delightful characters and it's sugarcoated with vibrant animation and candy colors.</Review>
            <Review>The badness of the picture is a shock.</Review>
            <Review>Fortunately, there were lots of kids at the screening. You gotta watch 'em. They were giggling, singing along, bouncing, and happily kicking the reviewer's seat. Bingo.</Review>
            <Review>It's heart is in the right place, but the execution isn't quite what it needs to be to excel.</Review>
            <Review>The flat, non-rhyming dialogue and mainly dull new characters don't feel particularly Seussian. But thankfully, the animation does.</Review>
            <Review>Dr. Seuss' The Lorax is an entertaining and cautionary tale that stays true to the spirit of the good doctor.</Review>
            <Review>Three minutes of substance, 91 minutes of shrill filler.</Review>

        <Title>Mia et le Migou (Mia and the Migoo)</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2011</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>92</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Created from an astonishing 500,000 hand-painted frames of animation, the gorgeous second feature from French animator Jacques-R�my Girard is a work of art, breathtaking to behold. Figures are outlined in pencil and then bathed in rustic watercolors, with backgrounds that burst at the seams with painterly detail, like a Miyazaki film painted by Van Gogh. The story is a thrilling family adventure that pits a plucky, wild haired young heroine Mia against profit-hungry developers, with the future of life on Earth in the balance. One night Mia has a premonition. So after saying a few words of parting at her mother's grave, she sets out on a journey across mountains and jungles to search for her father, who has been trapped in a landslide at a disaster-plagued construction site on a remote tropical lake. In the middle of the lake stands the ancient Tree of Life, watched over by innocent, bumbling forest spirits called the Migoo, who grow and change shape as they please, morphing from small childlike beings to petulant giants. It is the Migoo who have been disrupting the construction to protect this sacred site - and now together with Mia - they join in a fight to find Mia's father and save the Tree. -- (C) GKids</StoryLine>

            <Review>So heavy-handed that only the youngest audiences won't feel talked down to. Instead, they're likely to be freaked out.</Review>
            <Review>The story's serviceable, if unexciting, with themes of child-parent love and the importance of peaceful interactions.</Review>
            <Review>Distracting flashes of crude humor dissipate any connection to the characters and odd encounters derail the momentum. And the climax muddles the film's eco message.</Review>
            <Review>This generally involving film is gorgeous to watch thanks to its 500,000 hand-painted frames of vibrantly colored, enormously artistic animation.</Review>
            <Review>The toke-tastic visuals are an endless delight, especially the Migoo themselves, who look like the offspring of McDonald's Grimace and Calvin and Hobbes' killer monster snow goons.</Review>
            <Review>What kind of kid will be able to appreciate this serious plot, which involves investors pulling out of a land-development deal and a scary, knife-wielding witch?</Review>
            <Review>...it is not the words nor the acting that matter here as much as the beautiful visuals which wear the influence of Japanese master Hayao Miyazaki on its sleeve.</Review>
            <Review>The influence of Japanese animation master Hayao Miyazaki is obvious here, and it's a comparison that doesn't flatter French filmmaker Jacques-Remy Girerd's movie.</Review>
            <Review>It's lovely, truly, but so heavy-handed and slipshod that it's probably best enjoyed with the sound off -- an option they're not likely to offer at the movie theater.</Review>
            <Review>Magical realism adventure promotes family, environmentalism.</Review>
            <Review>A cliché-riddled kid's film whose sole inventive hook is its hand-painted, Cray-Pas-by-way-of-water-colors animation style.</Review>

Set in an analysts' office, the story reflects the stream-of-consciousness whining and self-flagellation of Alexander Portnoy, a neurotic, self-absorbed Jewish man with some serious sexual hang-ups, as he tries to sort through his childhood agonies, his somewhat bizarre relationship with his overbearing mother and milquetoast father, Judaism vs. Christianity and his unhealthy relationships with his own body and gentile women, particularly the girl he calls "The Monkey."</StoryLine>

Meanwhile, in the city, 13 year old Ben Barrett (Brandon Taylor Russell) has just been arrested for breaking and entering and grand theft. His mother (Mira Sorvino) at her wits end, Ben is offered the choice of spending three years in juvenile detention, or three months on his grandfather's Jack's farm in Iowa. And no-nonsense Jack (Fonda) isn't about to let his grandson off the hook. Convinced that Ben will adjust more quickly to country life with the help of a friend, Jack goes to the local pound and selects Smitty to keep an eye on his mischievous grandson. Though at first Ben resents the fact that he's suddenly saddled with the responsibility of caring for a dog, a kindly neighbor (Gossett, Jr.) helps to steer the teen down the right path while he reconnects with his family, and learns the importance of responsibility.</StoryLine>

            <Review>While occasionally unpleasant, the film never crosses the line from bearably chilling to unbearably gruesome, keeping its characters credible and its events explicable.</Review>
            <Review>The resolution of its conflicting truths proves so bizarre and idiotically off-the-wall that it mitigates all that precedes it.</Review>
            <Review>Strong performances and a Hitchcock-trained eye build unnerving tension into its depiction of the intimate stress of caring for an invalid and the ways people might or might not crack under it.</Review>
            <Review>A masterful piece of independent filmmaking...</Review>
            <Review>This methodical thriller becomes doubly troubling by ensuring that all of its pieces, in the final appraisal, don't fit together.</Review>
            <Review>an unflinching, character-driven drama</Review>
            <Review>More concerned with the novelty of its three-act, "three-perspective" structure than with how that structure actually functions.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Matt Smith (Doctor Who) and Sam Hoare (Captain America) star in the powerful and uplifting story of an unlikely pair of athletes competing together against all odds in an Olympic games that almost didn't even happen. The fact that the 1948 Olympic games took place at all was miraculous in a London that was still devastated from World War II. Going for Gold - The '48 Games follows the compelling journey to the Olympic final of boatbuilder's son Bert Bushnell (Smith) and Oxford-educated Richard "Dickie" Burnell (Hoare). Thrown together as double sculling partners just six weeks before the games, they had to overcome vast differences in their backgrounds to become a world class rowing team on an International Olympic stage. With compelling supporting performances from James Frain (True Blood) and Geoffrey Palmer (As Time Goes By), Going for Gold - The '48 Games is an inspiring tale worthy of an Olympic gold medal. -- (C) BBC</StoryLine>

            <Review>Lots of silliness, a few nasty kills, and a cool third act.</Review>
            <Review>ATM's flawed premise leads to a film that lacks the necessary tension and character development to keep the audience engaged in the story. Furthermore, the characters' unwillingness to act on their situation merely makes for a very frustrating film.</Review>

        <StoryLine>For Robbing the Dead is a story of compassion - compassion toward those who may seem the least deserving of Christian love. It follows the story of Henry Heath, a law officer in 1862 Salt Lake City. Heath finds himself responsible for the well-being of a prisoner whom he despises - an impoverished French immigrant named Jean Baptiste who is convicted of robbing the graves of the recently deceased. Baptiste is exiled to Antelope Island in the Great Salt Lake. With no one willing to look after this man, Henry Heath becomes Baptiste's sole defense against the hostile isolation of Antelope Island and the contempt of an entire community. Through his somewhat reluctant service, Heath's heart softens and his own sorrows find relief.</StoryLine>

Broken-hearted by her ex, Lol's world is soon turned upside down when she is surprised to find her best friend, Kyle (Douglas Booth), a musician in an up and coming rock band, could possibly be the love of her life. In her quest towards independence, self-identity and young adulthood, Lol discovers that while Facebook "status" is easy to change; true relationships are worth the effort. -- (C) Lionsgate</StoryLine>

            <Review>Endearingly quirky, just this side of precious, but so warm and deftly executed that you go along with it.</Review>
            <Review>"Le Havre" is a passing fancy of a film, but it passes quite nicely indeed.</Review>
            <Review>'Tis the season, so the saying goes. And when it comes to Aki Kaurismäki, it holds true. The Finnish writer-director arrives bearing a gift wrapped in a contemporary immigration fable.</Review>
            <Review>If the bummers and ambiguity of some of this season's movies are getting you down - or, hey, just the bummers and ambiguities of life - make your way to Le Havre. You won't be sorry.</Review>
            <Review>The Finnish director's sense of humor is dry and dark as pitch, as he consistently finds moments of absurdity in the midst of strife and tragedy.</Review>
            <Review>Plays less like a snapshot of Europe wrestling with the realities of immigration and more like a fantasy about how Kaurismaki wishes every immigrant's story would play out.</Review>
            <Review>"Le Havre" is easily the most humanist, generous and hopeful movie in recent memory.</Review>
            <Review>Overly sentimental but warmhearted Marxist message pic.</Review>
            <Review>Kaurismäki returns with another of his deadpan comedies, reminiscent of the great silent comedians, though this one is arguably one of his gentlest as well.</Review>
            <Review>Le Havre is presented as an oasis of happy inclusiveness within a regimented, uniformed, legislated and suspicious world at large; to spend time here is a pleasure.</Review>
            <Review>It's blandly enjoyable, but really, Le Havre is just old-school Hollywood cheese filtered through a semi-ironic lens.</Review>

            <Review>The effect doesn't quite come off, mainly because the images are too sharp and the editing and camera work too modern. But the movie is endearing anyway for its fanboy ardor.</Review>
            <Review>"Whisperer in Darkness" has a chiller-diller conclusion and some moments of real terror.</Review>
            <Review>The filmmakers cared about every moody shadow, every slightly stodgy performance, and (of course) the dark, disturbing imagination of H.P. Lovecraft.</Review>
            <Review>The pacing is unbearably slow, and scenes languish for long minutes in dialogue and suspense-free padding. Whale would never have been so wasteful.</Review>
            <Review>The atmospherics are in place, and the filmmakers catch the essence of Lovecraft's expansive horror with efficiency. The film is entertaining without attaining greatness.</Review>
            <Review>Only a playful horror picture, where Call of Cthulhu was actually a great &amp; largely successful experiment; but it still gets to the heart of why Lovecraft works.</Review>
            <Review>...provides a good reflection of Lovecraft's obsessions while affording contemporary audiences some good old-fashioned midnight movie fun.</Review>

        <StoryLine>In the aftermath of the zombie apocalypse, desperate survivors Elvis and Tweeter flee America for the safety of a tropical island, only to find that the locals have lost their humanity, and pose an even greater danger than the flesh eaters back on familiar shores. In addition to be the first feature film shot on the Canon 7D camera, Dead Season also holds the unique distinction of being the first film shot on the island of Vieques, Puerto Rico since Peter Brook's Lord of the Flies. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>Writer/director Noel Clarke (Kidulthood, Adulthood) returns to the helm for this frenetic urban thriller following four friends who went their separate ways, but find their fates colliding following a chance meeting with a group of ruthless diamond thieves. Jo (Emma Roberts, Cassandra (Tasmin Egerton), Kerrys (Shanika Warren-Markland) and Shannon (Ophelia Lovibond) used to be inseparable, but lately they've begun to grow apart. As Jo struggles for a sense of direction while earning a meager income in a sterlile supermarket, Cassandra races off to New York for a fling with a guy she met online, militant feminist Kerrys wages an unrelenting war against a male dominated society, and Shannon falls into a treacherous, self-destructive tailspin. But just when it seemed as if these old friends were headed down different paths, a brazen crime thrusts them back together for an exhilarating adventure that will prove just how unpredictable life can really be. Sean Pertwee and Kevin Smith co-star. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <ReleaseDate> 1984</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>103</Duration>
        <StoryLine>A teenager and his kid brother spar with their mother's shady new boyfriend in this dramatic thriller from veteran British director Michael Apted. When her ex-husband remarries, Wendy (Teri Garr) feels despondent -- until she starts dating handsome, unctuous Sam (Peter Weller), an underemployed salesman with no shortage of big ideas. Excited to finally feel good about herself again, Wendy invites Sam to move in and offers to invest in his get-rich-quick schemes. None of this sits well with her sons, Jake (Christopher Collet) and Brian (Corey Haim), who remain unimpressed with Sam even after he convinces Wendy to buy Jake a motorbike. They're even less jazzed when Sam stops currying favor and turns disciplinarian even while pulling Wendy into his hard-partying lifestyle. Within a few months, Brian's on the verge of expulsion for picking fights at school, and even honor-role student Jake is mouthing off to his teachers. As for Wendy, she's too busy taking beatings and doing cocaine to notice that her family has fallen apart. It isn't until Jake gets wise to the industrial quantities of white powder squirreled away under the floorboards that he comes up with a plan to get Sam out of their lives forever. Although onetime Tiger Beat heartthrob Christopher Collet plays Firstborn's title role, the films' supporting cast is littered with actors whose stars would far eclipse his (Sarah Jessica Parker, Robert Downey Jr.) -- though in some cases only for a little while (Corey Haim). ~ Brian J.

            <Review>The best things about Firstborn are the easy, natural performances of the actors.</Review>
            <Review>It might have worked if Apted were as adept at creating an emotional atmosphere as he is in his portraiture of the suburban milieu, but too many unshaped scenes and redundant dialogue passages take their toll.</Review>
            <Review>This flawed but interesting Freudian melodrama spends about 70 minutes making points and the last 30 minutes losing them.</Review>
            <Review>A heavy-handed suburban sitcom.</Review>

            <Review>Now a new film of the play appears, adapted and directed by Terence Davies with Rachel Weisz in that stellar [Hester Collyer] role and with Rattigan's work in a freshening treatment.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is an exquisite period piece, slow and dank, and unduly persuaded that it's rendering a classic.</Review>
            <Review>[Weisz'] performance that transforms her from actress to movie star.</Review>
            <Review>The best parts of the movie, like the scene with William's mother, involve isolated set pieces in which Weisz interacts with another actor.</Review>
            <Review>A story of passion and its aftermath; of what happens when an unhappy woman goes chasing after something shiny, only to find how quickly it fades.</Review>
            <Review>Davies doesn't provide stylish counterweights to the heavy drama. Any story that starts with a woman writing a suicide note is cheating us of an honest investment in the outcome.</Review>
            <Review>Weisz makes Hester's dilemma interesting for a while, but even an actress as fine as she can't begin to mold the character into someone worth caring about.</Review>
            <Review>By the time she learns love is less about ideal romance than "wiping someone's ass" when they grow old, it's difficult to care about a problem she created for herself.</Review>
            <Review>The character is a victim of her own decisions, but Weisz's bruised performance in The Deep Blue Sea yields empathy for being battered by doomed romanticism.</Review>
            <Review>The heart wants what it wants and all that; it's anybody's guess why that might be.</Review>
            <Review>Rachel Weisz performs a superb star turn here, but I'm still in a deep funk after watching this gloomy drama.</Review>
            <Review>As rumbling and tremendous a meditation on self and suicide as there's ever been onscreen. Director Terence Davies has now made masterpieces across four decades.</Review>

            <Review>Debutant director Evan Kelly perhaps shows a little too much confidence in Josh McDonald's wordy script and the young cast's ability to pull off a dialogue-heavy set-up, but his handling of cabin-in-the-woods paranoia and its icky outcome is top notch.</Review>
            <Review>It seems like half of genre pics these days begin with a cabin in the woods. As such, "The Corridor" is alternately offbeat and derivative, reminiscent of a "Twilight Zone" episode without a satisfying payoff.</Review>

            <Review>The whole claustrophobic one-man show feels like we've been here before, and with better material.</Review>
            <Review>There are plenty of gripping moments, as well as a few silly ones - bees get involved at one point, presumably to please Wicker Man fans. And the ride as a whole is at the very least exciting to take part in.</Review>
            <Review>Talk about being boxed in: This thriller is half-"24," half-"Buried" and, despite a few twists, unable to move anywhere.</Review>
            <Review>Brake may not be the kind of film that Dorff's thesp character in Sofia Coppola's Somewhere is pining for, but the actor fully commits to the arduous demands of the part.</Review>
            <Review>Dorff and Torres make a lot out of very little, always keeping the audience aware of the larger world outside the small, dark space in which they've trapped us.</Review>
            <Review>It is amazing how much hair-raising action and fluid movement this film captures in the confined interior of a car trunk, or how many mood shifts Mr. Dorff conveys in a performance that can only be called multi-dimensional.</Review>
            <Review>While the film is suspenseful for awhile, it ultimately becomes a let down because of a stretched out story and an absurd ending.</Review>
            <Review>Most of it is a decent film despite it being stretched out, but most of it being good just doesn't cut it.</Review>
            <Review>It's a clever B-movie that has a number of fun twists up its sleeve.</Review>
            <Review>...a second-rate carbon-copy of Rodrigo Cortés' vastly superior Buried.</Review>
            <Review>Over 95% of "Brake" takes place in the trunk of a car. But, despite the confines or perhaps because of them, it's a decent enough thriller.</Review>
            <Review>In a movie like this, almost everything depends on the lead actor -- and Stephen Dorff does not disappoint. He turns in a splended 'confined' performance here.</Review>

            <Review>Newcomer Jason Yee proves plenty adept at chopsocky, but his chops are nonexistent on the thesping side.</Review>
            <Review>In its moments of sometimes comically violent antagonism, the movie shows some flashes of genre pizazz.</Review>
            <Review>At times off-putting, at other times outright campy, "The Girl From the Naked Eye" does offer a measured amount of queasy fun.</Review>
            <Review>There's a lot to like about the action film "The Girl From the Naked Eye," especially some crisp martial arts fight sequences and the subtle sense of humor that surfaces now and then.</Review>
            <Review>Could easily be relabeled Sin City Lite.</Review>
            <Review>It isn't a great movie, but it looks terrific and makes me look forward to the next film by its director, David Ren.</Review>
            <Review>It's a pretty good little noir with excellent fighting and the usual story. I liked the tone, I liked the photography, and I liked the characters. The pace is a little maddening, but the film is ultimately efficient.</Review>
            <Review>A pulpy, low-budget slice of film noir cross-pollinated with a martial arts flick, this Girl wins no awards for great originality but nonetheless serves as a stylish and engaging vehicle for the surly charms of Jason Yee.</Review>
            <Review>It might be difficult to stifle laughter while watching this stylish but overwrought noir thriller.</Review>
            <Review>A compelling chopsocky made in America, featuring a homegrown matinee idol who might very well blossom into the next Bruce Lee.</Review>
            <Review>The best thing to come from the film is a desire to see what Ren and friends do next... hopefully with an even bigger budget.</Review>
            <Review>I can't say that I was ever really bored by it.</Review>

            <Review>Writer-director Chris Fisher flirts with over-the-top exaggeration so often during Meeting Evil that auds might wish he'd gone all the way and dialed everything up to 11.</Review>
            <Review>It features tons of poor decisions, from the overwrought and intrusive musical score to bad-joke one liners from the main characters down to the supporting ones. The worst decision either actor made was actually appearing in this awful film.</Review>
            <Review>A cheap slasher flick with some talented actors masking the banality with clever dialogue...</Review>
            <Review>...just another hopelessly incompetent direct-to-video thriller...</Review>
            <Review>If you don't mind style over substance, a bit of the old cat-and-mouse, and you enjoy watching Samuel L. Jackson making people squirm, then hop in, strap up, and hold on.</Review>
            <Review>Samuel L. Jackson has fun chewing the scenery as a deranged killer in this otherwise formulaic thriller.</Review>
            <Review>Chris Fisher so over-directs his material that the action takes on the sheen of a parody or, at least, of a film that doesn't realize its clichés are being exaggerated to the point of absurdity.</Review>
            <Review>If you can put aside your preconceived notions and enjoy the movie for what it is, you may be pleasantly surprised by what the bizarrely entertaining Meeting Evil has to offer.</Review>
            <Review>There's something about seeing Samuel L. Jackson with a gun and an attitude that promises more than this meager effort is willing to offer.</Review>

Julian Varone was an undercover cop who made a terrible mistake. As a result, Darraylynn Warren lay dead in the street.

As the stress of their failing chicken farm takes a toll on their once-happy relationship, Millie (Christy Scott Cashman) and Al (Jay Harrington) receive an unusual offer that could help to patch up the holes in their troubled marriage. Ambitious reality television producer Ira (Michael Panes) sees them as the perfect participants for "Cut the Crap", a reality series in which free-spirited yogi Angela Lovecraft (Posey) uses her mystical skills to help people through hard times. But when the cameras start to roll, Ira realizes that the show isn't working. Determined to make "Cut the Crap" a hit, he convinces Millie that Al is being unfaithful, effectively expanding the cracks in the couple's rapidly-deteriorating relationship. Meanwhile, Angela focuses all of her New Age energy on keeping Al and Millie together, and learns a little something unexpected about herself in the process. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>Filmmakers Chris Kentis and Laura Lau ('Open Water') should have plugged the original's plot holes and straightened out its logic.</Review>
            <Review>The camera's unblinking eye constantly stays with Olsen, and we feel in as much danger as she is.</Review>
            <Review>It's Olsen's performance that makes Sarah's plight matter. And the actress proves that her mesmerizing turn in last fall's Martha Marcy May Marlene -- about a woman on the lam from a cult -- wasn't a fluke.</Review>
            <Review>Silent House feels like a psychotic episode come to life. It's impressive and oppressive, and it very effectively gets on your nerves.</Review>
            <Review>[Olsen is] terrific at showing shifts of emotion just underneath the skin of her wide, china-doll face.</Review>
            <Review>Paranormal Activity has been here before, of course, but Silent House springs tangy new tricks, and Olsen is a primo scream queen.</Review>
            <Review>As a technical experiment in real time cinema, Silent House is fascinating, but it fails as both an interesting story and a visceral experience.</Review>
            <Review>Although it has plenty of atmosphere and tense moments, Silent House is ultimately lacking in every other department.</Review>
            <Review>Moviegoers looking for a unique horror-thriller experience, who find the "real time" premise intriguing, are likely to enjoy Silent House in spite of its flaws.</Review>
            <Review>[Elizabeth Olsen's] impressive portrayal - and even an admittedly interesting overall conclusion - just isn't enough to rescue a film that is literally agonising to watch.</Review>

Shortly after her husband Roman (Borys Szyc), an officer in the Polish Army, departs to fight on the front lines of World War II, young mother Nina (Agnieszka Grochowska) and her infant son are forced from their home by Russian soldiers, and escorted into the barren, infinite plains of Siberia. There, under the watch of cold and callous soldiers, Nina and the rest of the prisoners are forced to perform backbreaking manual labor. When her child falls ill and her captors refuse to provide him treatment, Nina makes a daring escape, placing her son's life in the hands of Kazakh nomads, and refusing to give up hope that he will survive their harrowing ordeal.</StoryLine>

            <Review>By the time this graceful film is over you understand why Japan has declared the bald, bespectacled Jiro a national treasure. Even if you've never tasted sushi, the man's singleness of purpose will inspire you.</Review>

            <Review>This documentary strikes a balance between storytelling and food porn that's hard to come by in foodie flicks. Like a proper sushi meal, "Jiro" left me feeling sated, not stuffed.</Review>

            <Review>Gelb also provides an education on the different kinds of sushi, the purveyors of premium fish and rice, and overfishing. But it's his lyrical, lovingly photographed scenes of preparation that elevates the documentary to a work of art.</Review>

When Eliezer learns that he is to be awarded the Israel Prize, the most valuable honor for scholarship in the country, his vanity and desperate need for validation are exposed. His son Uriel, meanwhile, is thrilled to see his father's achievements finally recognized but, in a darkly funny twist, is forced to choose between the advancement of his own career and his father's.

After the state's government helped fund a push toward genetic modification for the famed local crop, filmmakers were able to insist upon a rare interview with a genetic researcher on the project from NMSU, who discusses benefits and risks of altering the crop. ~ Cammila Collar, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>Norwegian director/writer Pal Sletaune appears to have been influenced by Roman Polanski, but The Monitor is more oppressive than haunting. There is little or no sense of dread. The climax is predictable.</Review>
            <Review>The Monitor is one of the better psychological thrillers I've seen in awhile.</Review>
            <Review>(Noomy) Rapace gives the performance of the week ( ... ) on this form I could watch her all day long</Review>
            <Review>Rapace again proves herself to be a fearless actress, especially when Babycall is delivering elements which are as unsettling as something like Robin Williams' One Hour Photo.</Review>
            <Review>Provides an effectively unsettling counterpart to glossier chillers of its ilk.</Review>
            <Review>The film and Rapace command our attention, though at the end one feels Norway has used up the whole of this year's quota of red herrings.</Review>
            <Review>Quote not available.</Review>
            <Review>The movie makes less and less effort to keep us up to speed - it's a reasonable assumption that a lot of it's going on inside Rapace's head, but determining precisely how much feels like a fool's errand.</Review>

        <Duration>135</Duration>
        <StoryLine>The infamous Countess Erzsebet Bathory, who is said to have maintained youth and beauty into her old age by bathing in the blood of virgins, has her life story told in a more balanced but still provocative manner in this grand-scale historical drama. Bathory, played by Anna Freil, is portrayed in three important episodes from her life. Bathory falls in love with the legendary artist Caravaggio (Hans Matheson) and attempts to win his heart, which doesn't much amuse her husband Ferenc Nadasy (Vincent Regan). Later, Bathory becomes close friends with Darvulia (Deana Jakubiskova), a woman said to have remarkable healing powers, as observers remark upon Bathory's beauty which seems impervious to the passage of time or the stress of her life. And after the death of her husband, Bathory rises to a position of political power in Hungary, as Palatine Thurzo (Karel Roden) leads a plot to scuttle her ambitions. Bathory also features Bolek Polivka as a monk who narrates the countess's remarkable story. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>Kang Je-kyu's big-budgeted WWII melodrama offers up a kitschy, overtly violent tale about two rival marathon runners caught in a continent-hopping battle of blood, guts and bad dialogue.</Review>
            <Review>[Director Kang Je-kyu] engineers one long pummel session of elaborate CGI effects, shaky battle cinematography and trial-by-fire heroics, but the nonstop adversity lacks any real sense of danger. Or, for that matter, emotional punch.</Review>
            <Review>This is big-boned, epic filmmaking of a variety Cecil B. DeMille or D.W. Griffith would appreciate.</Review>
            <Review>The paeans about national pride and brotherhood may be regional, but constant slow-motion battle scenes and squishy sentimentality are strictly wanna-be Tinseltown.</Review>
            <Review>Just don't expect much in the plot department.</Review>
            <Review>They should have spent more on the screenplay.</Review>
            <Review>The film runs for almost two and a half hours and features some brutal scenes of combat, but the acting is fine and the locations, scouted for two years and shot over almost six months, are stunning.</Review>
            <Review>In a movie that is so visually right -- from costumes to sets to effects -- it is highly disappointing to see the script go so wrong.</Review>
            <Review>The twisty narrative resembles a trashy, brain-drained version of the Japanese mega-epic The Human Condition -- at a fifth the length -- that's been crossed with The Fox and the Hound.</Review>
            <Review>The film's drama fails because it's underdone, but it's also undone by a soaring, swelling score and an overly strong nationalist agenda.</Review>
            <Review>The story of two marathon runners... who play musical chairs with military uniforms in stumbling their way from China to Omaha Beach over the course of WWII... might well have been titled 'Chariots of Cliches.'</Review>

Events grow darker and more twisted when Kathleen turns up dead in an apparent accident, and then Stacy herself mysteriously vanishes.

            <Review>This great poem on the end of the world is truly a film for the ages. It can't really be described, but only lived.</Review>
            <Review>No movie could possibly live up to the monumental, forbidding grandeur of The Turin Horse's lengthy opening shot, but [Bela Tarr]... goes ahead and attempts the impossible, and comes frighteningly close to succeeding.</Review>
            <Review>"The Turin Horse" is a parable, which means it's both very simple and very weighty. It's not about event and emotion, but duration and endurance.</Review>
            <Review>It feels like the creation story in reverse -- a terrible, unavoidable walk into the dark.</Review>
            <Review>Through Tarr's meticulous vision, these ordinary hardships take on cosmic weight; this is tedium vividly rendered.</Review>
            <Review>An intentionally monotonous look at the lives of a farmer and his daughter. Strange events signal the end is nigh, but it approaches at the pace of a lethargic inchworm.</Review>
            <Review>Deeply pessimistic but cinematically radiant take on the futility of existence.</Review>
            <Review>This film seems to imply that non-existence is preferable to existence. Some people feel that way, but I wish they would keep it to themselves and not inflict this on others through this kind of media.</Review>
            <Review>"The Turin Horse" is an existential provocation to its audience, demanding that we consider the effect of man's judgments against nature and ultimately against ourselves.</Review>
            <Review>Though a heavy and somnolent watch and not for all tastes, it has redeeming value for being so full of reality.</Review>

        <Duration>88</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Over the past century more than 45,000 large dams have redefined river corridors around the globe with disastrous results. Descending the Baker River from the Northern Patagonia Ice-cap to its terminus at the Pacific Ocean, Patagonia Rising investigates a controversial plan to build five large hydroelectric dams in Chile's famed wilderness. Stopping off at Patagonia's most remote frontier ranches, this engaging story brings voice to the iconic South American cowboys, Gauchos, caught in the crossfire of future energy demands. Chile could become a leader in sustainable energy development, or it could continue down the road to squandering the pure watersheds of Patagonia. Juxtaposing the pro-dam business sector with renewable energy experts, Patagonia Rising brings intimate awareness to this global conflict over water and power. -- (C) First Run</StoryLine>

            <Review>Only Scott Thomas, biting off all her sentences like a piranha, rescues "Salmon Fishing" from being a by-the-numbers romantic comedy; you wish the redoubtable Ms. Maxwell had her own movie.</Review>

            <Review>A charming little movie.</Review>
            <Review>Hallström's made a wonderful film about the power of faith. Flyfishing in a manufactured trout stream in the middle of the desert is a faith-based activity, declares the sheik who built it.</Review>
            <Review>It's an affable, inoffensive British comedy that just wants you to like it so much that you can't help but snicker behind its back.</Review>
            <Review>To say this movie requires an utter suspension of disbelief is a vast understatement.</Review>

            <Review>Why do so many horror movies that begin with promise fall apart in the final act?</Review>
            <Review>If you don't guess the big twist in the first 30 minutes, "Intruders" is half of a good movie. If you do, it's about a third of a good movie.</Review>
            <Review>It's a pleasure to find that Mr. Fresnadillo has assumed the mantle of horror classicist to make "Intruders," using shadows and directorial sleights of hand to coax forth its slow-building scares rather than just pouring on the usual guts and gore.</Review>
            <Review>Clive Owen's daddy issues are getting out of hand.</Review>
            <Review>Don't tease that we might see a face get torn off and only give us what amounts to several noogies-from-the-beyond.</Review>
            <Review>I could think of a half dozen things that INTRUDERS almost says, but the film doesn't take the time to actually say any of them.</Review>
            <Review>Intruders is a thriller hybrid that goes a long way and it is definitely worth the watch.</Review>
            <Review>"Intruders" is a horror film that has absolutely nothing memorable or noteworthy about it.</Review>
            <Review>The story jumps back and forth between the two countries and quickly becomes tedious and only mildly scary. The ending might surprise you if you manage to stay awake. A compelling story with more chills and a clearer plotline could have helped.</Review>

            <Review>[It] doesn't offer up a ton of narrative surprises, but there is plenty going on the screen to keep you engaged - and visually stimulated.</Review>
            <Review>You must be willing to give yourself to Braden King's debut feature, a slow, meandering and sumptuously photographed road trip combined with an intimate love story. I gave, and I got. A lot.</Review>
            <Review>"Here" seems motivated by a tone of searching and yearning, not of finding a single way. As Foster's character says at one point, "Getting lost was the goal."</Review>
            <Review>It becomes highly affecting, concerned both with the limits of mapping a landscape and with lovers' difficulties in navigating each other.</Review>
            <Review>The trains of thought stirred up by the film's contemplation of what is here and what is there - and where you are - are endless and stimulating. And the movie is embellished with spectacularly beautiful, enigmatic bursts of abstract imagery.</Review>
            <Review>The unstructured, come-what-may quality of a road movie is part of its appeal, but it can be a pitfall, too, when all that spontaneity starts to look more like lollygagging.</Review>
            <Review>Grapples with the very idea of wanderlust, eventually coming to look at it as both a state of grace and an appealing delusion.</Review>
            <Review>Languid road movie, punctuated by ponderous abstract interludes, about a young American mapmaker in Armenia who meets a prodigal woman photographer. A promising filmmaker needs to his lose art-school baby fat.</Review>
            <Review>While everything here is mostly unspoken, and the film itself hints at a broader set of concerns than simply two lost souls meeting on foreign ground, Here too often feels like a jumble of ideas that don't quite cohere.</Review>
            <Review>In HERE, the landscape doesn't become a character, as the boilerplate cliché would have it, but the brief-encounter romance becomes a proto-documentary.</Review>
            <Review>One of those movies so fully achieved it restores your faith in the cinema.</Review>
            <Review>Viewers get ample time to luxuriate in the landscapes while gritting our teeth over Peter Coyote's pseudomythic narration and the sort of WTF meta touches that a first-year film student might find ridiculous.</Review>

            <Review>Almost invigorating in its disreputability; it's both cheesy and striking, corny and bold, dismissible and yet strangely appealing for its singularity.</Review>
            <Review>Those who miss the days of Gibson's hardened movie characters will be in for a treat with Get the Gringo, a genuinely gritty, hard-boiled action-noir tale.</Review>
            <Review>Gibson, for all his offscreen controversy, still has his star-quality charisma, and Grunberg is a worthy protege for the Oscar-winning writer/actor/director.</Review>
            <Review>Get The Gringo is a passable addition to the action genre but it might have been better had the need to keep Gibson's fan base happy not been so pressing.</Review>
            <Review>This is a return to form for [Mel Gibson], playing a hard-edged tough-nut with personality. And it's easily his most charismatic role in over a decade.</Review>
            <Review>Things start off a little too cute with that self-aware, annoying post-Pulp Fiction faux-clever tough-guy winking narration, but it kind of straightens up a bit once the story kicks in.</Review>
            <Review>Very entertaining with a 24-karat star performance by the always-welcome Mel Gibson.</Review>
            <Review>an entertaining but trashy crime drama</Review>
            <Review>It could have been too quirky for its own good, [but] as it stands... "Get the Gringo" is surprisingly good, coming out of left field the way it did.</Review>
            <Review>Get the Gringo is a gritty film with some grizzled punch. Gibson himself gives a strong performance as a hardened criminal that still has some heart.</Review>
            <Review>Might not be a Lethal Weapon-style comeback for Mel the Action Star, but it works well enough as a double feature with Gibson's underrated Payback.</Review>

            <Review>It's clichéd, ridiculous, and very entertaining.</Review>
            <Review>The tag-team of filmmakers seems to have only two ideas - having stupendously ugly characters shove their mugs into the camera, or staging action sequences so dizzily you have no idea what's going on.</Review>
            <Review>Does a fine job of continually coming up with obstacle after obstacle for our two leads to dodge - not the least of which happens to be good, old-fashioned logic.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Poetry, politics, madness, and desire collide in the true story of the woman hailed as South Africa's Sylvia Plath. In 1960s Cape Town, as Apartheid steals the expressive rights of blacks and whites alike, young Ingrid Jonker (Carice van Houten) finds her freedom scrawling verse while frittering through a series of stormy affairs. Amid escalating quarrels with her lovers and her rigid father, a parliament censorship minister (Rutger Hauer), the poet witnesses an unconscionable event that will alter the course of both her artistic and personal lives. -- (C) Tribeca</StoryLine>

            <Review>Van Houten ... gives a strong performance as Jonker, and the cinematography is pleasing, but the script is cliché-ridden and ends on an overly sentimental note.</Review>
            <Review>The movie reminds you of the extent to which poetry has been marginalized as a cultural force since the early 1960s.</Review>
            <Review>Black Butterflies scarcely tries to illuminate the substance of Jonker's writing.</Review>
            <Review>Black Butterflies is a dark, moving depiction of the life and death of a brave rebellious, idiosyncratic woman who made significant strides toward changing the world around her and paid a heavy toll for her passion.</Review>
            <Review>Always feels like a life schematically condensed rather than intimately explored.</Review>
            <Review>Art, politics, and craziness conspire to form a rather mechanical melodrama in Black Butterflies...</Review>
            <Review>Black Butterflies is the sad human poetry of the lost souls who slip beneath the waves to echo in our collective consciousness.</Review>
            <Review>The screenplay defiantly never softens [Ingrid] Jonker, but challenges the audience to take her or leave her.</Review>
            <Review>As far as middlebrow biopics go, it may not break any molds, but it's a reasonably sensitive and occasionally insightful look into the mind and psyche of an impassioned and deeply troubled artist.</Review>

            <Review>It's often a lot of fun with some dance numbers thrown in.</Review>
            <Review>It's simultaneously a very knowing and strangely innocent film...</Review>
            <Review>The best that can be said for The Fairy is that it certainly creates its own world. However, it's one I wanted to get out of almost as soon as it began.</Review>
            <Review>I personally admired and cringed at about the same time.</Review>

        <StoryLine>In a world where e-mail and text messaging is changing the way young people communicate, a handful of students learn the power of writing letters the old fashioned way in this documentary from filmmakers Dave LaMattina and Chad N. Walker. A sixth grade class in Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant district is given an assignment to become pen pals with kids from another country. But the youngsters are not communicating with typical overseas students -- they begin exchanging letters with orphans from Sierra Leone who are struggling to get by in the wake of the nation's brutal civil war. Bed-Stuy may be a lower-middle class neighborhood in the eyes of many, but the hand-written letters and snapshots from their new friends open the students' eyes to the hardships suffered in the rest of the world. When one of the kids from Sierra Leone expresses his desire to help others even less fortunate than themselves, their American pals step forward to make a difference, setting up a barbeque as a fund raiser for their compatriots. Brownstones To Red Dirt was an official selection at the 2010 Seattle International Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>A bone-dry and nearly pitch-perfect combo of romantic comedy, absurdist farce and alien-invasion drama...</Review>
            <Review>A tiresome roundelay of lies, lust and leaping paranoia.</Review>
            <Review>As comedies go, it's as dry as bleached bones in the desert, but you can't blame Vigalondo for taking another shot at cleverness.</Review>
            <Review>There is originality, certainly. But Vigalondo teased us with the moon and the stars, and delivered only the terrestrial.</Review>
            <Review>Quirky, but infinitely more interesting than big-budget Hollywood cousins.</Review>
            <Review>Few alien invasion films are this charming, this witty, and this free of aliens.</Review>
            <Review>Extraterrestrial comes out of left field with characteristic charm and unexpected plotlines, but it delights nonetheless.</Review>
            <Review>"Extraterrestrial" becomes a comedy of one-lie-after-another. And, a great deal of it is funny/interesting enough to keep you locked into the story, even as you wait and wait and wait for the aliens TO DO SOMETHING.</Review>
            <Review>Vigalondo makes the most of a handful of locations while bouncing romantic farce off a (largely unseen) world-changing event.</Review>
            <Review>If Extraterrestrial is to explore what might be called Third Wheel Syndrome, Vigalondo needed to bring greater tension to the romantic triangle than what exists.</Review>
            <Review>Never quite the feature most will expect it to be, Extraterrestrial is a charming submission of low-fi scripting, using a colossal development in universal happenings to reinforce the quirks and hazards of love.</Review>

        <Duration>85</Duration>
        <StoryLine>In a large apartment high above the city lives our couple. They're in love. She's a painter, he's a successful actor. Just a normal afternoon - except that this isn't a normal afternoon, for them or anyone else. Because tomorrow, at 4:44 am, give or take a few seconds, the world will come to an end far more rapidly than even the worst doomsayer could have imagined. The final meltdown will come not without warnings, but with no means of escape. There will be no survivors. As always, there are those who, as their last cigarette is being lit and the blindfold tightened, will still hope against hope for some kind of reprieve. For a miracle. Not our two lovers. They - like the majority of the Earth's population - have accepted their fate: the world is going to end. -- (C) IFC</StoryLine>

            <Review>Though it gains traction toward the end, viewers may finally feel puzzled or indifferent. You expect a bit more from the end of the world.</Review>
            <Review>Rehashing old arguments in the hours before certain death is a tedious waste of time - theirs, and ours.</Review>
            <Review>If the end of the world was just hours away, would New Yorkers still be able to get takeout? Yes, if Abel Ferrara's mind-bending "4:44 Last Day on Earth'' is any indication.</Review>
            <Review>Ferrara movingly celebrates connection, cooking life down to just its barest essence: a man, a woman and a need.</Review>
            <Review>Ferrara doesn't give his protagonists room to do much beyond have arguments and sex (though the intimacy is shot well).</Review>
            <Review>Your last day - or, as it happens, the whole planet's last day - will be just like every other one. Mr. Ferrara makes this point with ingenuity and characteristic thrift by using found news footage to provide images of apocalypse.</Review>
            <Review>4:44: Last Day on Earth quickly devolves into an absolutely endless piece of work that's rife with laughably avant-garde elements and underdeveloped, one-dimensional characters.</Review>
            <Review>Intermittently captures the sense of human desperation it strives for, as if to say the best we can hope for is to crawl past the finish line.</Review>
            <Review>Too many things were left unexplained about the end of the world. Why not a greater sense of panic? How was the internet still up and running so smoothly? I'm just one of those guys who wants everything to fit into place by the end. It didn't.</Review>
            <Review>An exercise in emotional tedium.</Review>
            <Review>Uncompromising in its hallucinatory qualities and densely symbolic, 4:44 is a difficult sit, better appreciated for its appealing thespian swings than any of its intended meaning.</Review>
            <Review>... the last thing we'd expect from the aging enfant terrible behind Bad Lieutenant and King of New York ... comes off as a somber testimonial/warning commissioned by a think tank overseen by Al Gore ...</Review>

            <Review>Odd, intermittently amusing but wholly unsatisfying, an oddball experiment that simply doesn't work.</Review>
            <Review>As a low-budget independent not necessarily intended for a broad audience, Casa doesn't have to bow to the middle-of-the-road multiplex appeal that handcuffs many SNL-pedigreed films. That works to the film's great benefit.</Review>
            <Review>I tend to be amused by Ferrell in most circumstances, and the things I like about him - his bizarre sensibilities hidden beneath a mainstream exterior, his unwavering sincerity regardless of his characters' absurdity - are on display here.</Review>
            <Review>I regard Casa de Mi Padre as an interesting but failed experiment.</Review>
            <Review>Ferrell is an hombre loco. Mi gusta.</Review>
            <Review>Will Ferrell tiene cojones grandes.</Review>
            <Review>Casa de Mi Padre is an amiable but eventually tiresome Spanish-language goof of telenovelas and floridly melodramatic, moustache-twirling westerns.</Review>
            <Review>Even if you're making a bad movie on purpose, it's still a bad movie.</Review>
            <Review>Fundamentally, it seems the big joke of Casa de Mi Padre is that it was produced at all, and as a weird Dadaist joke it is indeed satisfying. It's hard, however, to recommend a film that feels like a giant prank.</Review>
            <Review>Unfortunately for Casa de Mi Padre there's a very fine line between smart-stupid and slapdash-stupid.</Review>
            <Review>[S]ubtle humor that slips under your radar instead of bashing you over the head is what makes Casa one of the more adventurous comedies in recent years...</Review>

        <Title>The Cross of Lorraine</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 1943</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>90</Duration>
        <StoryLine>The time is World War II. A group of disillusioned French soldiers are approached by Nazi troops and promised safe passage to their homeland. The Frenchmen willingly surrender, only to discover that their next destination is a German concentration camp located near a Gallic village. The anticipated escape attempt results in an uprising from the French villagers--hence the film's title, which refers to the emblem of the Free-French underground. Cross of Lorraine compensates for its Hollywood's-eye view of France (no more realistic than the Paris of the Ernst Lubitsch musicals) with some remarkably graphic sequences showing the extent of German brutality. The melting-pot cast includes Frenchman Jean-Pierre Aumont as a patriot, Hungarian Peter Lorre as a hateful Nazi, American Gene Kelly as a cynical victim of German torture, and Canadian Hume Cronyn as the traditionally rodent-like informer.</StoryLine>

            <Review>'The Three Stooges' is exactly the film it wants to be. Was it worth ten years of anyone's life? Probably not. Is it worth 88 minutes of yours? Absolutely.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is so infantile that it achieves a special kind of purity and gentleness.</Review>
            <Review>The metafriction between these classic dupes and today's idiots chafes uneasily.</Review>
            <Review>The leads acquit themselves in the physical comedy, resurrecting shtick honed on a thousand-and-one vaudeville stages, and recreated in as many playgrounds.</Review>
            <Review>Any reasonable objections to the Farrellys' Three Stooges will not be on the grounds that it desecrates a revered comedy franchise, but on the grounds that it's not very funny.</Review>
            <Review>If this is a tribute, it's a crass and clumsy one.</Review>
            <Review>When the movie works, it can derive some raucous laughter...</Review>
            <Review>It's innocent and silly and brainless and funny. This is not a dumb comedy done smartly; this is a dumb comedy done dumbly.</Review>
            <Review>Short, silly and charmingly harmless, it's likely only the Stooges aficionados will find a whole lot to love.</Review>
            <Review>Stooges will resonate strongly or not at all, depending on the viewer. But a Jersey Shore experience is about where the film falls short of honorable intentions.</Review>
            <Review>The Farrelly brothers return to the vacuously silly style of Dumb and Dumber for this gently idiotic comedy</Review>
            <Review>It's absurd, it's mindless, it's infantine but it's also bizarrely charming.</Review>

            <Review>Filmmaker Leberecht takes an intriguingly askance approach to the vampire genre with this dark, romantic horror film, but after after a promising set-up seems unsure where to go from there.</Review>
            <Review>It's a frightening story, plausibly developed within a relatively brief running time, and the central love between the male protagonist increasingly addicted to blood and a girl addicted to cocaine is oddly moving.</Review>
            <Review>Visually and narratively, Midnight Son leads us confidently into territory we almost never see, but even when things start to feel familiar, Leberecht throws us a curve ball ...</Review>
            <Review>It might not be offering anything new to the lore of the horror film, but Midnight Son is a confident, minor work that hardcore admirers of the True Blood/Twilight cycle will want to seek out.</Review>
            <Review>Horror films driven by ideas are thin on the ground, but behind the gory façade of Scott Leberecht's debut feature there ticks some cleverly assembled clockwork.</Review>
            <Review>A thoughtful tale that is more a twisted romance than a typical shocker.</Review>
            <Review>Better made and imagined than most [horror films].</Review>
            <Review>Yet another tortured-emo vampire movie, but there's an attempt to inject a dose of plausible realism into proceedings, rather than Twilight's leaden coffee-table stylings.</Review>
            <Review>The film plugs its holes with a curdled blankness.</Review>
            <Review>A bloody and well-acted vampire curio.</Review>
            <Review>Leberecht plays games with vampire lore, but skirts around it with a subtlety and delicacy that lends his film emotional depths rare in low-budget horror.</Review>
            <Review>Scott Leberecht should be commended for his ability to turn a low budget independent flick into somewhat of a surprise success, and Zak Kilberg deserves to be recognized for what should be his breakout performance.</Review>

        <Duration>91</Duration>
        <StoryLine>An unofficial remake of The Champ, The Clown concerns Dodo Delwyn (Red Skelton), a down-and-out performer with abundant and obvious talent, but also a self-destructive tendency to overindulge his drinking and gambling habits. Once a Ziegfeld headliner, Dodo is now lucky to get jobs playing a clown at cheap amusement parks and even cheaper burlesque. Dodo's addictions cost him his marriage, but he somehow is able to maintain custody of his son Dink (Tim Considine), whose love for and faith in his father knows no bounds. Dink and Dodo's desperate need for each other is threatened when Dink's mother -- married again and capable of providing him with a better life -- reappears and explains that she wants to take care of the boy herself. Dink goes behind his father's back to locate his old agent, and begs him to help Dodo; but the agent cannot do anything. Dink goes away with his mother, but is miserable and runs back to his father. The agent, meanwhile, has managed to wrangle a TV show for Dodo -- and now that his son is back and needs him, Dodo resolves to find the courage to take up this offer and make a success of it. ~ Craig Butler, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>In 1937, Nanking stands at the forefront of a war between China and Japan. As the invading Japanese Imperial Army overruns China's capital city, desperate civilians seek refuge behind the nominally protective walls of a western cathedral. Here, John Miller (Christian Bale), an American trapped amidst the chaos of battle and the ensuing occupation takes shelter, joined by a group of innocent schoolgirls and thirteen courtesans, equally determined to escape the horrors taking place outside the church walls. Struggling to survive the violence and persecution wrought by the Japanese army, it is an act of heroism which eventually leads the seemingly disparate group to fight back, risking their lives for the sake of everyone. -- (C) Wrekin Hill</StoryLine>

            <Review>"The Flowers of War" seems like a pretty good film until you begin to think about it.</Review>
            <Review>An unsettling mixture of spectacular brutality and sentimentality that might make even Steven Spielberg blush.</Review>
            <Review>The director's grip on the drama is often weakened by his penchant for creating spectacles.</Review>
            <Review>All Zhang's splendor does is foster cognitive dissonance in an audience.</Review>
            <Review>A strange hybrid of "City of Life and Death" and "Father Goose" that nevertheless, in the hands of Zhang Yimou, musters a few striking moments.</Review>
            <Review>A florid, melodramatic tear-jerker of questionable taste but undeniable emotional impact.</Review>
            <Review>The filming techniques cross Saving Private Ryan with Zimou's own Hero and other dynastic, martial arts-driven Chinese epics.</Review>
            <Review>It contributes nothing of value to an understanding of these events.</Review>

            <Review>He might be guilty of showboating, but De Niro's knockout performance is a declaration that the star of "Raging Bull" isn't ready to hang up his gloves.</Review>

            <Review>Heads downward in every sense of the word.</Review>
            <Review>For a movie that deals with suicide, homelessness and cocaine addiction, writer-director Paul Weitz's latest family drama feels strangely bland.</Review>
            <Review>I'm still not sure what this is all supposed to be about, save for a bunch of scenes that happened to somebody, sometime.</Review>
            <Review>DeNiro is more "personality" than actor now.</Review>
            <Review>De Niro has succumbed to the false perception that 'great acting' is synonymous with screaming and yelling every line like your career depended on it.</Review>
            <Review>Being Flynn is too dark to appeal to the faint of heart and too safe to draw in those looking for an honest portrayal of a troubled father-son relationship.</Review>
            <Review>It's a shame the studio didn't choose to keep the original title of the book in place, Another Bulls**t Night in Suck City would have been quite fitting for the film.</Review>
            <Review>Eventually, the movie warps in on itself and becomes its own parody: an overly pretentious movie about an overly pretentious writer, which is not very well written at all.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Over the last decade, Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) has grown from a controversial no-holds-barred gladiatorial sideshow into a billion dollar phenomenon eclipsing boxing as the dominant combat sport in the world. But far from Las Vegas, in sweat-soaked gyms and low-rent arenas across America, the big lights are but a dream. Here, men fight to test their mettle, fortified with the mythic promise that an ordinary man can transform into a champion. Fightville is about the art and sport of fighting: a microcosm of life, a physical manifestation of that other brutal contest called the American Dream, where men are not born, but built through self determination, hard work and faith. It may be a myth, but in Fightville, that's what champions are made of. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>American Reunion tries to use nudity, sex, and fecal matter to generate laughter, but the jokes are tired and predictable.</Review>
            <Review>Yes, American Reunion is a juvenile outing. They steal jet skis and defecate in beer coolers. They cheat on their girlfriends and lie to their best friends. But what did you expect?</Review>
            <Review>Rare is the movie that brings "American Pie" to mind and suffers by comparison, but here we have one.</Review>
            <Review>None of it makes much of an impression, although there are a few nice and surprisingly heartfelt moments around the edges.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Jack MacKenzie (Arquette), once a hot Hollywood composer, has fallen on hard times. Having resorted to taking a draining job as a limo driver just to make ends meet, he is a broken man, trying to put his life back together by picking up the pieces of a shattered family and career. Jack's sprit and sanity have been crushed by the loss of his first daughter and he has turned to alcohol to deal with the grief. Jack catches a break when he is assigned to drive A-List Actor Thomas Bower (Bishop) back-and-forth to the set of his latest film, during which time the two build a friendship of sorts. Bower remembers the score Jack had previously written for a science fiction epic, and appears interested and willing to help him get re-established. Jack also strikes up a sexually charged relationship with Erica Long (Phillips), a model and singer, who is struggling with demons of her own. Battling his repressed memories, depression and addiction, Jack starts to lose control of the one thing he values most - his mind. He must now pull himself together before something goes horribly wrong. However, in the city of dreams...life isn't always at it seems. With powerful performances and thought-provoking themes, Black Limousine will bring to mind the recent critical hit Drive. Here is a beautiful and haunting examination of a man driven to the brink of madness, dreamlike and harrowing; Black Limousine is truly an unforgettable ride.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Cliché, boring, and dull. It's not completely atrocious as you can power through it, but you wouldn't even want to watch it when nothing else was on. Its finale is about as appealing as a pile of dog turds.</Review>

        <Title>Rose Marie</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 1936</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>112</Duration>
        <StoryLine>It was standard operating procedure at MGM to cast their favorite singing team of Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald in new versions of old operettas, then retain only the music, drastically altering the plotlines to conform to popular tastes. This was the treatment afforded the Rudolf Friml-Herbert Stothart-Oscar Hammerstein-Otto Harbach musical Rose Marie--and thank heaven that MGM decided to jettison the original's creaky libretto about a woman who offers her body to the villain to save the hero from a trumped-up murder charge (this chestnut seemed old-fashioned even in 1928, when Joan Crawford starred in the silent version). In lieu of this wearisome storyline, the Eddy-MacDonald version casts MacDonald as a spoiled, temperamental Canadian opera star who learns that her uncontrollable brother (James Stewart), serving a prison sentence, has escaped to a cabin in the North Woods and needs someone to tend his wounds. MacDonald travels to northern Canada incognito, where in a hilarious sequence she tries and fails to pass muster as a dance-hall girl. Upon meeting likeable mountie Nelson Eddy, who unbeknownst to her has been assigned to locate her brother, MacDonald fabricates a story about needing an escort for a rendezvous with her lover. Such latter-day parodies as Dudley Do-Right notwithstanding, the Eddy-MacDonald sequences are often deliberately played for laughs, even when Nelson is uttering such lines as "Heavy? Why, I could carry you for hours!" Gradually, Nelson and MacDonald fall in love, only to fall out of love when Nelson tracks down and captures MacDonald's brother. Despite this rift, a happy--and logical--ending is not long in coming. It might be hard to watch such Eddy-MacDonald duets as "Rose Marie" and "Indian Love Call" with a completely straight face; it is reassuring, however, to find out that the filmmakers knew that "Rose Marie" was ripe for ridicule, and decided to laugh at themselves first in order to disarm the audience. To avoid confusion with the 1955 remake, the 1936 Rose Marie was retitled Indian Love Call for TV showings.</StoryLine>

            <Review>For all its awkwardness and uncertainty, the film is a city symphony, romantic yet scathing, lyrical with street life and vaulting skylines, reckless with first adventure...</Review>

            <Review>Quill is a drama that feels like a documentary . . . or vice versa. And that makes it kind of a strange animal.</Review>

            <Review>[The director] delivers a sentimental tale for dog lovers, grounded by the man-and-his-dog bond that has made the novels Where the Red Fern Grows and Old Yeller perennially popular.</Review>
            <Review>Wonderful, emotionally wrenching charmer is an absolute must-see for dog-lovers of all ages.</Review>
            <Review>Director Yoichi Sai lays the sentimentality and humor on thick at times. Still, the movie is charming more often than not, and Sai's pseudo-documentary approach gives viewers a greater appreciation of service animals.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2009</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>87</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Plenty of professional sports stars have had to overcome adversity to achieve success, but few have had to struggle against the harrowing circumstances that met Kassim "the Dream" Ouma in his childhood. Born in Uganda in 1978, Ouma was one of 13 siblings; he was born into poverty and sent to a boarding school where, at the age of six, he was abducted along with most of his classmates by rebel soldiers under the leadership of Yoweri Museveni. The soldiers taught Ouma how to kill, maim and torture others, and he was forced to inflict punishment under the threat of death. Museveni became Uganda's president in 1986 and Ouma was drafted into the military as soon as he came of age; while a soldier, he began taking boxing lessons. Ouma had a great natural talent as a fighter, and became a star on the army's boxing team. But Ouma dreamed of a better life, and when Uganda's national team traveled to compete in America, he defected, seeking asylum in the United States. Despite having no money and not speaking a word of English, 18-year-old Ouma was welcomed by Africans in the American boxing community, and manager Tom Moran took Ouma under his wing and into his home. Ouma went on to become Light Middleweight champion and a top middleweight contender in a professional career that saw him win 24 of his 29 fights. Filmmaker Kief Davidson tells Ouma's remarkable true story in the documentary Kassim the Dream, in which Ouma talks about his ravaged childhood, coming to America, his return to Uganda, and how boxing became his therapy as he deals with the demons of his past. Kassim the Dream was an official selection at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival.</StoryLine>

            <Review>[An] energetic, if overly worshipful documentary.</Review>
            <Review>Amusing and informative (and hyperbolic) as it is, "All In: The Poker Movie" is a documentary whose intended audience is unclear.</Review>
            <Review>So padded with cheerleading that it doesn't have time for a serious exploration of poker's place in the broader culture or the consequences of its rapid rise and global reach.</Review>
            <Review>Douglas Tirola's pic seems a bit late for the poker craze, and at any rate will be preaching largely to the converted.</Review>
            <Review>"All In" lays down some interesting hands but sometimes can't raise the stakes, though "Rounders" star Matt Damon lends a bit of celeb flash.</Review>
            <Review>Instead of sustaining a significant cultural story, at almost two hours, All In feels like an energetic but overlong highlight reel.</Review>
            <Review>Engrossing documentary on the multi-billion-dollar poker industry gets a little too rhapsodic about the game as a metaphor for life and slips into advocacy for online poker, all while offering a revealing, wide-ranging look at a subculture.</Review>
            <Review>The film has a shambling charm that actively disputes an unspoken notion that a documentary must be well-structured in order to effectively land its points.</Review>
            <Review>Celebrating the worldwide poker renaissance, it's intriguing in the way it delineates another way to chase the American Dream.</Review>
            <Review>An achingly comprehensive poker-praising documentary that unfolds in rather scattershot form, yet still remains more or less entertaining enough to engage non-players.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 1986</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>88</Duration>
        <StoryLine>This modest teen comedy has the usual themes revolving around sex: how to handle it, how to relate to it, and how to do just about everything except engage in it. The focus is on two teenagers, one is the serious Natalie (Jennifer Connelly). She has her eyes set on becoming President of the U.S. and one day heads off to Washington D.C. on a special visit for "Future Leaders." A certain presidential aide brings a romantic touch to her idealized vision. The other teen is Polly Franklin (Maddie Corman) whose infatuation with a baseball player takes her to New York -- where a photographer steps in as a pinch-hitter. A few other subplots move circumstances around in the two teens' lives, though their romantic exploits take center stage. ~ Eleanor Mannikka, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <Title>Billy the Kid</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 1930</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>95</Duration>
        <StoryLine>The tall and virile Johnny Mack Brown portrays the short and dyspeptic outlaw William Bonney, a.k.a. Billy the Kid. Wallace Beery is more effectively cast as Pat Garrett, the sheriff who's sworn to bring in Billy dead or alive despite his grudging friendship for the young killer. Hardly the "homicidal moron" described by western historians, the movie's Billy has a certain amount of charm, though he's shown to be a cold-blooded killer when the opportunity arises. The film's ending was shot twice: One ending retained fidelity to the facts by having Garrett kill Billy, while the other denouement allowed Billy to ride into the sunset, as Garrett beatifically looked on. Over the protests of western purists, the second ending was used in the American release version, though the more tragic climax was seen by European audiences. Billy the Kid was originally released in a 70mm widescreen process called Realife; to avoid confusion with MGM's 1941 Billy the Kid, the earlier film has been retitled The Highwayman Rides for television. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <Title>Back From Eternity</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 1957</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>97</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Director John Farrow's Back From Eternity is a virtual scene-for-scene remake of Farrow's 1939 film Five Came Back. The earlier film is the better of the two, if only because it is 22 minutes shorter. The plot concerns a small passenger plane that crashlands in South America, square in the heart of headhunter country. Pilot Robert Ryan is able to get the plane back into flying condition; unfortunately he discovers that the plane will only be able to carry five of its eleven passengers to safety. Who will have to be left behind: condemned murderer Rod Steiger, socialite Phyllis Kirk, her weak-willed fiance Gene Barry, copilot Keith Andes, elderly married couple Beulah Bondi and Cameron Prud'homme, songstress Anita Ekberg, foul-tempered cop Fred Clark, soft-hearted crook Jesse White, or tousle-haired kid Jon Provost? Rod Steiger is just fine in the role orginally played by Joseph Calleia, but Ekberg is no match for the original's Lucille Ball.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Its mostly observant temper keeps us from being greatly moved, but it holds us with its acute, almost laboratory dissection of its people's beings.</Review>
            <Review>A movie with more plot than it can comfortably handle.</Review>
            <Review>It's all intended to be darkly metaphorical. In actuality, it's a mediocre film unfolding without plan, purpose or enthusiasm.</Review>
            <Review>With a rucksack of gadgets, Dafoe makes a believably cunning tracker, and when he finally confronts his prey, the mutual respect feeds a poignant parable.</Review>
            <Review>Not much happens in "The Hunter." And what little does happen, happens very slowly. And then is repeated.</Review>
            <Review>The character arc is strong on paper but not well-realized on film, and therein lies The Hunter's greatest failing.</Review>
            <Review>It's a character study, for the most part, allowing the complications and relationships to puncture the narrative only when they have finally penetrated the man.</Review>
            <Review>The Hunter is a film of surprising scope and intimacy.</Review>
            <Review>It is an atmospheric and richly rewarding film that glides along at a pace akin to that of the small country local within which it's set.</Review>
            <Review>Slow-moving but graceful, this character study is engaging and insightful.</Review>
            <Review>The Hunter delivers a quiet and somewhat meandering story that wallows in self-importance and social agenda.</Review>

            <Review>It's about a terminally ill man who decides that if he is going to die, he is going to grab a gun and take a whole bunch of obnoxious people with him.</Review>
            <Review>This is no simple wish-fulfillment revenge fantasy. It's an indictment of us as viewers and tacit supporters of the cultural trash heap.</Review>
            <Review>The film features elaborate (and spot-on) parodies of mean-girl reality shows, YouTube nonsense and fatuous news reports but the people are thin and the plot meanders a bit.</Review>
            <Review>This funny, sick twist of social satire is certainly locked and loaded, even if its aim is sometimes off.</Review>
            <Review>The real problem is there's just not enough plot on which to hang the message that mean people suck.</Review>
            <Review>In this "Falling Down" of pop-cultural observation, Goldthwait forgets the thrill of the chase; he's more concerned with piercing verbal barbs than actual suspense.</Review>
            <Review>Goldthwait's bile may be cathartic, but it also feels a bit cheap.</Review>
            <Review>It takes dead aim at the culpability of hate-mongering politicians, the religious right and reality TV stars in making the United States the meanest, rudest country in the world.</Review>
            <Review>A brilliant, fearless, and merciless indictment of American culture, and how we've become the lowest common denominator</Review>
            <Review>Bobcat Goldthwait's God Bless America works well as a black comedy and as a satirical look at pop culture and human behavior.</Review>
            <Review>It's an intriguing satirical idea, and it works very effectively in places, while being tremendously didactic and heavy-handed in others.</Review>

        <StoryLine>This colorful, modern family comedy revolves around 10-year-old boy genius Henry James Herman (Jason Spevack) and his fervently left-wing single mother Patricia (Toni Collette), who works at the local university's cafeteria. A misfit from birth, Henry's precocious, rabble-rousing ways catch up with him when he gets kicked out of school for writing "Manifestos on the Nature of Truth." Meanwhile, 12-year-old Audrey (Samantha Weinstein) has her own problems because of her single father, university professor Dr. Slavkin O'Hara (Michael Sheen), who used her as the test subject for his best-selling book Born Gay or Made that Way? Needless to say, she gets a not-so-nice nickname from her classmates. When Henry scores a scholarship to the university as a child prodigy, the two families cross paths and everything they knew about their lives is thrown to the wind. -- (C) Tribeca Film</StoryLine>

It begins on a relatively light note, as a group of housewives form a recipe club and hold dinners with their husbands, competing with one another to make the most enjoyable casserole. The mood turns more sobering, however, when competition devolves into flirtation and kinkiness that strip bare all social pretenses and threaten to rip the fast friends apart for good.

        <Title>The Secret Diaries Of Miss Anne Lister</Title>
        <ReleaseDate/>
        <Duration>90</Duration>
        <StoryLine>The true story of a woman who boldly lived as she pleased in the 1820s comes to the screen in this historical drama. Anne Lister (Maxine Peake) is a wealthy heiress from West Yorkshire who is nicknamed "Gentleman Jack" by her less charitable neighbors; while Anne is an attractive woman, she often dresses in black, pursues "masculine" hobbies such as shooting, has a keen interest in business and has no interest in marriage, much to the chagrin of her aunt (Gemma Jones) and uncle (Alan David). While Anne is discreet, she prefers the intimate company of women, and she begins a clandestine romance with Marianna (Anna Madeley), another woman from a wealthy family. Anne is heartbroken when Marianna gives in to pressure from her family and weds a rich widower considerably older than herself, but in time Anne finds new love with Ann Walker (Christine Bottomley). However, Anne has a rival for Miss Walker's affections in the spirited Christopher Rawson (Dean Lennox Kelly). The Secret Diaries of Miss Anne Lister was adapted from the true life journals of a British socialite of the early 19th Century; the real Miss Lister wrote her diaries in code, and it wasn't until decades after they were discovered that their full story was revealed. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi</StoryLine>

These ragtags will do everything in their power to make sure you don't go out past your waist. Hughie HighTops (Ben Wells) is a rookie, both as a lifeguard and with the ladies. His best friend, the silver-tongued Otis (Robert Belushi), tries to show him the ropes in both capacities. But Hughie can't help going after Otis' ex, the tomboyish May (Chryssie Whitehead). Not cool, man. So when Maggie (Katie O'Hagan), Hughie's not-so-innocent childhood sweetheart, gives Otis the opening, he doesn't hesitate. Typical riffraff. The hazing by Hughie's faux-militant bosses doesn't help, especially when tragedy hits the beach and he's to blame. Shot on location in Chicago on Super 16mm film. -- (C) Justen Naughton</StoryLine>

        <Duration>84</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Actor Diego Luna stepped behind the camera to direct this warm drama about a young boy whose emotional problems take him in an unexpected direction. Abel is an unstable child whose issues have only gotten worse since his father walked out on the family. No one in the household is sure what to do for Abel or how they should behave around him, and a stay in a mental hospital does little to ground him. However, one day Abel wakes up and decides that he's the man of the house, and begins acting like his absent father rather than the youngest child. To the surprise of everyone, adult responsibilities agree with Abel, and the family seems significantly happier with his new personality. But this proves to be short-lived when Abel's real dad unexpectedly returns, and the two vie for the status of head of the household. Abel received its world premiere at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>Roskam hooks us like a master and leads us where he needs to and wants to - on HIS terms and those that the story demands.</Review>
            <Review>Roskam has created a convoluted but airtight plot involving undercover investigations, betrayals and revenge, it doesn't go in the direction one might expect.</Review>
            <Review>[A] bleak, dense, complex thriller ...</Review>
            <Review>Its centre holds, largely because of Schoenaerts's capacity to elicit our sympathy despite everything.</Review>
            <Review>It's compelling, and Schoenaerts is a treat as this taciturn knot of angst and muscle tone, but Michaël R Roskam's film is short on humanity and dash.</Review>
            <Review>It looks fantastic, boasts an unusual storyline and Schoenaerts is as compelling as a young Marlon Brando.</Review>

        <StoryLine>When the wedding of internationally famous film star Lara Tyler (Alice Eve) to tweedy English author James Arber (David Tennant) is sabotaged by a paparazzo, they decide to relocate the event to the one place where the world's press won't find them: the sleepy Island of Hegg, as featured in James' bestselling novel The Ornithologists Wife. However, dilapidated buildings and greedy islanders are the least of the problems that the wedding party and their Hollywood entourage have to deal with, as Marco (Federico Castelluccio) the ingenious paparazzo tracks them down in his mission to photograph the celebrity wedding of the year. Steve and his assistant Emma (Sally Phillips) must find a decoy bride and think that local girl Katie (Kelly MacDonald) will be an ideal replacement.

            <Review>Instead of working to clarify its high-concept contrivances, the romantic comedy "The Decoy Bride" jettisons logic and detail for silly-quirky rompiness.</Review>
            <Review>A bland romantic comedy in the Richard Curtis style, The Decoy Bride is mainly notable for its proof, if any was needed after Boardwalk Empire, that Kelly Macdonald is a major talent.</Review>
            <Review>Cupid works in strange and sometimes very funny ways, as this charming, nontaxing comedy directed by Sheree Folkson makes clear.</Review>
            <Review>It seems to agree with its gossip journalists that celebrities are an exotic alien species placed on earth to be gawked at, waited on by personal entourages, and mocked behind their backs for their odd enthusiasms and incomprehensible emotions.</Review>
            <Review>Pernicious tripe suitable only for masochists and the intellectually disabled...</Review>
            <Review>The result is less a film, more a bland Britcom box-ticking exercise.</Review>
            <Review>A wretched script and sloppy premise is saved from cinema hell by a charming pair of leads, but still, The Decoy Bride fails to raise anything more than a chuckle.</Review>
            <Review>"The Decoy Bride" doesn't offer anything truly original, but as romantic comedies go it makes for a pleasant enough evening. And if you're like me, the scenery is a bonus.</Review>
            <Review>A woefully pedestrian effort, meant for background noise at a bridal shop, not a feature film that requires the purchase of a ticket.</Review>
            <Review>Possibly the worst thing ever in world history.</Review>
            <Review>It should have been called "I Know Where I'm Gurning".</Review>
            <Review>The Scottish landscapes offer about the only highlight.</Review>

The police however believe that even paying the ransom will not bring Rohan back. It is in this extreme trauma that Sanjana discovers something extraordinary.

        <StoryLine>An ambitious young man from Texas puts his Hollywood dreams on hold in order to rescue his grandmother from a sterile nursing home in this intimate, independent comedy from writer/director Tom Huckabee. It's Christmas, and Ed Franklin (Gabriel Horn) has just returned home to spend the holidays in Texas. Unfortunately for his family, the timing couldn't be worse; Ed's younger has been busted for selling weed, his older brother refuses to let go of a longstanding grudge, and his grandmother has just suffered a debilitating stroke. To make matters worse, Ed's father plans on dropping her off at a local nursing home, and never looking back. Unwilling to stand idly by as his dear grandmother is sent off to die alone and against her will, Ed devises a plan to sneak her out of the assisted living facility, and take her back to L.A. to live with him. Before Ed can get his grandmother across the state line, however, his father catches wind of the plan, loads Ed's brothers in the family car, and sets out in hot pursuit. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>'Mirror, Mirror' is a trippy version of the Snow White story.</Review>
            <Review>Mirror Mirror is a film that's all picture and no propulsion, each scene static in a basic set-decoration color scheme of teabag and banana.</Review>
            <Review>Here, the familiar tale is retold with concessions to feminist self-determination and camp humor, bending the Grimm Brothers' tale without infringing on its basic beauty.</Review>
            <Review>Singh is much more skilled as a visual artist than a storyteller, and his artistic fortunes seem to rise and fall with the inspiration of his screenwriters. In this case he's lucked out.</Review>
            <Review>Who wants to see a fairy tale that weighs a ton? Mirror Mirror reflects badly on everyone involved.</Review>

            <Review>While it may not be as memorable as his other good projects, Singh has delivered a film that should delight audiences of all ages because of the timelessness of the story and the spin the writers have put on it.</Review>

            <Review>The tone is campy and fun, although Roberts is better with the lighthearted dark comedy side of her role. Still, the script is light and witty, poking a lot of fun at itself and the visual artistry is absolutely gorgeous to look at.</Review>

            <Review>It would be ripe territory for self-reflection if this sloppy debut from filmmaker Anne Renton weren't plagued with as much self-doubt and uncertainty as its lead Catholic.</Review>
            <Review>At the most fundamental level, as a work of entertainment, it fails. Scenes meander pointlessly, beginning and ending without any change or story movement.</Review>
            <Review>A moving story of a woman's attempt to keep pace in a world that's moving too quickly for her.</Review>
            <Review>A leaden, ham-fisted affair that was exactly the sort of pap John Waters was spoofing when he cast Turner as a serial-killing soccer mom.</Review>
            <Review>The film's gentle, sentimental approach prevents it from ever really getting at the pain that's been swirling around this imperfect family for years.</Review>
            <Review>"The Perfect Family'' is Kathleen Turner's show. And when a series of crises forces Eileen to re-examine her values and beliefs, Turner rises magnificently to the occasion.</Review>
            <Review>This Kathleen Turner vehicle is a stiff, a picture with so little urgency that it drags on like a sermon without end, with all the flavor of a communion wafer.</Review>
            <Review>Turner is terrific, but The Perfect Family doesn't know quite what to do with her energy, eventually taking on so much surplus woe, there's no chance for a clean exit.</Review>
            <Review>Hollywood generally avoids religion whenever possible. The Perfect Family, a sweet and touching indie comedy-drama, tackles the subject head-on without offending or alienating anyone.</Review>
            <Review>A resolutely middle-of-the-road affair that never locates and communicates a very persuasive reason for its existence, or even a compelling dramatic throughline. A cinematic 'meh' if ever there were one.</Review>
            <Review>Religion butts heads mercilessly with romance in this ironically titled dysfunctional family values dramedy. But the premeditated plot points are simply too blatantly stacked against traditional matrimonial tribes, in favor of idealized same sex unions.</Review>
            <Review>In this dramedy, Kathleen Turner is sincerely sympathetic, as faith triumphs over religion.</Review>

            <Review>Ceylan's own growing reputation will, I hope, continue to grow. He uses the realistic film as an avenue to what lies around and beyond the realism.</Review>
            <Review>It runs 157 minutes, and I can't say you don't feel them. You do - but in the way you would, reading a very good book in an uncomfortable chair.</Review>
            <Review>A movie of such dark, smoldering intensity that it's easy to forget that half of it takes place in near darkness.</Review>
            <Review>A police procedural as existential inquiry, set in a remote dreamscape of mystery and foreboding.</Review>
            <Review>Ceylan's visual style is less heightened, more down-to-earth than the more stylised 'Three Monkeys', but still some of the night-time scenes look like careful paintings, such is the precision of their lighting and composition.</Review>

            <Review>While Gökhan Tiryaki's cinematography is phenomenal, the film is, at its best, a wasted opportunity.</Review>
            <Review>Uma obra encantadora e hipnótica.</Review>
            <Review>This is a very slow-moving movie, but it also has its attractions, such as its beautiful cinematography by Gökhan Tiryaki, particularly the wide angle shots showing the vastness of the Turkish landscape.</Review>
            <Review>The literal "once upon a time" of a series of disillusioned men who no longer think about the future because they obsess over the past.</Review>
            <Review>It's a masterpiece crime story that tells us as much about searching for the truth in modern Turkey as it does about violent criminals and those who prosecute them.</Review>
            <Review>You can't expect a slow burn drama to payoff spectacularly unless it burns slowly, and this is precisely what Turkish auteur Nuri Bilge Ceylan orchestrates in this masterful murder-mystery.</Review>

            <Review>Michel Hazanavicius' black-and-white, mostly silent comedy The Artist is a gorgeously made curiosity -- a film that functions as a testament to its own obsession with other movies.</Review>
            <Review>Through it all, Dujardin has great dignity, is hugely likeable, and pulls off touches of comic poignancy not far from Chaplin's.</Review>
            <Review>The whole thing is so damn clever and charming, it might just sneak off with Best Picture.</Review>
            <Review>It isn't arty or intellectual, though it is artful and ingenious, and it's the rare crowd-pleaser that never feels obvious or pandering.</Review>
            <Review>There is literally nothing wrong with it. I don't have a single nit to pick, minor flaw to point out or little bit that annoyed me. It is pure magic from the first frame to the last.</Review>
            <Review>You can't fault it as smart entertainment, which eschews parody to make a sincere tribute that also serves as cogent current commentary.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director Michel Hazanavicius' The Artist is not for a nanosecond fun-though it works hard to be so. Basically, it is A Star Is Born knockoff.</Review>
            <Review>This is a bauble, not a jewel.</Review>
            <Review>Uplifting, heart-warming, hilarious... not necessarily words you'd expect to apply to a black and white silent French film. But The Artist is no ordinary movie.</Review>
            <Review>Writer/director Michel Hazanavicius uses a shrewd eye for visual composition to tell an emotionally effective story never waylaid by the clever throwback gimmickry of his method.</Review>
            <Review>The Artist is drunk on the history of cinema and art, and culture buffs will get giddy on it.</Review>
            <Review>Retro but totally modern, frivolous yet fundamentally serious, The Artist is a thing of grace and joy and a great American film -- of the sort it takes the French to make.</Review>

            <Review>A sick and twisted horror farce made for a very specific sort of movie geek. I'm one of them.</Review>
            <Review>Father's Day proves that, when he's not making masterworks, (Troma's Lloyd Kaufman is) quite capable of finding fresh examples of same.</Review>
            <Review>A wretched and nonsensical bit of genre drivel...</Review>
            <Review>It's gory, sick, depraved, funny, self-knowingly silly, and entertaining if you're in the right frame of mind.</Review>
            <Review>A triumphantly diseased motion picture, easily the best movie to pop out of Troma Entertainment in quite some time...There's blood, nudity, and violence. Everyone goes home happy.</Review>
            <Review>I'd take it over many of the high-profile attempts at grindhouse horror and it's even more remarkable when one considers that the legendary company gave Astron-6 $10,000 to make it. I'm slightly terrified to think of what they could do with $10 million.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Rajveer Singh is a 21 year old young man dreaming of a professional hockey career. We open with him dreaming of scoring a game winning goal, followed by a moment of bliss as beautiful girls surround him. Unquestionably, he has the talent to be an accomplished player, but faces many hurdles, the biggest of which is himself. Unable to find a foothold in the game, Rajveer takes matters into his own hands by creating an all Indian hockey team (The Speedy Singhs), finding a coach and then bringing on his Uncle Sammy's trucking company as the team sponsor, doing all this behind his father's back. Breakway, full of love, color and fun brings to the life the coming of age of a young man and gives further insight into the immigrant family experience. It brings a clash of Bollywood entertainment to Canada's favorite sport. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>With a script credited to five writers including its star Vinay Virmani, it is a movie that keeps skating madly off in different directions and desperately needs more coaching than director Robert Lieberman provides.</Review>
            <Review>[A] pleasant timewaster, which has a good cast but a not-so-good script.</Review>
            <Review>There are no surprises here, with father-son crisis and reconciliation, scaled-down quasi-Bollywood production numbers and the climactic big game all arriving on cue.</Review>
            <Review>Much better than the other reviews reflect. A feel-good entertainment that sheds light on the misunderstood but heroic Sikh peoples. Now available on Netflix streaming, see for yourself and don't rely on the critics.</Review>
            <Review>The shakiest scenes in Breakaway, a hockey-meets-Bollywood mash-up about skating Sikh-Canadians, occur on the ice. Take that for what you will. The rest of this nimbly-paced but routinely-plotted sports fable is tolerably more entertaining.</Review>

            <Review>For those with a burning curiosity to know how The Lord of the Rings as directed by Michael Bay might look, Wrath of the Titans provides an idea.</Review>
            <Review>What it lacks are the very elements that made the first movie such a surprise: wit and nerve.</Review>
            <Review>This feeble followup to 2010's godawful Clash of the Titans sucketh the mighty big one.</Review>
            <Review>Worthington remains a distinctly humourless hero, which makes you long for the likes of a prime-time Harrison Ford or Arnold Schwarzenegger, who knew how to make a fondue out of cheese.</Review>
            <Review>The father of the gods turned out to be a CGI-created, lava-spewing, mountain-sized creature with smudgy features and all the eloquence of a belch.</Review>
            <Review>A movie in which whole sequences consist of nothing but guys fighting stiff computer images. Such scenes would be boring even were they done well, but these scenes aren't done well.</Review>
            <Review>Movies like this are often called "video game" movies, since they're basically a series of interstitial "story" scenes plopped in to transition to and from the fighting scenes. But this is an insult to video games.</Review>
            <Review>Wrath of the Titans is a welcome improvement but if you didn't like the first film, this sequel is not going to reverse your negative opinion.</Review>
            <Review>...it would seem like [Worthington] was inoculated against charisma as a child.</Review>
            <Review>[I]f you are planning on seeing it, do yourself a favor and stick with good old fashioned 2-D. However, if you want to do yourself a bigger favor, you should just skip it altogether</Review>
            <Review>Admittedly, Wrath of the Titans is a step up from its predecessor but that's not saying a whole lot. It's by no means a good film and unless you really enjoyed the first film, there's no reason you should see this.</Review>
            <Review>In just about every way it makes good on upping the ante from the last film, there's another element that suffers an equal amount.</Review>

            <Review>Filmmakers Ola Simonsson and Johannes Stjärne Nilsson and their engaging cast pull off the feat with no strain and a surprising amount of heart.</Review>
            <Review>"Sound of Noise" is like no heist movie you've ever seen; these bandits want only to transform a city into a canvas for their special brand of aural art.</Review>
            <Review>The energy flags whenever the vandals are at rest, and a romantic subplot feels like an afterthought. But Nilsson is a delight, and the filmmakers' own creativity transforms shock into awe.</Review>
            <Review>Sound of Noise is outside the box, original and inventive. It's also hilarious, and extremely entertaining. The film is one of SFIFF's highlights.</Review>
            <Review>It never achieves much coherence when it tries for more than slapstick comedy.</Review>

            <Review>Follows directly in the footsteps of Bruce Almighty, Click, Liar Liar, Groundhog Day and any other post-Freaky Friday high-concept redemption story that inevitably crossed Tim Allen and Adam Sandler's desks at some point.</Review>
            <Review>What you don't have is a funny movie.</Review>
            <Review>A thousand words? Try two words: stay away. Murphy does a pretty good job keeping up with the various indignities heaped on him but the movie as a whole ends up sinking.</Review>
            <Review>a poorly conceived and startlingly miscast comedy that works to every one of its stars' weaknesses.</Review>
            <Review>You've got one of the funniest verbal actors in the business in Eddie Murphy, and you put him in a movie where he can't talk. It's already a recipe for disaster.</Review>
            <Review>'A Thousand Words' is not unspeakably awful.</Review>
            <Review>The sort of awful formulaic crud that 30 Rock brilliantly mocked just before Leap Day.</Review>

        <Duration>92</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Sidewalls is a clever romantic comedy examining with charm how the architecture of a city conditions the lives of two of its residents. Taretto pays homage to the city of Buenos Aires as he reflects on how urban chaos, as well as new technologies, can unite people but also keep them apart (as the sidewalls of the title). Mixing animation, photography and graphic art he reveals the characters' isolation and anxieties that are a staple of modern life in a noisy city that nonetheless has an irresistible charm. -- (C) IFC</StoryLine>

            <Review>With its themes of alienation in the Internet age and cutesy indie-ish trimmings, the film will feel familiar to anyone who's seen a bittersweet romantic comedy from Sundance.</Review>
            <Review>The preordained story line is clear from the outset, yet Taretto's knack for engineering clever near-misses keeps us guessing about how and when the happy ending will arrive.</Review>
            <Review>It's hard to truly hate any movie whose ending revolves around a clever Where's Waldo? gag. It's also near impossible to take it seriously for that exact same reason.</Review>

            <Review>Smart, wordy and sweetly sympathetic to lives lived online, "Sidewalls" coasts on Martín and Mariana's twin voice-overs, alternate musings on themselves and their city.</Review>
            <Review>A shrewd, intellectually playful rom-com that delivers the gooey goods...</Review>
            <Review>Medianeras may test your tolerance for cuteness, but it's an enchanting modern day fairy-tale cut from the same cloth as 500 Days of Summer and Punch-Drunk Love.</Review>
            <Review>When a film lays all the cards on the table simply to appease the characters' neuroses and insecurities, it becomes self-congratulatory.</Review>
            <Review>Of all of the recent films tipping their hat to Woody Allen's comedies of the 1970s-when he was, you know, funny-Sidewalls is by far the most sentimental and optimistic.</Review>
            <Review>A sweet, slight romance for the Internet age, Gustavo Taretto's debut feature is an appealing if low-key affair, distinguished by some beautifully fluid framing of a built-up Buenos Aires.</Review>

        <StoryLine>On April 22, 2010 the Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling rig run by BP sunk into the Gulf of Mexico creating the worst oil spill in history. Until the oil well was killed on September 19, 779,037,744 liters of crude oil and over 7,000,000 liters of chemical dispersant spread into the sea. By exposing the root causes of the spill filmmakers Josh and Rebecca Tickell uncover a vast network of corruption. The Big Fix is a damning indictment of a system of government led by a powerful and secretive oligarchy that puts the pursuit of profit over all other human and environmental needs. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>Filmed over twenty years by acclaimed documentarian Jennifer Fox, My Reincarnation chronicles the epic story of the high Tibetan Buddhist Master, Ch�gyal Namkhai Norbu, and his western-born son, Yeshi. The film follows Namkhai Norbu's rise to greatness as a Buddhist teacher in the West, while his son, Yeshi, recognized at birth as the reincarnation of a famous spiritual master, breaks away from his father's tradition to embrace the modern world. Can the father convince his son to keep the family's threatened spiritual legacy alive? Never before has a high Tibetan Master allowed such complete access to his private life and it is doubtful that another ever will. -- (C) Long Shot Factory</StoryLine>

            <Review>"My Reincarnation" makes a pretty strong case: when the family business is enlightenment, listen to your dad.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Due primarily to the economic recession, a growing number of people are finding themselves in a position they never imagined: homeless. Nashville, TN is home to a fast rising tent city population. With a shelter system that cannot support even 1 out of 5 of the city's homeless population, most people have nowhere to go. Nearly 100 homeless individuals have come together to form Nashville's Tent City, which is located under a bridge close to the city's center. Tent City, U.S.A. explores this community, which is self-sustained and self-governed. The camp has it's own council, composed of eight camp residents who meet once a week to discuss residents' issues.</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>Anthony always dreamed of being a famous chef. Julian only thought about women. With neither really working out, the childhood best friends decide to start a detective agency. Unfortunately for them, on their first case they must help protect a sexy, high class escort who holds the key evidence to a scandalous cover up. The two bumbling detectives soon find themselves running from the mob, a corrupt US Senator, and a ruthless Mary Poppins-like assassin - all of whom would stop at nothing to hide the truth. It's just an average day for two bumbling losers. -- (c) Lleju</StoryLine>

            <Review>It's easy to feel sucked into some kind of time warp back to the heyday of late-'90s post-Tarantino crime thrillers, cut-rate knockoffs filled with casually cartoonish violence, quippy patter, overtly flash filmmaking and incongruous pop tunes.</Review>
            <Review>If you can't dazzle 'em with brilliance, baffle 'em with genre baloney -- and enough shoplifted visual trickery to fill Quentin Tarantino's kitchen sink.</Review>
            <Review>Though John Stockwell's action comedy is shamelessly derivative, his enthusiastic cast propels it much further than it should go.</Review>
            <Review>An incoherent hybrid of buddy movie, "Girls Gone Wild" episode and James Bond spoof that employs cheap cinematic tricks like multiple split screens for no apparent purpose.</Review>
            <Review>Words like "smug," "derivative," and "shallow" could all be fairly applied to the film, but as a piece of late-night exploitation, it delivers the violence and nudity with the regularity of an IV drip, and some familiar faces in the cast help class it up.</Review>
            <Review>A brazenly efficient and articulate female assassin nearly worthy of a Tarantino or Coen Brothers movie sticks out from amidst the schlocky criminal muck of Cat Run, a self-consciously sleazy comic crime saga composed of facetious elements.</Review>
            <Review>This movie is fiercely uneven, feeling like two different movies got drunk and had a sloppy love child that now no one wants.</Review>
            <Review>A loud, ugly and terrible movie that doesn't skillfully juggle its various elements; it throws them violently at your face and calls it edge.</Review>
            <Review>The nicest thing to be said about Cat Run might be that it doesn't know what kind of movie it wants to become.</Review>
            <Review>An extended trailer masquerading as a feature film</Review>
            <Review>Bullets, babes, perverts, Euro travel, secret documents, hitmen, car bombs, and testicular torture. Oh my.</Review>
            <Review>Made for today it just is more chaotic, has more nudity, and had more violence including some slightly nauseating scenes of torture. Otherwise the film is funny and fun, a fast, entertaining ride.</Review>

        <StoryLine>In a dystopian future, a relentless turf war rages. Two rival gangs feud for control of rural wasteland Frazier Park ('The FP') in the deadly arena of competitive dance-fight video game "Beat-Beat Revelation." After hometown hero BTRO is slain on the dance platform by thug leader L Dubba E, his prot�g� younger brother JTRO (Jason Trost) goes into isolation, vowing never to duel again. One year later, The FP is in ruins, and JTRO must find the courage to return and restore order in a ruthless battle for revenge that can only leave one man dancing. From the producers of Paranormal Activity and featuring narration by James Remar (The Warriors), THE FP is a fury of fierce footwork, triumphant montages and neon street wear that Moviefone calls "a rare ready-made cult hit." -- (C) Drafthouse</StoryLine>

            <Review>Rather than crafting a movie that's so bad it's good, writer-director brothers Jason and Brandon Trost have come up with something that's just plain bad -- and boring, and repetitive.</Review>
            <Review>"The FP" so desperately wants to be cultishly admired for its bad-taste rollout of wacko characters, ugly costumes and vulgar slang that it forgets to be genuinely offbeat or funny.</Review>
            <Review>You need to find a room full of people who get the joke and see this movie there, because audiences will be laughing so hard they'll be screaming.</Review>
            <Review>It falls all over itself to lampoon its midnight-movie forebears even as it borrows their contrivances.</Review>
            <Review>"The FP" works best as an operatic parody of mixed genres with lunacy on the fringes.</Review>
            <Review>Neither obliviously dreadful enough to be "so bad it's good,'' nor intentionally tongue-in-cheek enough to be funny.</Review>
            <Review>The film only embraces the most superficial aspects of the genre. The heart, the soul and the melodrama are all missing.</Review>
            <Review>Given its low budget, it's amazing "The FP" looks as good as it does. The lighting is superb, the sets highlight its post-apocalyptic atmosphere, and the score ridiculous. "The FP" has cult classic written all over it and it knows it.</Review>
            <Review>I missed the train when The FP was first leaving the station, but I'm firmly on-board now...</Review>
            <Review>The FP is a mostly serious, straight-faced spoof of misogynistic gangland B-movies and sports dramas, and rarely does it fail to deliver sparks of originality and sly comedy.</Review>
            <Review>The FP works for its audience, a rowdy crowd of midnight movie fans willing to put up with over-the-top silliness, bad performances, and general lunacy.</Review>

        <Duration>87</Duration>
        <StoryLine>A Bag of Hammers revolves around the friendship of two charming grifters, Ben and Alan, played by Jason Ritter and Jake Sandvig. Ben and Alan have built a successful though larcenous business, posing as car valets, only to steal the vehicles instead of parking them. Because of their less-than-ideal childhoods and a "job" that allows them to remain likeable boyish rogues well into their 20's, their penchant for crime is almost forgivable. However, everything changes when they meet a twelve-year-old boy named Kelsey. Neglected by his mother, Kelsey is drawn to Ben and Alan and they to him--eventually, Kelsey becomes part mascot, part protege. His presence ultimately forces Alan and Ben to choose between a life of crime and fun (an extended childhood) and the opportunity to grow up and deal with the emotional consequences that come with it. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>It's a struggle all the way for A Bag Of Hammers, though its irony-crusted heart is in the right place.</Review>
            <Review>The real scam was the filmmakers tricking Rebecca Hall (and a cameoing Amanda Seyfried) into participating in this blunt instrument of an indie.</Review>
            <Review>Like so many indie flicks, logic takes a back seat while quirkiness takes a Mr. Toad wild ride through the city.</Review>
            <Review>It's not difficult to project that Crano's charming anti-heros, in later life, will be swindling vulnerable little old ladies out of their homes and nest eggs.</Review>
            <Review>Well shot and well acted.</Review>
            <Review>It's hard to say whether A Bag of Hammers is deliberately stylized or simply so lo-fi it inadvertently comes across that way, but the simplicity of its elements works.</Review>
            <Review>May start out sounding like a goofy buddy comedy, but stick with it - and it will surprise you. In a good way.</Review>
            <Review>Suffers from both an odd, ineffective structure and a low-key tone that jars uncomfortably with the subject matter and makes the film's stakes seem unnecessary low.</Review>

It was in these New Hope pews that a young Whitney Elizabeth Houston first showed the vocal range and star quality that would soon make her a legend in the music world. In this film we pay tribute to one of the most gripping rags to riches stories ever told. Whitney Elizabeth Houston first showed the vocal range and star quality that would soon make her a legend in the music world. We talk to those who knew her as ""Nippy"", retrace her steps to stardom and revisit some of her most stunning performances. Whitney Houston was so much more than a performer she was blessing for all who were touched by her gentle soul and kind spirit. She was truly the Greatest Love of All.</StoryLine>

        <ReleaseDate/>
        <Duration>97</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Project X boasts better special effects than usual for tight-fisted producer/director William Castle, but it crumbles in the story department. Christopher George is a secret agent living in the year 2118, who through a complex scientific charade is convinced that he's living in 1968. The plan is for George to uncover a secret germ formula that had been hidden away 50 years earlier. Castle's propensity for borrowing gimmicks from earlier films is well known; this time he reaches back as far as a nearly-forgotten 1954 episode of the TV series Flash Gordon! The biological warfare throughline of Project X was more convincing in its source material, a novel by Leslie P. Davies. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <Title>The Space Children</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 1958</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>69</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Dave Brewster (Adam Williams) arrives to take his new job as an electronics technician at a top-secret Air Force base in California. With him are his wife Anne (Peggy Webber) and their two children, Bud (Mikel Ray) and Ken (Johnny Crawford), who are all apprehensive about this sudden transplant, as well as the spartan existence that all of the families live under. No sooner do they arrive, however, then Bud and Ken see a strange light in the sky pointing to the beach, and soon after that seem to be receiving increasingly powerful -- and detailed -- telepathic communications from an unseen source. The boys are drawn, along with the children from the other families, to a lonely cave near the beach, where an alien presence, in the form of a huge (and ever-growing) brain, has hidden itself. At first, it uses the children to try and persuade the more reasonable of the parents that their project -- a missile called The Thunderer, which will place a hydrogen bomb in orbit, capable of being used on any target in the event the United States is threatened -- is too dangerous to complete. But the parents aren't prepared to listen, either because they don't understand the danger, or because they genuinely believe in the conduct of the Cold War, as in the case of Hank Johnson (Jackie Coogan); or because they're too angry and belligerent, like Joe Gamble (Russell Johnson), who is at a dead-end in his job and has taken to alcoholism and abusing his wife (Jean Engstrom) and stepson (Johnny Washbrook). As the launch approaches and the children's entreaties are ignored, the alien takes more direct action with their help, and they soon find a potential ally in in Dr. Wahrman (Raymond Bailey), the inventor of The Thunderer, who is also the only man on the project smart enough to realize that he may not have all the answers. But the military head of the project (Richard Shannon) is stil prepared to launch The Thunderer, regardless of its inventor's doubts. ~ Bruce Eder, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>This is a film desperately in need of a McLovin. Also, jokes would help. And comedic chemistry between the actors. And an ending that isn't a bolted-on cop-out. Save yourselves. It's too late for me.</Review>
            <Review>The movie has all the heft of a tweet, but Philips has made it look pimp and, until the police end the party, Project X really is a riot.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately, Project X is an example of why gimmicks rarely work, especially once the new shine has worn off.</Review>
            <Review>"Project X" bears a cravenly piggish attitude toward rewarding socially unacceptable behavior that feels unseemly rather than exciting, so-what rather than so-funny and obvious instead of new.</Review>
            <Review>"There's a midget in the oven!" is about as inspired as the dialogue and set pieces get in this queasy-making entertainment about a 17-year-old dude's birthday bacchanalia.</Review>
            <Review>The parent and homeowner in me were appalled by the debauchery and incredible property damage. The teenage boy in me couldn't help but smirk anyway.</Review>
            <Review>Superbad for bullies.</Review>
            <Review>A politically-incorrect and surprisingly uneven teen comedy that 20-somethings will likely enjoy.</Review>
            <Review>PROJECT X is the male gaze substantiated and concentrated into ninety sweaty minutes.</Review>
            <Review>Project X misses the mark some of the time, but makes up for it by hosting the party of the decade.</Review>
            <Review>Unlike prior 'house party' movies, Project X says nothing meaningful about its subject matter and, instead, paints teens as unlikeable and reckless automatons.</Review>

            <Review>There's no reason this cliché-ridden French drama should work, but it does, and there's the beauty of it.</Review>
            <Review>a small charming film that only the French could create.</Review>
            <Review>Casadesus - at 97, a French national treasure who has been wowing stage and screen audiences since the 1930s - tenderly manages to make great literature sound like conversation, and vice versa.</Review>
            <Review>Only the good aspects of traditional village culture concern writer-director Jean Becker, who aims for charm rather than profundity, and hits the bull's-eye with this leisurely film.</Review>

        <Duration>102</Duration>
        <StoryLine>"Mary Pickford, The Muse of the Movies" traces the life and work of this legendary silent film star, movie pioneer, and keen businesswoman. Pickford's life (1892-1979) also parallels an even larger story, telling of the "birth of the cinema" itself. Pickford co-created United Artists Studios, spearheaded the founding of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, as well as established the Motion Picture Retirement Home. Mary, known as "America's Sweetheart" was the first actress to earn one million dollars, and only star to ever receive a 50% profit share of her movies. She was the first actor, male or female, to have her name placed on the Cinema's marquee along with the film's title, and she was the first to win an Oscar for Best Actress in a "sound" motion picture for her performance in the 1929 film "Coquette". In 1976, Mary was presented with her second Academy Award for her humanitarian work.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Soderbergh's editing neatly duplicates Gray's methods, showing us how memory treats the same material at different stages in a life, applying those different coats and shades of lacquer.</Review>
            <Review>This was obviously a labor of love for Soderbergh, and a fitting memorial to the artist.</Review>
            <Review>A brilliantly conceived documentary, one with uncommon respect for -- and understanding of -- its subject's life and art.</Review>
            <Review>This is not a standard bio-documentary. It is the artist giving us a guided tour of himself, through a mosaic of clips from his shows and TV interviews, craftily assembled by Soderbergh.</Review>
            <Review>You're left with as rich a sense of this man as you would in a more typical work of nonfiction. But the film's deceptive, meticulous editing also reveals that Gray's odd ambition met a cultural moment in which it could take root and thrive.</Review>
            <Review>Think of the film as Gray's final monologue.</Review>
            <Review>it's as painful to listen to and watch as it is astonishing that I should feel this kind of connection to someone I never met, and never will.</Review>
            <Review>It's all quite deeply moving, and if you remain untouched by the end credits, you have some self-examination of your own to do.</Review>
            <Review>allows Gray to speak of his life and its significance entirely in his own words without any intrusive talking heads or academic pontification</Review>
            <Review>Soderbergh's creation doesn't fill in any blanks about Gray, and the film is not for the uninitiated, but even ardent fans will have trouble warming up to every detail.</Review>
            <Review>Gray ended his life in January 2004, but director Steven Soderbergh and editor Susan Littenberg have resurrected the beloved actor and monologuist in a sort of performance collage.</Review>

            <Review>A dumb-dumb variant on the Death Wish vigilante justice genre.</Review>
            <Review>[Cage] acquits himself well enough in this otherwise rudimentary thriller from deliriously unsubtle director Roger Donaldson.</Review>
            <Review>It's a perfectly palatable and even engaging thriller, albeit one requiring several leaps of faith and/or disengagement with reality.</Review>
            <Review>Donaldson ... seems to have lost all talent for pacing.</Review>
            <Review>[Cage] shouldn't do any more movies in which his character signals his acceptance of a Faustian bargain by buying two candy bars.</Review>
            <Review>It's refreshing to see Nicolas Cage, non-histrionic and sort of subtle, in a halfway clever piece of indie pulp about a teacher who enlists a cult of vigilantes to kill the man who raped his wife.</Review>
            <Review>Seeking Justice is like mediocre pizza; It won't change the world but it should satisfy those hungry for a well-made, generic meal.</Review>
            <Review>As far as a Cage film goes, Seeking Justice is better than the last couple major theatrical releases that have hit the screens.</Review>
            <Review>Despite growing increasingly preposterous as the minutes tick by, Roger Donaldson's Seeking Justice is still at the high-end of star Nicholas Cage's recent output.</Review>
            <Review>...a hopelessly uneven thriller that just isn't able to live up to its seemingly can't-miss premise...</Review>
            <Review>There is a strange and sometimes wondrous intensity in Cage's performances in these films; sometimes his madness is enough to elevate a film - like Werner Herzog's The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans - to a kind of trashy sublimity.</Review>
            <Review>The movie opens with an embarrassingly obvious scene of exposition and ends in an abandoned mall with a laborious explanation by a talking killer and further villainous actions cleared up by a trusting local detective who can sweep things under the rug.</Review>

        <Duration>93</Duration>
        <StoryLine>After a long absence, gangster and father Ulysses Pick (Jason Patric) arrives home to a house haunted with memories, towing the body of a teenaged girl and a bound and gagged young man. His gang waits inside his house, having shot their way past police. There is friction in the ranks. Ulysses, however, is focused on one thing: journeying through the house, room by room, and reaching his wife Hyacinth (Isabella Rossellini) in her bedroom upstairs. The equilibrium of the house has been disturbed and his odyssey eventually becomes an emotional tour, as the ghostly nooks and crannies of the house reveal more about the mysterious Pick family. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>Still too self-referential, too hermetic and too glacial to offer much enjoyment beyond the gorgeous monochrome visuals.</Review>
            <Review>Patric's performance is a deadpan treat. His can-do, take-charge character is in continual zany contrast to his surreal surroundings.</Review>
            <Review>'Keyhole" is the first Guy Maddin movie that feels as if it got only halfway out of the director's head and onto the screen.</Review>
            <Review>Funny enough to be disarming even when it's spinning its wheels thematically.</Review>
            <Review>A Maddin film has a disturbing way of always seeming to exist in the present, like a dream. You know what happened and you even know what will happen, but you also see it all shifting and changing.</Review>
            <Review>Like Maddin's melancholic and relatively more conventional My Winnipeg, Keyhole is about a memory house, but one that is even more fragmented, mythical and elusive.</Review>
            <Review>A bravura journey into a noirish nightmare world and a lock that even paid-up Maddinites won't be able to pick on a single viewing.</Review>
            <Review>Strangled by its own nostalgic mad love.</Review>
            <Review>Maddin has always been something of an acquired taste - and he seems to be doing his utmost to keep it that way.</Review>
            <Review>This rousing and tormented monochrome tale of a deadbeat gangster making an unusual odyssey through his haunted home is sordid, sinister and bafflingly brilliant.</Review>
            <Review>While it's playfully inventive, it's also aggravatingly elusive</Review>
            <Review>Keyhole is an enchantment of chiaroscuro compositions which float across the screen like a dream; it's an acquired taste but pure cinema nevertheless.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 1945</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>92</Duration>
        <StoryLine>A couple's wartime separation provides an unexpected tonic for their romance in this drama. Robert and Catherine Wilson (Robert Donat and Deborah Kerr) are a married couple whose relationship has hit a dry patch; neither of them have much enthusiasm for each other, and when Robert is drafted into the Royal Navy during the war, they almost welcome the separation. Life in the Navy gives Robert a more easygoing outlook on life, especially after he has a brief fling with Elena (Anne Todd), a nurse who recently lost her husband. On the home front, Catherine makes friends with Dizzy (Glynis Johns), a free spirit who encourages her to smoke, wear makeup, and enjoy a dalliance of her own with a man named Richard (Roland Culver). After the end of the war, Robert and Catherine both dread their reunion, but each find that they're pleasantly surprised with the changes that time has brought to their mate. Perfect Strangers was also released under the highly appropriate title Vacation from Marriage.</StoryLine>

        <Title>The Awakening</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 1980</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>101</Duration>
        <StoryLine>English archaeologist Matthew Corbeck (played by the emphatically-American Charlton Heston) undertakes an expedition to find the tomb of the Egyptian princess Kara, despite his awareness of a nefarious curse that is said to befall anyone who disturbs the tomb. Eighteen years after Corbeck's discovery of the burial site, his teenage daughter (who was born at the very moment of the tomb's violation) begins to behave strangely. Turns out she's been possessed by Kara's malevolent spirit, carrying out the princess's revenge by causing several deaths and developing a less-than-healthy obsession with Daddy. Based very loosely on Bram Stoker's novel The Jewel of Seven Stars (itself the inspiration for Hammer's superior Blood from the Mummy's Tomb), this is basically Warner Brothers' attempt to jump on the big-budget horror bandwagon in the wake of The Omen's staggering success. The result is a good-looking but artistically hollow film -- with elaborate sets, lush cinematography and a sweeping musical score, but little in the way of logic or suspense. ~ Cavett Binion, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>Cleared for takeoff: Flight Angels, an aviation programmer steeped in man-woman attitudes of its time. The story is centered on commercial pilots eager to fly higher (during off-hours they're designing a high-altitude plane) and up-in-the-air attendants eager to land a man (exchanges between the femmes in the Stewardess Lounge are exceptionally catty). Virginia Bruce and Jane Wyman portray two of the title's Angels. Dennis Morgan plays the pilot whose eye problems result in him being grounded by his superintendent (Ralph Bellamy) and sent to the classroom to instruct future flight attendants. He refuses to stay grounded, test-piloting his experimental stratospheric aircraft without authorization.</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>International award winning director David Sington (director of 'In the Shadow of the Moon') tells the story of the credit bubble which caused the financial crisis, which has brought suffering to millions. Forsaking easy explanations of greedy bankers and incompetent regulators, this film goes to the roots of the forces which caused America and the UK to be gripped by the crazy belief that everyone could be rich and property prices would rise for ever. With a cast of bankers, borrowers, brokers and some of the best economic brains in the world, the film tells a gripping story of delusion, deceit and destruction. -- (C) Dartmouth Films</StoryLine>

        <Duration>145</Duration>
        <StoryLine>From acclaimed director Agnieszka Holland, In Darkness is based on a true story. Leopold Socha, a sewer worker and petty thief in Lvov, a Nazi occupied city in Poland, one day encounters a group of Jews trying to escape the liquidation of the ghetto. He hides them for money in the labyrinth of the town's sewers beneath the bustling activity of the city above. What starts out as a straightforward and cynical business arrangement turns into something very unexpected, the unlikely alliance between Socha and the Jews as the enterprise seeps deeper into Socha's conscience. The film is also an extraordinary story of survival as these men, women and children all try to outwit certain death during 14 months of ever increasing and intense danger. -- (C) Sony Pictures Classics</StoryLine>

            <Review>It positively clamours for your attention.</Review>
            <Review>The film is a morally challenging examination of the vexed Polish Catholic-Jewish relations of the era and a rich portrait of a man moving almost reluctantly toward righteousness.</Review>
            <Review>Based on the true story of Leopold Socha, a Catholic Polish sewer worker who hid a group of Jews over a period of 14 months in the underground tunnels of Lvov.</Review>
            <Review>More than half of In Darkness takes place underground, shrouded in rank, oppressive shadows. But the movie also glows bright with life and hope.</Review>
            <Review>The chiseled Furmann gives Mundek a savvy, even moral, brawn. As Paulina, Maria Schrader makes an argument for gentle yet pragmatic maternalism.</Review>
            <Review>Unique among Holocaust films, Agnieszka Holland's Academy Award-nominated In Darkness is set during World War II in a small town in Poland named Lvov (now a part of the Ukraine).</Review>
            <Review>Holland's film is extraordinarily generous with its characters in ways that take the story beyond being a historical fable of altruism and endurance.</Review>
            <Review>Just when you thought you could never watch another drama about surviving the Holocaust, veteran Polish director Agnieszka Holland unearths an astonishing saga from a subterranean past.</Review>

            <Review>The title says it all, really.</Review>
            <Review>The Academy Award-nominated film does not disappoint in terms of performances or presentation, except for its length. A good percentage of its 145 minutes is spent in subterranean near-darkness.</Review>

        <StoryLine>A lonely man finds friendship in the last place he expected in this gentle comedy from writer/director Ed Simpson. A serious man with no friends to speak of, Joel Bixby (John Cariani) moves to a small town and strikes up a friendship with vociferous senior Leo Applegate (Edward Asner). When Leo invites Joel to join a small group of men who regularly gather in a small room to exchange stories, Joel sees it as a good opportunity to come out of his shell. But the more time that Joel spends with the group, the clearer it becomes that he was chosen to fill the space left by a dearly departed member who is deeply missed by his old friends. Regardless, the anxious newcomer gradually gets more comfortable with his new circle of friends, which includes not only fast-food loving Leo but the comfortably feminine Dink (Jack Kehler), spiritually conflicted former cleric Perry (David Wells), and mercurial Nick (Mark Fite), an out-of-work local who's convinced his best days are behind him. Over the course of their regular meetings something incredible happens to reclusive Joel - he finally realizes that even life's biggest problems don't seem quite so bad when you've got friends to fall back on in your time of need. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>A Little Bit of Heaven is a love story set in New Orleans about an irreverent young woman who unexpectedly falls in love with her doctor. Marley Corbett (Kate Hudson) is young, beautiful, and wildly funny, but she's afraid of opening herself up to true love and commitment. Though she uses her humor to prevent matters from getting serious, a life-changing visit to her doctor (Gael Garcia Bernal) sends both of them on an eye-opening adventure of mutual discovery, leading to revelations neither thought possible. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>Sap without the weight of reality, awkwardly combined with a romance without much chemistry.</Review>
            <Review>A little bit of hell.</Review>
            <Review>Kate Hudson dies prettily in this tone-deaf dramedy about a woman finding love while suffering from colon cancer.</Review>
            <Review>When a movie opens with a character telling you that love isn't important, that movie is definitely going to smack down that nonbeliever, because movies always believe love is important.</Review>
            <Review>Who knew dying could be such a laugh riot? Certainly not any of us who have actually watched a loved one in the awful final stages of cancer.</Review>
            <Review>In the long history of bad movies about bad illnesses, "A Little Bit of Heaven" just might be the worst.</Review>
            <Review>While director Nicole Kassall tried to create an independent female lead who doesn't give into stereotypes with Marley, the overall movie ultimately lacked originality, a memorable story and characters with any true purpose.</Review>
            <Review>Director Nicole Kassell is completely out of her element here.</Review>
            <Review>For those who have a lot of time to waste</Review>
            <Review>Bizarre combo of terminal cancer weepy and sexy romcom.</Review>
            <Review>An overdose of sentimentality that ends up being painful to watch.</Review>
            <Review>It's hard to develop much empathy for the characters in the final reel when everything leading to that point rings so emotionally false.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Madison County is about a group of college students that travel to a remote, mountain town called Madison County to interview the author of a tell-all book on the accounts of the grisly murders that happened in the town over two decades ago. Upon their arrival, the author is no where to be found and the townspeople state that they've "not seen him in years." They also deny that Damien Ewell, the notorious murderer, ever existed and that the murders never happened. As the kids start to dig around to get their own answers, they come to find that the stories, and Damien, maybe more real than the townspeople are letting on.</StoryLine>

This self-proclaimed master of spin believes that salesmanship is about selling a story - all he needs is a sucker willing to buy it. He hits pay dirt with a lonely retired farmer (Alan Arkin) who is sitting on something much bigger than an insurance commission. But Mickey's attempt to con the old man spins out of control when a nosy, unstable locksmith (Billy Crudup) with a volatile temper dramatically ups the stakes, trapping him in a madcap spiral of danger, deceit and double-crossing. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>The movie never fully clicks.</Review>
            <Review>As a caustic comedy, "Thin Ice" resides just slightly south of "Fargo."</Review>
            <Review>At one point you're looking at the screen going, "This makes no sense!" Then after a long conclusionary explanation, you shake your head and say, "I'm still not sure that made much sense."</Review>
            <Review>There's nothing like the macabre to bring intrigue to an ordinary life, and nothing like the logistics of body disposal to challenge an insurance salesman.</Review>
            <Review>If only the film were as good as Kinnear.</Review>
            <Review>Thin Ice's troubled production history - the film was famously taken away from director Jill Sprecher and re-edited following its Sundance premiere - can't quite dampen what is, for the most part, an entertaining little comedy/thriller...</Review>
            <Review>The characters are endearingly flawed, the set-up is mischievously appealing and the story is endlessly surprising. The humour is black, the resolution audacious.</Review>
            <Review>In the vein of Fargo and A Simple Plan, Thin Ice is a delicious black crime comedy that melts before our eyes</Review>
            <Review>It builds suspense slowly and surely as things begin to come apart for Kinnear, but it eventually grows tiresome and the twist ending is still a bit hard to swallow.</Review>
            <Review>...the film that has made its way into theaters is no disgrace to any of the names in the credits. Still, it would be very interesting to see the movie that the Sprechers intended to make.</Review>
            <Review>The movie's gently snowbound Midwestern setting blunts some of the story's harsher edges, and the characters mostly feel real.</Review>

            <Review>Whether Cage is still paying off castles, appeasing the IRS, or rebuilding his comic book collection, it's clear he's decided, for now, to trade his talent for cold, hard cash.</Review>
            <Review>Spirit of Vengeance is weighted down for long stretches in the middle, as it starts to treat its own religious hokum plotline with undue seriousness.</Review>
            <Review>Shot in Romania and Turkey, the scenery is terrific and gives you something to watch other than this confusing mess. Johnny Blaze, you're just a candle in the wind, mate.</Review>
            <Review>The film, though, has some redeeming qualities, including the presence of Idris Elba as the obligatory good guy, who encourages Johnny to get Danny into the protective custody of a religious order.</Review>
            <Review>That mix of admirable restraint and unabashed pandering makes Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance a guilty pleasure, if not the most wholesome treat.</Review>
            <Review>It makes me feel cheated and sad.</Review>
            <Review>Nic Cage doesn't get a chance to qualify for the Razzies in this one, which prompts me to recommend you rent Drive Angry instead. That movie has a much better use of a human skull.</Review>
            <Review>A schlocky, derivative, and incredibly ridiculous sequel.</Review>
            <Review>Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is too awful and cheesy to recommend to anyone, even the most diehard superhero fans.</Review>
            <Review>This is destined for a place at the bottom of the pile come the end of the year, but in all honesty, did anyone really expect anything good out of a movie about a guy with a flaming skull going around killing people?</Review>

            <Review>Downey and Law remain this presumptive franchise's draw.</Review>

            <Review>It doesn't take a master of deduction to see that Ritchie has decided to play it too safe with this sequel.</Review>
            <Review>It's all bigger and louder and so much less.</Review>
            <Review>The second installment in the series, churns like a lump of moldy dough sitting in the pit of your stomach, trying ever so hard to be digested.</Review>
            <Review>A welcome return for the World's Greatest Detective Other Than Batman, and a sequel that impressively conspires to be more challenging than its predecessor.</Review>
            <Review>As it stands, with its engrossing-yet-obscured-by-over-the-top-CGI plot, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is little more than elementary, my dear moviegoer.</Review>
            <Review>The truth about this Game of Shadows and its predecessor is that neither has a story worthy of its hero. The story is not only often improbable, it is often simply impossible to follow.</Review>
            <Review>The finale is easily the most capable part of the film, and it does a great job of redeeming much of the earlier portions of the movie.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Inspired by the beloved New York Times bestseller, The Elegance of the Hedgehog, by Muriel Barbery, The Hedgehog is the timely story of Paloma (Garance Le Guillermic) a young girl bent on ending it all on her upcoming twelfth birthday. Using her father's old camcorder to chronicle the hypocrisy she sees in adults, Paloma begins to learn about life from the grumpy building concierge, Ren�e Michel (Josiane Balasko). When Paloma's camera reveals the extensive secret library in Ren�e's back room, and that the often gruff matron reads Tolstoy to her cat, Paloma begins to understand that there are allies to be found beneath the prickliest of exteriors. As the unlikely friendship deepens, Paloma's own coming of age becomes a much less pessimistic prospect. -- (C) NeoClassics Films</StoryLine>

            <Review>Nicely crafted, The Hedgehog seldom aims to be more than a pleasant low-key diversion-at which it succeeds-so it's jolting when the story pulls an abrupt late turn that casts everything in a more serious, ambitious light.</Review>

        <Duration>89</Duration>
        <StoryLine>A hit man with his own way of doing things wonders if the tables are being turned on him in this intelligent thriller from Hong Kong director Soi Cheang. Ho Kwok-fai (Louis Koo) is an unusually talented hired killer known in criminal circles as the Brain. The Brain is a man who can pull off a hit without ever having to pull a gun; instead, he and his cronies (Lam Suet, Feng Tsui-fan and Michelle Ye) stage what he calls "choreographed accidents," in which they arrange for an event to take place that will look like a deadly act of fate to outsiders but is in fact a deliberate murder. The Brain senses there are feelings of anger and mistrust among his crew, and he's placed surveillance equipment in their office space to find out what they're saying when he isn't around. When a client named Wong (Chan Mong-wah) insists upon an especially complex "accident" to claim the life of his father, things don't go as expected; the Brain narrowly escapes death and one of his assistants is killed. Now the Brain has to find out if the hit that went wrong wasn't in fact an "accident" meant to assassinate him. Yi Gnoi (aka Accident) was an official selection at the 2009 Venice International Film Festival.</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>Director Mark Wexler embarks on a worldwide trek to investigate just what it means to grow old and what it could mean to really live forever. But whose advice should he take? Does 94-year-old exercise guru Jack LaLanne have all the answers, or does Buster, a 103-year-old chain-smoking, beer-drinking marathoner? What about futurist Ray Kurzweil, a laughter yoga expert, or an elder porn star? Wexler explores the viewpoints of delightfully unusual characters alongside those of health, fitness and life extension experts in this engaging new documentary, which challenges our notions of youth and aging with comic poignancy. Begun as a study in life-extension, How To Live Forever evolves into a thoughtprovoking examination of what truly gives life meaning. --(c) Variance</StoryLine>

        <Duration>101</Duration>
        <StoryLine>As grunge took off, the music industry was completely transformed in a way nobody expected... especially the young musicians who went from tiny shared Seattle apartments to international superstardom, sometimes overnight. Some handled it well... and some did not. As the acclaimed drummer of Courtney Love's seminal rock band Hole, Patty Schemel was right in the middle of all of it. The openly gay woman who always felt "different" never dreamed she would be part of a multi-platinum selling band, touring with legends, or on the cover of Rolling Stone. Or that, thanks to drug addiction, she could lose it all. Hit So Hard tells the story of Patty's rise to fame (and nearly fatal fall from it), with no punches pulled... and it's one hell of a story. -- (C) Variance</StoryLine>

            <Review>The torturous tale of a remarkable survivor of the grunge era - the troubled but talented drummer for Courtney Love's band, Hole.</Review>
            <Review>Choppy camerawork, sloppy editing, and lack of a coherent narrative structure make for a frustrating viewing experience.</Review>
            <Review>Ebersole pieces things together in a workmanlike way, but the tacky supertitles and camera effects often create a bit of an amateur feel.</Review>
            <Review>Patty Schemel "lived through this." Once you witness what that "this" was, feel free to follow that up with a "wow."</Review>
            <Review>An absorbing, educational, sad, humorous and ultimately uplifting film that is easily accessible and entertaining even for those not familiar with the grunge rock scene, or with the considerable role that Schemel played in that milieu.</Review>
            <Review>Ebersol seems uncertain throughout of what tale he is telling, whether to focus on Schemel specifically or the larger picture of the band and the moments in contemporary rock history they were all witness to.</Review>
            <Review>When the film does (eventually) focus on Schemel herself, it provides a fascinating insight into the pressures of the music business and a cautionary tale of life in the fast lane.</Review>
            <Review>Watching this overlong movie is a painful experience.</Review>
            <Review>While this film documents drummer Patty Schemel's struggle with drug addiction, you can't help but feel that her main role in rock 'n' roll history has been as a first-hand witness to events more important and interesting than her own story.</Review>
            <Review>Hole drummer Patty Schemel's feisty personality infuses this fast-paced film, which not only documents her rollercoaster experiences with drug addition but also provides a lucid exploration of the Seattle grunge scene.</Review>
            <Review>Hit So Hard allows her to look back in candour as she reflects on her career and life ...</Review>
            <Review>There's not enough of the music on view and the film would be a more effective portrait of that era if Ebersole had edited it more effectively.</Review>

            <Review>The need to cram in facts and events makes 'Machine Gun Preacher' feel too much like one large and needlessly glossy montage sequence.</Review>
            <Review>In telling a true story, ambiguity can be an asset; but instead of mapping a middle course, director Marc Foster veers between two kinds of falsehoods.</Review>
            <Review>The clichés fly like so many spent bullet casings...</Review>
            <Review>What looks on the surface to be yet another inspiring story of one man's salvation turns out to be instead both an examination of modern atrocity and a rethinking of the burden/beauty of belief.</Review>
            <Review>Why is it that uplifting movies based on true stories often feel so untrue and fall so flat?</Review>
            <Review>What a surprise. Its grindhouse title notwithstanding, "Machine Gun Preacher" is a genuine drama.</Review>
            <Review>it can be a bit... preachy, if you pardon the pun</Review>
            <Review>With an exploitation-friendly title like Machine Gun Preacher you'd think this movie would be the soul brother of Hobo With A Shotgun. Unfortunately, that is not so.</Review>
            <Review>Despite a competent performance from Butler, Machine Gun Preacher tackles way too much material to present a cohesive onscreen telling of the Sam Childers story.</Review>
            <Review>It's an uncomfortable marriage of sentimental genre conventions and real-life tragedy shown with graphic detail. It does bring you inside the main character's internal struggle, but doesn't seem focused enough as it sways into action film territory.</Review>
            <Review>We're given surprisingly little food for thought when it comes to the question of the complicated tensions between Christian faith and violence.</Review>
            <Review>With all the talk of "Kony/KONY 2012" wending its way into the culture, this movie gives a vivid picture of who this villain is and why the world should be doing something about him.</Review>

            <Review>Brisk, precisely observed, and bracingly non-preachy in its examination of a very tricky subject.</Review>
            <Review>Writer and director Celine Sciamma adorns the thorny dilemma with resonant allusions to gender roles...</Review>
            <Review>Modestly conceived and executed.</Review>
            <Review>"Tomboy" is tender and affectionate.</Review>
            <Review>"Tomboy," a brief and sweetly refreshing French film, is the story of a lie.</Review>
            <Review>Since we are dealing with fresh-faced tweens, we are spared the gender histrionics to be found in the likes of The Crying Game or Boys Don't Cry. Those are indeed bigger films. But sometimes small things can pay off quite nicely.</Review>
            <Review>Far from surprising at any point, Tomboy nonetheless holds one's attention though its sheer force of observation.</Review>
            <Review>The director's low-key approach to such a seemingly complex topic really illuminates the subject in both very basic and rather profound ways.</Review>
            <Review>'Tomboy' makes its points about gender identity and confusion without resorting to cheap laughs or overwrought drama.</Review>
            <Review>This exquisite film is as pure as you can get; it's observational, it's minimalist, there's no intrusive music except where it is part of the action.</Review>
            <Review>Sweet and well observed, the film takes us inside a typical family in a typical Paris suburb - and gives us a spin</Review>

        <StoryLine>A desperate family seeks safety in the countryside after the apocalypse, but finds themselves hunted by a mysterious, seemingly supernatural force. The city is in ruins; most of the population has perished, and it appears as if the government has completely collapsed. In order to ensure the safety of his family, one father gathers as many guns as possible, and raids a convenience store for food and supplies before setting his sights on the country. Though the father's wilderness training provides him with the skills to avoid detection from dangerous scavengers and keep his family well fed, their situation turns grim when mankind becomes the least of their worries. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>'Act of Valor' reeks of military-sanctioned exploitation drama aimed solely at the 'Call of Duty' set.</Review>
            <Review>Fighting is a learned skill; so is acting. And the SEAL stars are plausible only when on maneuvers - performing as their own stunt doubles.</Review>
            <Review>I don't know what to make of Act of Valor. It's like reviewing a recruiting poster.</Review>
            <Review>When the bullets are flying, Act of Valor is undeniably tense and thrilling.</Review>
            <Review>The special ops missions are pretty amazing, but the SEALS as dramatic characters are under-developed.</Review>
            <Review>One wonders how the movie might have played as pure, unceasing battle scenes, allowing the combat to define the characters; with real soldiers doing the onscreen fighting, something special may well have emerged.</Review>
            <Review>'U.S. Navy SEALS in combat are far more than anything Hollywood could ever write,' said co-director Mike McCoy. The real SEALS in 'Act of Valor' demonstrate this to be true.</Review>
            <Review>"Act of Valor" plays out like an extended recruitment commercial.</Review>
            <Review>Act of Valor is a love letter to servicemen but it's also a disjointed mishmash of slick combat sequences paired with awkward performances and a generic storyline.</Review>
            <Review>The SEALs should stick to saving the world, and the movie makers should look at the differences between a movie and a recruitment video.</Review>
            <Review>Although likely to delight patriotic American audiences, it will leave everyone else indifferent.</Review>
            <Review>Would be nothing worth writing about, or even making, without the novelty of seeing some of America's greatest heroes in action.</Review>

        <StoryLine>The opening night film at this year's Critics Week at the Cannes Film Festival, this exuberant and deeply moving film follows a new couple, Romeo (Jeremie Elkaim) and Juliette (Valerie Donzelli), who must face the ultimate test when they discover their new born child is very ill. Gathering their friends and family together, they confront the ordeal together as a form of warfare. Donzelli infuses the story with unexpected verve using a host of cinematic techniques, music and heartbreaking performances that results in a film about a contemporary couple who surprises even themselves with their ability to fight not only for the life of their child, but for each other. -- (C) IFC</StoryLine>

            <Review>True to its title, "Declaration of War" is a visceral, forthright visit to the front lines of battle, where superhuman courage is called for as life-or-death skirmishes turn into a long slog of survival.</Review>
            <Review>The tonal shifts, the "Amelie"-style voiceover and the punk-retro soundtrack may jar some viewers who expect uninterrupted violins, but "Declaration of War" is alternative therapy that really works.</Review>
            <Review>The subject matter is as serious as can be, yet the style is vibrant, energetic and engaging -- often tense, but without a trace of woe-is-me.</Review>
            <Review>"Declaration of War" movingly chronicles a unique and terrible fight: that of two parents against the cancer that has invaded the brain of their 18-month-old son.</Review>
            <Review>As ponderous and overwrought as a film hogged by a couple of young hipsters named Roméo and Juliette can be.</Review>
            <Review>The film may even be too upbeat, especially the ending, which is too easy and contrived. Yet there's real emotion here...</Review>
            <Review>The raddest Lifetime movie you'll ever see.</Review>
            <Review>Touching, balanced and honest, the film imparts a life-affirming message about endurance, love and life's sudden gear shifts.</Review>

            <Review>The underlying drama holds the film together even when self indulgence and the rawness of inexperience weakens the film</Review>

            <Review>While director Espinosa hones in on the ambiguous battle between Weston's idealism and Frost's cynicism, British cinematographer Oliver Wood - who filmed the last two Bourne movies - shoots the hell out of everything.</Review>
            <Review>This is a naive director with so little insight you wonder what comic books he's been reading.</Review>
            <Review>I won't deny that the movie hooked me with sheer brute energy and dragged me along with it most of the way.</Review>
            <Review>Nothing really new here, but the cast is first-rate.</Review>
            <Review>"Safe House" has just enough bone density to emit some satisfying cracks and pops whenever the action gets going.</Review>
            <Review>Everybody fights and everybody lies in a thriller that tries to glamorize spies while demonizing their profession.</Review>
            <Review>With a small amount of tweaking, Safe House could have been a knockout thriller. Instead, we have a film that shares the same notions as my school report cards: ' ...has potential, just needs to focus'.</Review>
            <Review>["Safe House"] becomes a prime example of why no matter how many chases and other action sequences they may throw into the mix, they can't even begin to make up for the more important elements.</Review>
            <Review>Safe House has a cast full of actors who would make any director blush with confidence, but each and every one of them is used as scenery for the action scenes.</Review>
            <Review>It doesn't say much about Safe House that I can only recall a grand total of about 2 minutes, and those are mostly moments that enjoy good quality character time rather than any flash-bang excitement.</Review>
            <Review>Denzel and Reynolds keep the bulk of the film fresh, gritty and intense.</Review>

        <StoryLine>A man looking for a second chance at life crosses paths with a team with practically no chance at all in this comedy. Charlie Jones (Brian Wimmer) is a former major league baseball player whose alcoholism ended his career in center field and ruined his personal life after his wife left him and he ended up in prison following his third drunk driving conviction. As part of his parole, Jones has to serve nearly 200 hours of community service, and while he's eager to coach an amateur team as part of his penalty, no one seems willing to take a chance on him. However, that's before he meets Elliot (Michael Buster), an Orthodox Jew studying to be a rabbi who's trying to salvage the hapless baseball team at his yeshiva school. The team, nicknamed "The Yankles," are desperate enough to try anything, even taking on a pariah like Charlie as their new coach; Charlie soon discovers that these Orthodox theology students aren't necessarily cut out for baseball, but as he and his players et to know one another, he gives them a new measure of skill and confidence, and they help him regain the self-respect he though he'd lost forever. Also starring Bart Johnson, Don Most and Susanne Sutchy, The Yankles was the first feature film from director David R. Brooks.</StoryLine>

            <Review>"American Animal" becomes a philosophically strident evening of speechifying local theater (topic: human evolution).</Review>
            <Review>The film equivalent of being cornered at a house party by someone's coked-out friend of a friend until your ride home is ready to bounce.</Review>
            <Review>It is well-acted and features witty repartee. Look for more good things to come from this talent.</Review>
            <Review>[An] hour and a half of pretentious mind games...</Review>
            <Review>It's best to imagine this movie as a study of three good young actors trapped in an indie film project with a yammering weirdo.</Review>
            <Review>It's hard to tell where D'Elia's own psychotic cinephilia ends and the character's begins.</Review>
            <Review>Self-indulgent indie about a trust-fund kid who thinks he's found the answer to the human experience. Whit Stillman it's not.</Review>
            <Review>It may be baked with the same ingredients that come in your standard mumblecore starter kit, but because of Matt D'Elia's indebtedness to other movies, the film follows a different recipe altogether.</Review>
            <Review>D'Elia's debut feature is, I think, a challenge worth taking. Here, it appears, is a real emerging vision, original, gutsy, and uncompromising.</Review>
            <Review>I think American Animal is an exercise in pure creativity, as in creativity in a vacuum with no consequence of narrative.</Review>
            <Review>American Animal deserves to be seen, but more than that, it deserves to launch D'Elia as a filmmaker of note, and I'm curious to see where he goes from here.</Review>
            <Review>The eloquent, thought-provoking dialog flows at a theatrical pace, but it doesn't feel unnatural.</Review>

When eight cadets are left behind at an isolated military high school, the greatest romantic drama ever written seeps out of the classroom and permeates their lives.

        <StoryLine>While serving a community that relies on her for wisdom and advice (on both personal and ethical issues), Marilyn struggles quietly with decisions about her own future. Furthermore, as she seeks to reconcile the commitments of her profession with a longing for intimacy and love, childhood memories of mental illness and alcoholism come back to the surface - and must be dealt with before she can move forward. As Marilyn's life unfolds in front of the camera (in real time), she shares her journey with remarkable candor, humor and increasing wisdom, ultimately leading her to an unexpected revelation of faith and love in all of its guises. Marilyn Sewell has an undergraduate degree in education and advanced degrees in English literature, social work and ministry. She also has a Ph.D. in Theology and Literature from the Graduate Theological Union and the University of California at Berkeley. Currently living near the Willamette River, in Portland, Oregon, Sewell is working on a new book and continues to blog weekly with her "Reflections," giving a spiritual perspective on issues of the day. -- (C) Kino</StoryLine>

            <Review>Sure, some of the puns and in-jokes sound a little dated, but any movie that strings together lines from Shakespeare merely as a throwaway comic riff is, in my book, a film for the ages.</Review>
            <Review>If the result seems less a coherent story than a two-hour pot high, Submarine is still a breakthrough combination of the feature film and art's intimacy with the unconscious.</Review>
            <Review>Here are all the ingredients of a novel entertainment.</Review>
            <Review>This 1968 Beatles musical gets somewhat plot heavy near the end, but it's a marvel of innocence and free association, blending several animation techniques in a loose narrative full of gentle bad puns and flowing visual segues.</Review>
            <Review>The animation is imaginatively conceived, but stiffly executed.</Review>
            <Review>There's such a wide disparity of graphic styles from sequence to sequence. Some of them, though, still look terrific.</Review>
            <Review>An endlessly inventive picture that blends 1960s psychedelia with such diverse styles as pop art and Art Deco to create the fantastical world of Pepperland and its bizarre inhabitants.</Review>
            <Review>A unique and often brilliant animated film that pictures the Beatles as towering and often god-like gentlemen who have the power to change worlds...</Review>
            <Review>An outrageously inventive piece of eye-popping pop, it still qualifies as one of the greatest animated movies ever made. (It also landed in the number 11 spot on Creative Loafing's own list of The 20 Greatest Rock Films Ever Made.)</Review>
            <Review>Whether it was a case of inspiration or coincidence, most of Yellow Submarine's more creative and graceful visuals are those that complement the songs.</Review>
            <Review>even without the Beatles-endorsed drugs of the time, it's still fascinating to watch</Review>

        <StoryLine>In the tradition of hard-hitting neo-realist filmmaking comes ZERO BRIDGE, the debut feature of Tariq Tapa, a US-born filmmaker of Kashmiri/Jewish-American descent. Having spent his childhood summers in India-controlled Kashmir with his father's family, he was committed to making a film of quotidian life, far from Bollywood fantasies and Western news reports of terrorism: Dilawar is a teenage pickpocket whose escape plans are complicated when he develops an uneasy alliance with a woman (herself fleeing an arranged marriage) whose passport he has stolen. ZERO BRIDGE is a story of two young people's struggle to retain their humanity, despite poverty, the traditional culture into which they've been born, and the fatalism, sexism and casual cruelty of their families. -- (C) Film Forum</StoryLine>

            <Review>[Director Tariq Tapa's] neorealist approach, not supported by much technique, gets dreary, but he has an ace up his sleeve.</Review>
            <Review>The wisp of a story that drives the film follows the neo-realist template a little too closely.</Review>
            <Review>Rough hewn neo-realist drama from India has its sociological fascinations.</Review>
            <Review>Made for a song with a non-pro cast and DV camera gear out of his backpack, Tariq Tapa's debut feature shows the young Kashmiri-American as a filmmaker of enormous promise and precocious maturity.</Review>
            <Review>While the film's minimalist nature is its greatest asset in the first act, it ultimately makes its flaws and screenwriterly touches all the more apparent, resulting in some great individual slice-of-life sequences and some truly hackneyed ones.</Review>
            <Review>Almost effortlessly, the plot of Zero Bridge grabs you.</Review>
            <Review>Despite story elements that don't jive, successfully personalizes new generation's sadly thwarted yearnings for freedom from traditional restrictions in a stymied place.</Review>
            <Review>A winning example of modesty in front of the camera and intelligence behind it.</Review>
            <Review>The fact that Tariq Tapa's Zero Bridge has been forged on such bare, simple terms makes it hard to quibble with the film's more glaring faults</Review>
            <Review>An amazing first film by a 29 year old director/screenwriter/cameraman on location in war-torn Kashmir. Not explicitly a radical film, it has references to this beautiful country's war-related suffering in almost every frame.</Review>
            <Review>The gritty tale, crafted in the social realist tradition, is a raw metaphor touching on the psychology of mass misery in that Indian occupied police state, where even the movie theaters are now expropriated military headquarters.</Review>
            <Review>This excellent debut film provides an insider's view of life in Kashmir.</Review>

        <StoryLine>While John Carter looks terrific and delivers its share of pulpy thrills, it also suffers from uneven pacing and occasionally incomprehensible plotting and characterization.</StoryLine>

            <Review>A mess.</Review>
            <Review>As one of Pixar's star players, Stanton is an experienced cinematic storyteller, which is why it's disappointing that his first live-action project is so unwieldy at times.</Review>
            <Review>The most indelible performance in the film is not, strictly speaking, a performance at all. Rather it is Woola, a six-legged Martian hound who rather resembles a cross between a bulldog and a fetal gila monster.</Review>
            <Review>The reported $250 million price tag for John Carter gives one pause. I suppose one could argue that masterpieces have no price. Then again, John Carter is no masterpiece.</Review>
            <Review>Where John Carter continually gets it right is pacing, levity, and breadth of story.</Review>
            <Review>Whenever the fighting stops and two people have to stand and talk, all the air goes out of everything. Suddenly it feels as if we're in an empty theater, watching a dusty old sword-and-sandal epic.</Review>
            <Review>Even if Edgar Rice Burroughs' 11-volume series is adapted by its three screenwriters into a nonsensical mess, then it should at least be a visual feast, right? Hardly.</Review>
            <Review>This wannabe epic is forgettable, bland and way too long.</Review>
            <Review>They should have just let their freak flag fly and said, "To hell with it, here's 100 minutes of John Carter punching aliens."</Review>
            <Review>"John Carter" is certainly an interesting idea for a film, with a power struggle on an alien world and an outsider affecting the balance, but sadly it never ends up fully working.</Review>
            <Review>If Cecil B. DeMille were alive today and given the chance to direct a special effects-laden fantasy adventure on Mars, he might have made something similar to Andrew Stanton's visually stunning epic "John Carter."</Review>
            <Review>A mightily entertaining, oft-cheesy, oft-soaring spectacle packed with more pulp than Florida's finest fruit.</Review>

        <Title>It's About You</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2012</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>80</Duration>
        <StoryLine>It's About You is a new musical documentary that offers a rare and intimate look at the life and music of Rock and Roll Hall of Famer John Mellencamp. The film premiered at this year's SXSW festival and follows Mellencamp on his summer 2009 concert tour and during the recording of his most recent album, 2010's universally acclaimed No Better Than This, the sessions for which took place at American musical and historical landmarks, including Sun Studios in Memphis and the First African Baptist Church in Savannah, GA. We see Mellencamp recording - with a single mike and mono tape recorder more than half a century old - in the same hotel room where legendary bluesman Robert Johnson created some of his most memorable work. Along the way, Mellencamp reveals an emotional side never before seen by the public, in a film that becomes a soulful, highly personal meditation on his beloved small-town America. -- (C) IFC Center</StoryLine>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>Throughout it all, Markus and his son capture the poetic melancholy of a mostly rural America with an eloquence that recalls the photographs of Robert Frank.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately, Kurt Markus, whose low-key narration punctuates the journey, seems to have learned as much about himself as about his titular subject - while enjoyably enlightening viewers about both.</Review>
            <Review>This is a singularly amateurish and unrevealing documentary, shot on grainy Super 8 film from an all-too-respectful distance.</Review>
            <Review>"It's About You" is an odd and touching little film. I'm glad I stuck it out.</Review>
            <Review>If opportunities arise to explore Mellencamp's process or personality, the Markuses pass.</Review>
            <Review>It's About You's sound is relatively clean and dynamic, but there's nothing remotely resembling a narrative here.</Review>
            <Review>Supplements concerts and recording. . .of Mellencamp's working-class, heartland music . .by making keen observations. . .like Studs Terkel looking at the decline of America.</Review>
            <Review>The result is a kind of homespun video scrapbook, bumpy seams and glue splotches and all; it's flawed, but at least it feels handmade and human.</Review>
            <Review>A striking musical documentary about rock singer and songwriter John Mellencamp and the changes overtaking this musical genre and the heartland of America.</Review>
            <Review>A movie so in love with atmospherics and self-examination that it completely loses track of its subject.</Review>
            <Review>While there aren't many films shot on Super 8 anymore, It's About You doesn't make the case that moviegoing is missing anything because of that.</Review>
            <Review>Luckily, the music trumps the indifferently shot concert footage and lends shape to the evocatively lensed recording sessions in iconic locations.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 1961</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>112</Duration>
        <StoryLine>This combination romance and wartime drama by Etienne Perier was unusual at the time it was released because it portrayed World War II in the Pacific from the perspective of Gwen Terasaki, a woman from the Southern U.S., married to a Japanese diplomat. Based on her autobiography, the interesting story relates how the couple left for Japan after the bombing of Pearl Harbor and remained in Japan throughout the duration of the war. Their experiences and hardships during the war are detailed, as well as the tragedy that separated them once the war was over. Since the suffering of the ordinary Japanese citizen at this time and the racial undercurrents connected to the Pacific war are brought forward, the film stirred some controversy when it was released.</StoryLine>
