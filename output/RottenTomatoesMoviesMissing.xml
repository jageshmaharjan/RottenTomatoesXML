        <Duration>100</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Warcraft has visual thrills to spare, but they -- and director Duncan Jones' distinctive gifts -- are wasted on a sluggish and derivative adaptation of a bestselling game with little evident cinematic value.</StoryLine>

            <Review>A lot of sentimental hogwash about fathers and sons heading off to war.</Review>
            <Review>Warcraft isn't decent. It isn't awful, either, though that would honestly be preferable.</Review>
            <Review>Crowded and scattershot.</Review>
            <Review>Large scale battles and magical pyrotechnics are nice supplements but the absence of well-formed characters and a meaningful narrative render such pretty things moot.</Review>
            <Review>Warcraft is a language you don't speak, a code you can't crack, a party you weren't invited to.</Review>
            <Review>There are plenty of flaws - an overabundance of storylines chief among them, followed by the occasional slip into silly action and/or overdone effects - but what fun to discover some virtues to set against them.</Review>
            <Review>With its stretched narrative, thinly-written characters, and sub-par CGI, Warcraft is an adaptation that's not likely to please long-standing fans of the games or those merely looking for an entertaining fantasy adventure.</Review>
            <Review>An in-one-eye-and-out-the-other spectacle of elaborate and painstaking digital effects in a fantasy medieval milieu: Call it 'Video Game of Thrones.'</Review>
            <Review>If there's one reliable measure of an action movie's script quality, it's the ratio of meetings to run time -- the higher, the duller -- and Warcraft is chock full of tense discussions around maps.</Review>
            <Review>Warcraft goes heavy on the world-building with great production design and a serious focus on action scenes, but ends too ambiguously to make any real impact.</Review>
            <Review>Although the film desperately tries to inject some emotion and gravitas to the proceedings, the CGI-heavy treatment and underdeveloped characters result in a curiously cold end result.</Review>
            <Review>The film as a whole is a real mess. Not that it matters. The Chinese market is going to ensure that we are treated to Warcraft stories for years to come.</Review>

            <Review>It's like riding a roller coaster fueled by Red Bull and grain alcohol: kind of gross but pretty fun, too.</Review>
            <Review>A fine cast goes to waste in this risk-free and clich√©-riddled comedy, loosely based on a true story.</Review>
            <Review>has the jumpy exuberance of a puppy that won't stop humping your leg. It's a bummer that the jokes don't land often enough.</Review>
            <Review>There's nothing clever here. The filmmakers believe that broad, obvious gags, pratfalls, and profanity-laced tirades are inherently funny. They're not.</Review>
            <Review>Doesn't even convincingly craft its own internal reality. There are no rules or character motivations, words come out of Zac Efron's mouth when it isn't moving, and Anna Kendrick's wig changes color seemingly at random.</Review>
            <Review>You never quite believe these women belong with Devine and Efron's Hollywood-generic douche bags -- it feels like a failure of the script, if not the entire industry. If you don't think about it too hard, you won't hate it.</Review>
            <Review>A brash summer film that gets lost at times but its vulgar jokes will definitely make you laugh. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>The longer the film goes on, the more the audience will wonder why they don't feel in on the joke.</Review>
            <Review>If you like films with tasteless humor mixed with parties and alcohol where the characters live happily ever after, then this is the one. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>

            <Review>A movie with poor content. Most of the jokes in it are ridiculous and even absurd. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>

            <Review>Pretentious and self-indulgent, it seems tailor-made to appeal to lovers of the obtuse and inscrutable until it takes a left-turn into schlocky, gore-drenched splatter imagery.</Review>
            <Review>Archly silly, quotable, visually hypnotic and perfectly suited for repeat viewings. On first watch, the film is bizarre, hallucinatory, shockingly gruesome. A second watch unlocks the dumb-clever charms of Refn's script</Review>
            <Review>Refn is hardly the first moviemaker to find a link between supermodels and scary monsters, but he may be the most style-minded one to make the connection. Imagine an issue of Vogue with Maleficent as guest editor.</Review>
            <Review>Things go downhill rapidly as the movie descends into horror material that is laughably grotesque yet so visually cool it remains fatally unfunny.</Review>
            <Review>There's no denying the beauty of Refn's images, even if his puerile instincts are at odds with his obvious pretensions. Those who cry it's shallow and ugly won't be wrong; others will love it for those very reasons.</Review>
            <Review>A bold visionary artist, Refn seems able to revel in the culture of instant gratification while also subjecting it to critique.</Review>
            <Review>Too sophisticated and contained to cause shock, and too naive to function as a fable for the loss of innocence in Hollywood. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Lacks on substantial results but is a film that makes a good point. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director Nicholas Winding Refn is a film-maker who cares deeply about morality, about the clash of right and wrong when an outsider's value system crashes into another, built on the tacit agreement of a larger group.</Review>
            <Review>I think it was a waste of time planning the aesthetics for a very complex and interesting film just to make an irrelevant critique. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>What is it to be consumed? What is to be 'natural'? What power does beauty wield? Whatever the question NWR crafts a sensual and scary metamorphosis, with the elusive power of folk tale.</Review>
            <Review>A twisted view of beauty and body cult of nowadays. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>

            <Review>Lively's melodramatic power remains untapped.</Review>
            <Review>The Shallows is almost a good movie.</Review>
            <Review>You're gonna need a bigger Blake (and you're going to get one) in Lively's enjoyably trashy shark-survival movie, the definition of summer fun.</Review>
            <Review>A splash of fresh seawater in the face of a rather dismal summer movie season. It's very cheesy, which is how escapist summer cinema should be, and part of its charm is that it's not self-reflective enough to be aware of its own cheesiness.</Review>
            <Review>Is "The Shallows" a thriller for the ages? No, but it's decent popcorn fare.</Review>
            <Review>School's out, schlock's in - no lessons here.</Review>
            <Review>A fair and visually beautiful homage to what made us feel scared of going to the beach. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>It bites.</Review>
            <Review>There also isn't a single dull moment, and it leaves us feeling like we've survived a nail-biting brush with one of nature's most deadly predators.</Review>
            <Review>If your heart isn't pounding for most of the film, you're not alive.</Review>
            <Review>This is essentially Blake Lively wearing not much at all versus a special effect. But, it's smartly done, with just enough twists and turns in the tale.</Review>
            <Review>This survival thriller about a surfer precariously trapped just offshore by a predatory shark lacks one essential element: a performance motivated by a genuine lust for life from star Blake Lively.</Review>

            <Review>The window-smashing and car-crashing offer some giddy surprises, but the ridiculous yet bland gunplay is as generic as the setup.</Review>
            <Review>Doesn't have much going for it beyond its leading men, the leading men just might be worth the price of admission.</Review>
            <Review>No one can steal the show from Johnson and Hart. Their dual rhythms, alternately laid back and hyperactive, end up in a glorious and ridiculous kind of syncopation, unicornlike in its rarity and oddness.</Review>
            <Review>With its canned, predictable action sequences and mirthless attempts at humor, it displays an ineptitude that is frankly shocking considering the talent involved.</Review>
            <Review>The film has a firm grasp of Johnson's appeal as a leading man: He is Hollywood's most imposing ray of sunshine.</Review>
            <Review>Central Intelligence won't blow you out of the theater, but you might be surprised at how well it works - how genuinely funny it is - given the familiarity of this concept.</Review>
            <Review>They make a great couple, as Dwayne Johnson's bulk cleverly contrasts with Hart's tightly wound intensity.</Review>
            <Review>Funny as hell, with a sweet message built in, "Central Intelligence" is successful in part thanks to its genius casting, which makes Hart the Bud Abbott-like straight man while Johnson grabs the majority of the laughs.</Review>
            <Review>A hardly effective buddy-movie with moderated humor bits, courtesy of Dwayne Johnson's charisma. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>'Central Intelligence' is Rock-solid.</Review>
            <Review>I laughed hard watching "Central Intelligence" and I believe it's the best movie so far that has been designed around the type of comedy where Kevin Hart belongs</Review>
            <Review>Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart give Central Intelligence all the charisma they can, and through their combined sheer force of will, this comedy works.</Review>

            <Review>"Hunt for the Wilderpeople" is a hoot with heart.</Review>
            <Review>Director Taika Waititi proves expert in his management of tone, such that the farcical elements, however numerous, don't detract from the very real friendship the renegades develop as they elude the world's most dedicated social services officer.</Review>
            <Review>"Hunt for the Wilderpeople" is the kind of adorable, coming-of-age dramedy that Pixar would proudly create if it made live-action movies and not cartoons.</Review>
            <Review>Hunt for the Wilderpeople is all about life-changing moments and the people who are the catalysts. It's about learning from those around you, regardless of age or circumstance.</Review>
            <Review>A lopsided gem full of off-kilter humor, hard truths and real emotion. Great for preteens and up.</Review>
            <Review>There's brilliant chemistry between Dennison and Neil, the pair quite obviously bouncing off each other; a joy to watch on screen, and as the story progresses you begin to feel like a member of their special pack, gleefully part of the adventure.</Review>
            <Review>The film's main asset is an unaffected naturalism, both in the film-making, and in the unpolished characters that we root for.</Review>
            <Review>Hunt for the Wilderpeople has been a huge audience favourite at festivals this year and you can see why, with its brand of dark New Zealand humour, coupled with a boy's own adventure story that goes not merely off the rails, but off-road and off-grid.</Review>
            <Review>It's hard to imagine anybody not being won over by this charming adventure, which I'm already looking forward to watching again.</Review>
            <Review>This charming comedy combines endearing characters with generous helpings of deadpan humour - and the result is quite wonderful.</Review>
            <Review>Hunt for the Wilderpeople is a fun, funny family yarn.</Review>

            <Review>The concept of humankind turning into one enormous mobile hotspot for use by an evil mastermind has legs. It's too bad Cell cuts the idea off at the knees.</Review>
            <Review>Even if it weren't cheap-looking and dreary, "Cell" would still be hobbled by an entertainment landscape already lousy with zombies, and a hive-mind premise that - at least metaphorically - has been all but realized.</Review>
            <Review>Even King's commentary on how cyber-connectivity breeds brainlessness feels shoehorned-in - mostly limited to a few lines from a snooty private-school administrator played by Stacy Keach.</Review>
            <Review>Not a polished work of filmmaking. Some of the nighttime scenes are so poorly lit it's difficult to tell what's happening. The editing is ragged and adds to the confusion. More than a few of the supporting performances are embarrassingly amateurish.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Audrie &amp; Daisy is an urgent real-life drama that examines the ripple effects on families, friends, schools and communities when two underage young women find that sexual crimes against them have been caught on camera. From acclaimed filmmakers Bonni Cohen and Jon Shenk (The Island President, The Rape of Europa), Audrie &amp; Daisy--which made its world premiere at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival--takes a hard look at America's teenagers who are coming of age in this new world of social media bullying, spun wildly out of control.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Audrie &amp; Daisy is a stark portrait of a problem which is not in any way local, aberrant, or random. The problem is systemic.</Review>
            <Review>What the documentary does well ... is critique a culture that allows young men to disregard other people's humanity.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is a sobering look at the minefield teenage girls traverse when it comes to drinking, pressure from porn-addled boys and social media popularity.</Review>
            <Review>This documentary may indeed stir outrage and encourage victims to report such crimes. But it's still a song we've heard before.</Review>
            <Review>This powerful doc chronicles the dismally unjust aftermaths of two recent juvenile sexual-assault cases in the U.S.</Review>
            <Review>The difficult-to-watch yet accessible film painstakingly recounts two high-profile cyberbullying cases.</Review>
            <Review>Painful, unflinching story of rape and bullying.</Review>
            <Review>The documentary scrutinizes the "blame the victim" mentality that has seemingly gotten worse in the internet era. But the film also offers a redemptive message of compassion via a network of survivors.</Review>
            <Review>This is a compelling story, told with tenderness and sensitivity.</Review>
            <Review>Unfortunately, Audrie &amp; Daisy can only show reprehensible behavior rather than break it down. Thankfully, it also shows how women can speak out and be their own advocates.</Review>
            <Review>This film doesn't convey either the tragedy or the responses to it in any way not hidebound by documentary convention.</Review>
            <Review>Feels less like a story than an 95-minute venting of frustrations.</Review>

            <Review>Any discussion of toxic masculinity, or the ways in which brotherhood in all its forms can get twisted, is likely to be muted by second-guessing of the movie's methods.</Review>
            <Review>Though the movie aims for the gravity and psychological horror of Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, the film is essentially the dark flip side of a Seth Rogen comedy ...</Review>
            <Review>A fact-based fratboy movie it might be helpful to think of as Animal House minus the laughs.</Review>
            <Review>The performances are conscientious and earnest; Mr. Jonas has not much to do but come off as callow, with a streak of kindness, and he does so.</Review>
            <Review>With the masterful final shot, Neel wisely leaves the character in a fragile place, uncertain of his next steps.</Review>
            <Review>... explores in convincing detail the legacy of unabated white privilege and sadistic macho posturing that pervades such organizations.</Review>
            <Review>Hearing adorable little Nick Jonas drop the F-bomb over and over just seems to go against God's law.</Review>
            <Review>Like a driver's-ed filmstrip of bloody car wrecks, its scenes of ritualized cruelty, initially grueling, soon blur together.</Review>
            <Review>Effective and jarring, Goat is a tough pill to swallow, but that's the point.</Review>
            <Review>A pretty fantastic character study that really keeps you invested in the story and where it goes.</Review>
            <Review>Goat is a suitably horrific expos√© of campus hazing, but it's wise about the difficulties of ending it, even when victims and perpetrators both want it to stop.</Review>

            <Review>Directors Rob Cannan and Ross Adam have made a picture that's technically rough-edged but absorbing.</Review>
            <Review>The personalities are big, the story is striking, but the treatment is unimaginative-except for the editing, which is often clever and beautiful but problematic.</Review>

            <Review>My Blind Brother puts these characters through the comic wringer, but the humor is founded on the characters and their flaws, not the circumstances.</Review>
            <Review>A thoroughly harmless comedy that spaces its one-liners a bit widely. It's made watchable by an appealing cast ...</Review>
            <Review>Zoe Kazan provides the only compelling moments... yet playing the normal one among such a group of narcissists is a thankless task.</Review>
            <Review>It's a slight film, but one that hits all the tricky emotional and comedic notes without a hint of cruelty.</Review>
            <Review>Though My Blind Brother clearly isn't aiming for the feel-good realm, the emotions never ring true enough to make any of the purposely flawed leads relatable, never mind likable.</Review>
            <Review>My Blind Brother explores this unconventional dynamic with gentle humor and a refreshing amount of sensitivity, brushing up against the more cringe-worthy aspects of its premise without reveling in them.</Review>
            <Review>An enjoyable diversion from the predominantly saccharine [romantic comedies], and one that will elicit more than a few inappropriate giggles from the more twisted fans out there.</Review>
            <Review>My Blind Brother is an effective vehicle for its stars, but it never truly gels as a particularly compelling narrative with something meaningful to say.</Review>
            <Review>The politically incorrect jokes, while often funny, wear a bit thin as director Sophie Goodhart lays them on with naughty glee.</Review>
            <Review>... breaks down taboos with sardonic wit and surprising tenderness, and the result is both mischievous and heartfelt in its examination of sibling rivalry.</Review>
            <Review>Dramedy about adult siblings has language, drinking.</Review>
            <Review>"My Blind Brother" is certainly the best version of this script you'll get thanks to the cast, but it's also a painful viewing experience to see such potential so thoroughly wasted, and such magnetism dulled off.</Review>

            <Review>A bit of self-awareness goes a long way in elevating this comedy sequel above the 2014 original.</Review>
            <Review>There's a lot of empty improv in this Neighbors 2, scenes that have no real direction and no drive; the movie is all digression and shouted exposition.</Review>
            <Review>There are about six really good laughs during the film's 92-minute running length.</Review>
            <Review>The film's hurry to rush through its plethora of characters becomes a strength, because we don't have enough time to get bored by any one scene. The set pieces may be thin, but they show flickers of genuine warmth.</Review>
            <Review>This sequel turns out to be a gross-out comedy with a pro-woman streak (instead of sexy selfies or bro-luring bacchanals, the sorority throws a "feminist icon" party). And it just about works.</Review>
            <Review>A few bits of great physical comedy remain, as when Rogen and Efron get locked in a garage. But they could have been taken from - or slipped into - any movie. They have nothing to do with their characters, or the plot.</Review>
            <Review>It's one thing to create an R-rated soap box which to preach from, yet doing so in such a strong armed and contrived way wins neither applause nor credibility.</Review>
            <Review>Any sequel for a successful movie is a challenge, but comedies seem to have the most difficulty pulling them off. The comedy sequel is rare compared to horror and action movies.</Review>
            <Review>It's the same movie except Rose Byrne and Seth Rogen battle a sorority instead of a frat.</Review>
            <Review>'Neighbors 2' surprises by mixing serious undertones in with the fun-stuff... Talents of Rogen and Byrne up the grade of this comedic follow-up.</Review>
            <Review>Every taboo about the relationship between women and men is used to make an effective punchline. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>What the filmmakers conceived of was, perhaps unwittingly, one of the more feminist statements you may encounter from within an R-rated college comedy, a genre notoriously known for its casual misogyny.</Review>

            <Review>A better film would have muddled the clean white-savior narrative with an actual exploration of what the racial politics of a mixed-race insurgency in the South might have been like.</Review>
            <Review>It certainly looks and sounds right, and probably smells right too -- these gunky Mississippi battles and unwashed soldiers feel authentic. The problem, as with McConaughey's performance, is that you always do feel it.</Review>
            <Review>The director and screenwriter Gary Ross illuminates immense historical spans with the true story of one man's revolt during the Civil War.</Review>
            <Review>Ross bit off more than he can chew... the story lolls and wallows in wartime violence and the rebellion, then rushes through the horrors and trauma of Reconstruction.</Review>
            <Review>A Civil War rebellion becomes an enervating movie by Gary Ross.</Review>
            <Review>As inherently astonishing and powerful as this little-known episode is, it has not been well-served by Ross' lumpy, ill-conceived script, which ends up wasting Matthew McConaughey's terrific lead performance and other strong acting contributions.</Review>
            <Review>As multiplex-bound awards bait, stillness and seriousness just aren't in this film's blood.</Review>
            <Review>McConaughey - having risen from the ashes of many a rubbish romantic comedy in the noughties - here again demonstrates the kind of deeply dug intensity that can elevate a merely average film to greater heights.</Review>
            <Review>The film would have been stronger if Ross had focussed on one aspect of the life of Newton - whose piety is never questioned - instead of trying to cram most of it into feature length.</Review>
            <Review>It sounds the kind of story that should fire the blood and excite great passion but it is workmanlike and too worthy for its own good.</Review>
            <Review>It's a movie that with enormous confidence operates outside the traditional story arc.</Review>
            <Review>McConaughey brings more gravitas and intensity to the role than the role probably deserves. But what he can't bring is complexity, as there is none.</Review>

            <Review>The film feels overlong and a bit repetitious, but it's obviously a complex subject that deserves a thought-out treatment. Maybe a miniseries on public television would be the answer.</Review>
            <Review>A coolheaded survey of a fraught topic. The highly intelligent commentators make for fascinating listening.</Review>
            <Review>Some of this is exhausting and/or repetitious, but a shorter version might lack necessary depth.</Review>
            <Review>At once compassionate and rueful, "Colliding Dreams" is recommended viewing for open minds, and essential viewing for those that remain snapped shut.</Review>
            <Review>"Colliding Dreams" is a film of ideas and a film of history, a thorough and engrossing look at the root causes of the tortured relationship between Israel and the Palestinians.</Review>
            <Review>A calm documentary that seeks to define Zionism, thus presenting a history of the establishment of a Jewish state. Both Israeli and Palestinian voices are heard in this thoughtful effort at moving the conversation forward.</Review>
            <Review>Refreshingly well-balanced, Illuminating, provocative, vital and engaging. You'll never look at Zionism the same way again.</Review>
            <Review>A thought-provoking documentary that reveals the backstory for the present-day occupation of Palestine by Israel.</Review>
            <Review>The filmmakers' perspective is firmly aligned with the views of liberal Zionism, as the leftist peace activists are given the most screen time.</Review>
            <Review>In fact, there is little emphasis on the "Arab dream" and considerably more on the dream of a Jewish homeland.</Review>
            <Review>Colliding Dreams cuts to the heart of the controversy in encyclopedic fashion. Consider it the Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Zionism, But Were Afraid to Ask.</Review>

            <Review>31 is an exercise in frustration for genre-lovers, never living up to its sideshow-gone-gonzo potential.</Review>
            <Review>Deliberately or not, Rob Zombie has created a timely horror movie that riffs on many of the same factors which have given rise to Donald Trump's presidential candidacy.</Review>
            <Review>31 is a horror show delivered in hammer blows.</Review>
            <Review>as is always the case with Zombie's films, it is very difficult to like, engage with or even care about the characters for whom we suspect we are supposed to be rooting.</Review>
            <Review>31 may not be as ambitious as Lords of Salem or as epic as The Devil's Rejects but, by and large, it's a ton of blood-soaked fun that gives us real characters, introduces us to some incredibly twisted assassins and goes for broke at every possible turn.</Review>

            <Review>A film that - from its basic set-up to its dearth of tension - plays like the tedious inverse of Don't Breathe.</Review>
            <Review>The dreary lack of suspense in this tweaked "Rear Window" scenario, and our inability to care one whit for two cruel, arrogant bullies operating under a perceived notion that they're social scientists, makes this one tough going.</Review>
            <Review>There's not much real suspense stirred here by a premise that straddles recent found-footage thrillers and "Rear Window."</Review>
            <Review>James Caan's surprisingly nuanced performance ... does a lot of work in tipping the scales from substandard to mediocre.</Review>
            <Review>Clever and funny, technically excellent caper film, with an amazingly moving emotional payoff at the end.</Review>
            <Review>It's provocative work at times, but also painfully obvious, making for an erratic viewing experience where the urge to tune out is periodically interrupted by engrossing turns of plot.</Review>
            <Review>Bravo for avoiding the typical story beats, but The Good Neighbor forgets to replace them with something substantial.</Review>
            <Review>A good cast, headed by James Caan, and a good premise are wasted on a cumbersome, suspense-killing script and somewhat clumsy direction.</Review>
            <Review>Screenwriters Mark Bianculli and Jeff Richard are too obsessed with driving their freshman thesis home, to the point that they fracture their own storytelling by overstuffing the narrative.</Review>

        <Duration>85</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Ukrainian-born "bad boy of ballet" Sergei Polunin became the Royal Ballet's youngest ever principal dancer at age 19. But two years later - at the height of his success - he walked away from it all, resolving to give up dance entirely. Steven Cantor's Dancer tracks the life of this iconoclastic virtuoso, from his prodigal beginnings in the Ukraine to his awe-inspiring performances in the U.K., Russia, and eventually the U.S., where he went viral after David LaChapelle filmed him dancing to Hozier's "Take Me to Church." Yet beyond celebrating the raw talent and wild ambition of Polunin, whose sights are now set on Hollywood, Dancer considers how wealth and success may not be enough when it comes to finding personal and professional identity.</StoryLine>

As the violence intensifies, The White Helmets follows three volunteer rescue workers as they put everything on the line to save civilians affected by the war, all the while wracked with worry about the safety of their own loved ones. Moving and inspiring, The White Helmets (directed by Academy Award (R)-nominated director Orlando von Einsiedel and producer Joanna Natasegara) is both a snapshot of the harrowing realities of life for ordinary Syrians who remain in the country, and a humbling portrait of the power of the human spirit.</StoryLine>

        <Duration>93</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Most of us perceive that world population is still growing at an alarming rate, with declining births in the developed world being offset by growing populations in the developing world. But are these claims of population explosion mere outdated scaremongering or do they bear some truth? Taking cues from the groundbreaking research of statistics guru, Hans Rosling, Misconception offers a fascinating glimpse at how the world is tackling these population shifts. Following three distinct stories, director Jessica Yu grapples with the way in which macro population trends affect the individual. As all three subjects point to the continued failure of top-down policy making to serve the best interests of their populations, Misconception forges an insight into this highly charged political issue, on a human level, to reveal how we are all ultimately striving for the same goal.</StoryLine>

        <Duration>84</Duration>
        <StoryLine>A Nebraskan family reunion couldn't seem more backwards to a gay Californian teenager. If Ryder had his way, he'd choose a moment just like this to come out, the bigger the scene the better. For his mother's sake however, Ryder agrees to keep quiet, save parading around the picnic in his most audacious pair of short-shorts. Ryder's antics raise dubious eyebrows from his hardened cowboy relatives, but 9-year-old Molly can't get enough. She follows her cool California cousin everywhere. After lunch, they walk to the barn to look for a bird's nest in the rafters. Their strange encounter, and whatever happened while the two escaped their family's watchful eyes, makes Ryder the sudden target of suspicion, and places him at the center of a long buried family secret. Anchored by a breakthrough performance by Logan Miller as Ryder and rich, dramatic turns by Robin Weigert and Josh Hamilton, TAKE ME TO THE RIVER constantly forces one to question any given character's culpability until the film's finale. The film, woven together by an omnipresent sense of dread, is the masterful debut from writer/director Matt Sobel.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Matt Sobel transforms a nightmare he once had into an evocative, original drama.</Review>
            <Review>Is it me, or is the big climactic reveal not really worth all the hubbub?</Review>
            <Review>Sobel evokes more terror from a shot of a field of sunflowers, or a weathered barn, than can be found in the last dozen found-footage films combined.</Review>
            <Review>Sobel is clearly trying to hit on something more original than a family-secrets drama, but in doing so, he pulls most of his punches.</Review>
            <Review>The movie pivots from what I expected it to be: a family drama about an outsider, as the opening conversation suggests. Instead, it becomes an eerie mood piece about secrets buried deep in a family's fabric.</Review>
            <Review>The menace never becomes palpable, whether because of illogical plot lines or questionable casting. The stakes are so high, but the suspense never rises to the occasion.</Review>
            <Review>All-too-familiar familial battleground, well-known from decades of low-budget indie drama.</Review>
            <Review>You'll have to see for yourself what a slender plot line, well-chosen parts, and skillful directing can achieve with a handful of rich characters and a deceptively peaceful setting.</Review>
            <Review>Yet another dysfunctional family drama indie film, writer-director Matt Sobel's Take Me to the River has its flaws. But on the whole, this is an impressive feature debut.</Review>
            <Review>You admire Sobel's tenacity, even if his reach exceeds his grasp.</Review>
            <Review>Take Me to the River is Picnic at Hanging Rock-level cagey about its central mysteries, and while many of its characters know what happened off-screen in both the recent and distant past, they ain't sharing the details with us, just their pain.</Review>

            <Review>Using a lot of real-life West End of Cincinnati dancers and athletes in the cast lends the film an authentic feel without ever feeling amateurish, and the specificity of Toni's story resonates outward.</Review>
            <Review>[Holmer] and cinematographer Paul Yee infuse the community center, in and around which the entire film takes place, with elements of magical realism to accentuate the protagonist's passage from childhood into adolescence.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is a nearly perfect thing, made with such assurance that every shot holds weight and widens your heart.</Review>
            <Review>It's a curious world that Toni is entering, and Hightower's quiet watchfulness takes it all in.</Review>
            <Review>Like its lead Royalty Hightower, whose performance is just as spectacular as her name, The Fits is impossible to look away from. It's gorgeous, poetic, and opaque, and I've never seen any other movie like it.</Review>
            <Review>"The Fits" and its electrifying young star give getting in formation renewed meaning, with inspiring, self-assured verve.</Review>
            <Review>The film envelopes you in its spellbinding narrative.</Review>
            <Review>Anna Rose Holmer's strange but beautifully crafted film is worth seeking out.</Review>
            <Review>...a captivating, mesmerising, and remarkably painful journey into adolescence and independence.</Review>
            <Review>...captures approaching adolescence for what it really is: an out-of-body experience.</Review>
            <Review>[Holmer's] given us something almost otherworldly, using the phenomenon of mass hysteria as a stepping stone into adolescence. That her film uses little dialogue, instead expressing emotion through movement, makes it that more remarkable.</Review>
            <Review>I like a lot of things about The Fits, and the first thing that got me was the way it sounds.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>It's a bank-robbery thriller and a "political" expos√© all at once: No wonder this overly elaborate potboiler turns into a muddle.</Review>
            <Review>It's pulp, but it has real actors doing real acting in a gritty story -- which is a lot more than can be said for some of the much more high-profile buddy cop movies of the last couple of years.</Review>
            <Review>One assumes that every film has a creative impetus at some point in its production, but it's incredibly hard to find one buried underneath this morally vile, incompetently made thriller.</Review>
            <Review>Willis' workaholism benefits "Marauders," an otherwise plain action picture carried by strong performances and a mildly compelling mystery.</Review>
            <Review>"Marauders" lays out a scenario in the first 40 minutes or so that, oddly enough, makes you think "this is not an entirely uninteresting premise for a thriller." But after that, things devolve ...</Review>
            <Review>A hyper-convoluted heist movie that's every bit as generic as its title might suggest.</Review>
            <Review>It is hard to care when the entire thing feels like a tired rehash of stock elements. And, no, adding Bruce Willis' smirk and a perfunctory twist at the end does not help matters.</Review>
            <Review>Bruce Willis sleepwalks his way through yet another generic role in Steven C. Miller's Marauders; a muddled and a painfully formulaic actioner which fails to offer anything even remotely original.</Review>
            <Review>There is just too much -- too many characters, conniving, and convolution -- to keep track of, and in the end, so little of it really seems to matter.</Review>
            <Review>As B-grade movies go, this is pretty much par for the course - the plot is an excuse to show choreographed mayhem and that is what director Miller has concentrated on.</Review>
            <Review>It's tough for anything of note to happen in the movie when every character is dedicated to explaining everything on screen. And yet, somehow, nothing is clear or, in the end, all that interesting.</Review>
            <Review>Marauders is not a monumental effort by any means, but some solid acting saves a fledgling script that tries to be a million different thrillers at once.</Review>

            <Review>[Wan's] framing of the scares is artfully managed, and it is the accomplished Wolfe, rather than any monster, who takes true possession of the tale.</Review>
            <Review>You always get the sense that the Hodgsons are being targeted by something that is truly out of their control, and that's the biggest scare of all.</Review>
            <Review>There are only so many times a slamming door will get an audience to jump.</Review>
            <Review>A supernatural winner bound to make some noise at the box office and worthy of loud applause.</Review>
            <Review>Much longer, more elaborate, more dramatic, and more packed with chilling moments and hair-raising visuals than one could anticipate, even from Wan.</Review>
            <Review>The Conjuring 2 might very well be the best horror movie we've seen from James Wan yet, marking a confident return to horror for the director who has repeatedly changed the genre time and time again throughout his career.</Review>

            <Review>The fact that a Marvel movie dares to question the big, shiny spectacle that is its bread and butter - and acknowledge that untold thousands die in the name of entertainment - seems rather novel.</Review>
            <Review>The motto of the directors, Anthony and Joe Russo, appears to be: If you can make it happen, do it. Don't hold back.</Review>
            <Review>As they did in Winter Soldier, the Russos have achieved an uncommon balance of plot and action, humor and drama, all of it once again deeply grounded in character.</Review>
            <Review>It's the Vibranium standard for super-team flicks.</Review>
            <Review>Civil War reminds us it's OK to enjoy a few laughs, even while diabolical villains plot doom, outraged citizens demand accountability and your best pal mistrusts you.</Review>
            <Review>In the end this is a movie about friendships and conflict, and what can happen when the latter overwhelms the former. It's about two genuine heroes who can't reconcile their obligations and duties with the friendship they both cherish.</Review>
            <Review>Its many ideas, plot-points and characters are expertly conceived, written and portrayed to make for a roller coaster of a superhero movie.</Review>
            <Review>The real key to Captain America: Civil War is its sense of inevitability, and its acceptance that sometimes things change-they change big.</Review>
            <Review>Despite the name on the marquee and the content of the advertising campaign, this is very much a film about Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.).</Review>
            <Review>Captain America: Civil War is good, but too stuffed to be great.</Review>
            <Review>Marvel has seriously outdone themselves once again. Civil War is a near-flawless cinematic experience that neatly packages one of the most pivotal story lines in comic book history.</Review>
            <Review>Captain America: Civil War is fun; it's too well made, acted and scripted for it to be anything less.</Review>

As Roger tries to take a stand amidst outrageous fishing excursions, propulsive water jetpacks and American history-themed musicals, he realizes that being a part of a new family may be more difficult than he'd thought. From Lorne Michaels, the executive producer of Saturday Night Live, comes a hilarious comedy co-starring Rita Wilson, Bill Pullman, Ellen Bloodworth, Sarah Burns, Giancarlo Esposito, Rachael Harris, Kumail Nanjiani, Kenan Thompson and David Wain.</StoryLine>

            <Review>The film is a fascinating look at the culture's legacy of incarceration, addiction and recidivism, captured without interviews or narrative exposition. It simply and directly shows us things that deserve our attention.</Review>
            <Review>Riccobono creates a credible panorama of modern small-town America.</Review>
            <Review>By tackling the larger issue of Native American gangs through the story of two northwest Minnesota drug dealers, Riccobono personalizes a problem that deserves more attention.</Review>
            <Review>Riccobono's film is a powerful example of cinema's ability to grant even the diciest of characters their full humanity.</Review>
            <Review>The betrayal of Native Americans by larger forces looms over this powerful movie without ever being explicitly discussed.</Review>
            <Review>Riccobono films it all with intelligence, sensitivity and a feel for offhand poetry; his camera captures moments of intimacy and tension without ever quite intruding.</Review>
            <Review>There are no teary-eyed breakdowns or moments of grand revelation in The Seventh Fire, just an utter lack of hope for a better future.</Review>
            <Review>The film is intimate and personal and enlightening - I highly recommend it.</Review>
            <Review>Uplifting it isn't, but there's poetry to be found in these desperate lives, and Riccobono never judges or sensationalises his subjects. Sensitive, if slightly unfocused.</Review>
            <Review>A startling debut feature that proves Riccobono knows how pose challenging questions and face stark realities.</Review>
            <Review>An achingly grim look at career-criminal culture flourishing in a vacuum of opportunities.</Review>

            <Review>With all the ranting about a "rigged" financial system, the movie certainly captures the zeitgeist, but it' so overloaded with action-movie tropes and tech-based plot contrivances that it begins to feel a little silly.</Review>
            <Review>No matter how many times Jack O'Connell waves his gun in the air and threatens to detonate the place with a bomb, you never truly believe anyone's life is in danger.</Review>
            <Review>A bewilderingly facile and preposterously plotted misfire that offers few pleasures as either a star-driven thriller or a big-screen indictment of the forces that devastated global bank accounts.</Review>
            <Review>The pieces would seem to be in place, but ... "Money Monster" is a stodgy, moribund plodder loaded with stock characters that wouldn't have felt edgy in 1983 and has about the same contemporary urgency as your average late-night rerun of "CSI: NY."</Review>
            <Review>Investing in this movie would not be a safe bet.</Review>
            <Review>With a tense narrative, an excellent ensemble, and impressive direction from Jodie Foster, Money Monster is a compelling and exciting thriller that grabs you from the start and hardly slows down until the very end.</Review>
            <Review>Entertaining, mature thriller has language, violence, sex.</Review>
            <Review>It's not perfect but it's definitely a must-see.</Review>
            <Review>Far from the painfully earnest snorer that the first trailer ... promised, Money Monster is surprisingly funny, impressively acted, competently shot, and remarkably efficient.</Review>
            <Review>A suspenseful thriller with a good dose of social criticism that's effective enough to be entertaining and smart at the same time. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>There's a great moment near the end where she literally turns the camera on the audience itself, breaking the fourth wall in a way that is eerie and striking.</Review>

            <Review>... provides plenty of rewarding moments and clever twists that effuse its central mystery with some emotional relevance.</Review>
            <Review>With some reservations, A Bigger Splash is an entertaining exercise and certainly worth seeing.</Review>
            <Review>A loose remake of a 1969 French movie, this mature, fascinating character drama is alive in a very sensual way, zeroing in on atmosphere and environment and the way they react with humans.</Review>
            <Review>The mesmerizing photography and ecstatic personality of A Bigger Splash will leave you tipsy, so please, bring a designated driver for this one.</Review>

            <Review>Most of the movie is poking bulls, blaring rodeo announcers, time spent in the back of the truck as the bulls are moved from point A to point B. Not exactly riveting stuff ...</Review>
            <Review>With all the grace and symmetry of a peacock fanning its tail, director Gabriel Mascaro reveals his hand in quixotic blasts of expressionistic color, graphic sensuality, and a few things we've never before seen on film...</Review>
            <Review>The cowboy character would have benefited from a stronger story arc, but Cazarr√© is quietly charismatic in the role, a Brando-esque figure searching for meaning beyond maschismo.</Review>
            <Review>Mascaro works much like his protagonist, gathering together details, images, and scenes to create unexpected visions. The narrative seems desultory and repetitive until it coalesces into some arresting, if not perverse, sequences.</Review>
            <Review>Visually ravishing and sexually provocative, Neon Bull offers an unforgettable portrait of a changing Brazil, at once earthy and arty.</Review>
            <Review>The film is filthy with nuanced moments of fierce, sweaty intimacy, all shot with a precise eye for detail. At the very least, it will make you rethink your next rodeo.</Review>
            <Review>Every frame aims to be a visual poem and the film sums up in sweaty sensuality. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Poverty and tradition are combined in a elusive story about rodeo life in northeastern Brazil. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Relationships and what could be seen as traditional gender roles ripple as fluidly as the muscles on a bull's back, as Mascaro immerses us in Iremar's world.</Review>
            <Review>A succession of voluptuary visuals in its sketched-in scenes and dabs of poetic fancy, with humans, with animals and with humans who dance wearing a mask of a horse's head.</Review>
            <Review>Brazilian filmmaker Gabriel Mascaro's Neon Bull finds grim economic commentary in the lives of a handful of people who work in a rodeo, tending bulls that are roped by flashy riders in the ring.</Review>
            <Review>Bull is David Cronenberg's Crash set in the world of Brazilian rodeo - not just in the way that both the bipeds and the cattle live in cramped conditions, but also the sheer amount of sex and nudity that occur in very close proximity to the animals.</Review>

            <Review>There are elements of The Hand That Rocks the Cradle here, but Mr. Farr and an excellent cast of four give it fluidity and balance without the familiar "gotcha."</Review>
            <Review>The Ones Below demonstrates true artistry, with sharp dialogue and the actors to carry it, a perfect pleasure for those who want to dwell in their deepest fears.</Review>
            <Review>Even as events turn more than a tad preposterous with twists that seem not just predictable but inevitable, Farr keeps a handle on the tension and tone, which keeps us hooked.</Review>
            <Review>There's much to admire in the thriller "The Ones Below."</Review>
            <Review>Capably delivering on its ominous title, "The Ones Below" is a masterfully calibrated psychological thriller that deviously plays off of anxieties surrounding contemporary notions of domesticity and identity.</Review>
            <Review>There's plenty to enjoy in the film, starting with a pair of affecting performances by Cl√©mence Po√©sy and Laura Birn, and ending with a perverse twist on the notion of blissful parenthood.</Review>
            <Review>"The Ones Below" cannot attest to having the most original of plots. It is an effective film, however, one that ever more tightens its compellingly diabolical grip.</Review>
            <Review>Dull and programmatic in equal measure, The Ones Below seeks to thrill with its Polanski-tinged pregnancy drama but mostly ends up insulting its audience's intelligence with an obvious endgame and cheap stabs at paranoid dread.</Review>
            <Review>Supremely chilling and effectively slow-burn.</Review>
            <Review>This suburban nightmare is a testament to the horror of implication, drawing on the vicious politeness of middle-class aggression rather than blood and gore.</Review>
            <Review>Lots of thriller potential here, but out-of-character actions interfere with suspension of disbelief.</Review>
            <Review>The Ones Below is a powerful thriller, a movie that toys with audience expectation at every turn, making it the type of debut Farr will be proud to lead off his resume with long into the foreseeable future.</Review>

        <StoryLine>A sweet but insecure girl tries to make the most of her biggest romantic opportunity - if only she can fight off the undead closing in on her! ... in the delirious NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEB. Directed by Kyle Rankin, winner of HBO's Project Greenlight (Season 2), the "disarmingly sweet horror comedy"(Starburst) will charm its way onto Blu-ray, DVD and digital platforms from MPI Home Video on September 6, 2016. After a girls' night out, endearingly awkward Deb wakes up in the apartment of the most attractive guy in Portland, Maine. She's thrilled, but can't remember much about what actually got her there. Pretty boy Ryan, who's engaged to be married, only knows her presence is a mistake and he ushers her quickly out the door - right into a full-scale zombie apocalypse! Now, a walk of shame becomes a fight for survival as the mismatched pair must team up to survive. They make their way to Ryan's rich dad's mansion, hoping to lie low until the zombies disperse. But family fights may be just as dangerous and unsettling! Ultimately, Deb realizes that the only thing scarier than trusting someone with your life is trusting them with your heart.</StoryLine>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>You admire the look and the performances, and some interesting ideas are presented, but everything feels muted and predictable and lacking in spark.</Review>
            <Review>As stiff and rigid as two equals signs, "Equals" is a bland sci-fi romance that is as dull as its scrubbed-clean visual aesthetic.</Review>
            <Review>The DVD box should warn prospective buyers that its contents could cause drowsiness.</Review>
            <Review>Doremus and screenwriter Nathan Parker ... borrow from "Romeo and Juliet," "1984" and every sci-fi flick ever made about a society that suppresses feelings. The movie's futurism is nothing new.</Review>
            <Review>The final resolution of the plot is actually rather intriguing, but the journey to it is so slow and predictable that most moviegoers will have long since lost interest.</Review>
            <Review>This is a heartfelt film, often brilliantly directed, but quite thin in terms of vision.</Review>
            <Review>To his credit, Doremus is a subtle director, who prefers exploring human feeling to mechanical action.</Review>
            <Review>A bromidic cautionary tale scavenged from the frozen ashes of the Cold War. It's message? Love each other, don't blow each other up. Well, duh.</Review>
            <Review>Too closely resembles the narcotic world it depicts. Without ever doing anything conspicuously wrong, Equals plays like one big miscalculation...</Review>
            <Review>Flimsy, futuristic repression isn't much fun....</Review>
            <Review>Doremus treats the threadbare story with a turgid solemnity that does neither the script's pedestrian ideas nor its attractive stars any favors.</Review>
            <Review>Despite some powerful character-driven moments, the deliberately paced result is more pretentious than provocative as it maintains a frustrating emotional distance.</Review>

            <Review>You root for Marnie, even when it's clear why Lori struggles with her, and you hear her persistent voice in your head for a while afterward - reminding you, perhaps, to give your own mother a call.</Review>
            <Review>The beauty of The Meddler is in its insistence that grief passes - even if you can't buy your way to happiness.</Review>
            <Review>Sarandon sparkles in this lightweight comedy-drama.</Review>
            <Review>Talent is squandered by writer/director Scafaria's penchant for shallow contrivance over emotional depth.</Review>
            <Review>The Meddler feels more like a sitcom than a feature film, with a mix of drama and comedy that wraps up neatly. But with tidiness comes charm and poignancy.</Review>
            <Review>Uplifting fluff drama on an over-protective but a well-meaning mother.</Review>
            <Review>Arriving under the radar, The Meddler is a surprise treat. Go see it with your mother.</Review>
            <Review>The film isn't perfect and there are a few clich√©s but tonally it feels very true, and there are laughs and sniffs that make it an enjoyable night out.</Review>
            <Review>Subplots are set up and abandoned, while every potentially comic scenario is exploited in the broadest, most groan-worthy way imaginable.</Review>
            <Review>The Meddler isn't especially funny, but it is charming and quietly moving, and it's the sort of film that will make you want to call your mum.</Review>

When Garza arrives, he is shocked to find that the infamous accountant is a 17 year old American computer hacker named VIC (Joey Morgan).

            <Review>Not nearly as smart as it should be.</Review>
            <Review>"Genius" deals with the creative ego, its trappings and the need everyone has for an editor.</Review>
            <Review>Well-written, gorgeously shot, and expertly edited, the film is also an exasperating exercise in good intentions gone wrong.</Review>
            <Review>Perhaps the best advertisement for Genius -- not only did it make me want to revisit Berg's book, it had me lining up the Wolfe, Fitzgerald and Hemingway on the e-book runway.</Review>
            <Review>Firth and Law falter with their characters' awkward bromance: the former a fatherly cipher (will he ever take off that fedora?); the latter a clatter of drunken scribe clich√©s.</Review>
            <Review>An intriguing study of the personalities and torturous process behind some of the early 20th century's great writing.</Review>
            <Review>Law's Wolfe is a solipsistic blowhard and Firth's Perkins has the patience of a saint, when what one wishes happened was that he had delivered a swift kick to the writer's pants and sent him packing.</Review>
            <Review>Genius ends up being terrifically boring, while enthusiastically reproducing the creative hierarchies of the time it portrays.</Review>
            <Review>This is that rare bromance movie in which the lads are less connected via women and drugs than by their intense, cerebral pursuits.</Review>
            <Review>The biographical Genius is uneven, and that imbalanced focus-the same thing that novelist Thomas Wolfe needed help with all those years ago-is its weakest element.</Review>
            <Review>Documenting the inner life of creative artists and their world is challenging at best... 'Genius' manages to capture the grandiose dreams of both infamous writer, Wolfe, and his long-fabled editor...</Review>
            <Review>Too often literal rather than literary, stagey rather than cinematic, Genius can't live up to its title, and ultimately its good intentions are undone by mediocre instincts.</Review>

            <Review>Love &amp; Friendship is Jane Austen with the romance drained out, exposing the pragmatism and the economic urgency underneath. That sounds grim, but the result is actually a tart, fizzy delight from Metropolitan director Whit Stillman.</Review>
            <Review>Adapted with great warmth and wit ...</Review>
            <Review>Stillman doesn't upend the Austen formula, he burrows into it and embraces all its trappings. The snappy dialogue, meanwhile, rewards a finely tuned ear and will thrill all lovers of language.</Review>
            <Review>Love &amp; Friendship is quick, clever and delightful, very funny and hugely entertaining.</Review>
            <Review>A delightful comic romp that fans of the classic English author will love.</Review>
            <Review>Following many staid and treacly Austen adaptations, this sublime period romp adds a thrilling splash of bemused, acidic humor.</Review>
            <Review>This adaptation of Jane Austen's novel is a brilliant film about female manipulation. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>More of a piece with Stillman's other films than with such Austen adaptations as Sense and Sensibility and Emma.</Review>
            <Review>Whit Stillman's Love &amp; Friendship is a strangely misguided attempt at bringing Jane Austen's novella "Lady Susan" to the big screen.</Review>
            <Review>This is a delightful, entertaining comedy filled with wonderful dialogue.</Review>
            <Review>...has about it something of the feel of a screwball comedy. There's a bit of Preston Sturges in the film, and while the dialogue is set in period vocabulary, it's delivered in a way that feels quite modern.</Review>
            <Review>Whit Stillman said that his primary filmic influence for Love &amp; Friendship was the Steve Martin and Michael Caine slice of genius Dirty Rotten Scoundrels. Scoundrels would be proud to see the result of his love and friendship.</Review>

            <Review>But very little about this hollow sequel to 2013's heist thriller Now You See Me feels mysterious; its biggest set-pieces will make viewers ask not "Whoa, how'd they do that?" but "Wait, huh?"</Review>
            <Review>The movie offers neither the astonishment of the magicians' artistry nor a dramatic view of how they do it.</Review>
            <Review>Based solely on merit, Now You See Me 2 is a sequel that should never have been made.</Review>
            <Review>And of course, there's no danger of mistaking computer-enhanced trickery for actual sleight of hand, so even the modest but honest pleasure provided by quality card work is compromised.</Review>
            <Review>The film is mainly horseplay, wasted motion, and talk, talk, talk, with a few good action scenes ...</Review>
            <Review>Just as cheerfully outlandish as the caper flick's precursor, with the acceptance of fancy tricks and misdirection twists dependent on an audience's love of a good hoodwink.</Review>
            <Review>Those who dismissed Now You See Me as "dumb" will most likely label Now You See Me 2 as "dumber," as it features the same types of narrative strokes that made that unexpected hit such a dopey undertaking.</Review>

            <Review>Alex Simmons' debut feature is a fleet, consistently amusing 80-minute jaunt through the woods.</Review>
            <Review>This first feature by TV documentary director Alex Simmons, about a weeklong, male-bonding hiking trip, hasn't packed enough plot or humor to distinguish itself amidst all that lush mountain greenery.</Review>
            <Review>Everyone should have a friend like Flula (Flula Borg), a ridiculously optimistic German musician hiking with his American friend David (David Giuntoli) through the wilds of Oregon in the frequently funny "Buddymoon."</Review>
            <Review>Fairly harmless and innocuous, but also only as funny as your tolerance for the overuse of Borg's idiotic shenanigans.</Review>

            <Review>The film's truly a two-man show and both [David] Giuntoli and [Flula] Borg play their parts perfectly.</Review>

When Casper attempts to break into Hollywood, Frank follows him to Los Angeles, seeing an opportunity to salvage their strained relationship. As the guys come face-to-face with a number of LA's denizens-including Isla Fisher, Adam Levine and "Game of Thrones'" star Nikolaj Coster-Waldau-it's clear that they're equally ready and willing to take on Hollywood...but is Hollywood prepared for Casper and Frank? A reunion with Klown director Mikkel NÔøΩrgaard, Klown Forever sees the series, best described as "Curb Your Enthusiasm" as directed by Lars von Trier, reach ingenious new heights--and stoop to gut-wrenchingly hilarious lows.</StoryLine>

            <Review>"Kickboxer: Vengeance" isn't going to raise anyone's SAT score, but it's passable in the realms of kickboxing cinema and will hold your attention during late-night cable viewing.</Review>
            <Review>Alas, the film's testosterone cocktail curdles at the end of Kurt and Tong Po's bloody climactic bout.</Review>
            <Review>While Moussi has ample skills as a fighter - and is plenty handsome to boot - he lacks Van Damme's charisma.</Review>
            <Review>None of it ... comes within spitting distance of the original's highs, like its dance sequence, so awkwardly staged and poorly directed that it actually becomes charming.</Review>
            <Review>This reboot smartly doesn't try to escalate the material to bigger and better status, keeping things small and scrappy and relying on the fighters to be the best special effects.</Review>
            <Review>"Vengeance" is well-crafted good fun - and good proof that you don't need more than two hours or $100 million to give ticket buyers their money's worth in popcorn thrills.</Review>
            <Review>This lean, unpretentious entertainment delivers everything one might want from a film titled Kickboxer: Vengeance - including, at the last, an homage to the younger Van Damme's disco-dancing prowess.</Review>
            <Review>It's good for a laugh, but not much else.</Review>
            <Review>Kickboxer: Vengeance is a glossy update of the original Kickboxer; but gloss doesn't mean better. Give me a more realistically formidable bad guy and a drunken JVCD bar fight any day of the week.</Review>
            <Review>Works best, if at all, as an exercise in nostalgia for those who look back fondly on the kind of mindless B-movie action schlock that Cannon specialized in during the seventies and eighties.</Review>

            <Review>By the time its evolution is complete, The Jungle Book has proven itself a minor Darwinian miracle, perhaps the oddest of all species: a movie nearly devoid of human beings, yet one bursting with humanity.</Review>
            <Review>Most of the real world challenges that Leo DiCaprio faced in The Revenant, 10-year-old Neel Sethi faces plenty persuasively in The Jungle Book's digitized world.</Review>
            <Review>The computer-generated effects are extraordinary; the jungle and its menagerie of beasts and critters looks positively lifelike.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is an odd beast: A powerful exploration of the cruelty of nature in which the animals occasionally break into song.</Review>
            <Review>Considering the amount of VFX heavy duds released at a constant rate, The Jungle Book is a triumph of its kind.</Review>
            <Review>A beautifully-told coming of age tale with sublime visuals, aided by some of the best 3D seen since Gravity and Avatar.</Review>
            <Review>Jon Favreau returns to the kid-friendly films he made earlier in his career (Elf and Zathura) and finds he still has a gift for breezy, good-looking, beautifully-paced, and well-told stories.</Review>
            <Review>A lavish rehash of the 1967 Disney classic that takes computer-generated fakery to new heights.</Review>
            <Review>Disney pushes forward with its live-action remakes of animated classics with The Jungle Book, a visual marvel.</Review>
            <Review>Favreau's take on The Jungle Book is a revelation certain to thrill audiences for many decades to come.</Review>

        <Duration>95</Duration>
        <StoryLine>CITIZEN SOLDIER is a dramatic feature film, told from the point of view of a group of Soldiers in the Oklahoma Army National Guard's 45th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, known since World War II as the "Thunderbirds." Set in one of the most dangerous parts of Afghanistan at the height of the surge, it is a heart-pounding, heartfelt grunts' eye-view of the war. A modern day Band of Brothers, Citizen Soldier tells the true story of a group of young Soldiers and their life-changing tour of duty in Afghanistan, offering an excruciatingly personal look into modern warfare, brotherhood, and patriotism. Using real footage from multiple cameras, including helmet cams, these Citizen Soldiers give the audience an intimate view into the chaos and horrors of combat and, in the process, display their bravery and valor under the most hellish of conditions</StoryLine>

            <Review>Where other good war docs have done more of the storytelling retrospectively, the directors here bounce around in-the-moment POV angles to keep us in the action.</Review>
            <Review>Through the incorporation of multiple strategically placed cameras, including helmet cams, the filmmakers, who achieved a similar, grunts-eye-view in 2014's "The Hornet's Nest," create an undeniably palpable experience.</Review>
            <Review>The tension in "Citizen Soldier" is enough to make you gnaw through your fingernails.</Review>
            <Review>For want of a better term, this gives you a "first-person shooter" look at actual war: It's Call of Duty with no cheats or respawns, and real-world consequences.</Review>
            <Review>A promising but half-realized documentary whose relentlessly upbeat and on-message tone is more akin to a recruiting video.</Review>
            <Review>It's well edited to create a film that tells the soldiers' story well, and for that, many small sins can be forgiven.</Review>

            <Review>Isn't that romantic? No, it's really not.</Review>
            <Review>Fans of the best-selling novel by Jojo Moyes will be heartened to hear that she wrote the screenplay, too, and that she has preserved all the lines that - when read aloud - will provide much mirth at your next dinner party.</Review>
            <Review>Such a wonderfully uncynical movie that it almost doesn't matter that it isn't very good.</Review>
            <Review>It's not perfect - there are times when the pacing is off and the epilogue tries too hard to end things on a positive note - but it's effective and affecting.</Review>
            <Review>The only real acting in this movie comes from Janet McTeer and Charles Dance as Will's aggrieved parents. They bring some ballast to this blubberfest.</Review>
            <Review>Bring a tissue to this intelligent weeper.</Review>
            <Review>Me Before You has no interest in the realities of life with disability; it is, rather, yet another variant on a threadbare formula.</Review>
            <Review>One of those pretty films that fans of the genre will love. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>In other words, if you've ever wanted your romance with a side of disability and chronic pain, Me Before You is perfect for you - as long as you don't actually want a realistic depiction of any of those things.</Review>
            <Review>Despite offering a relatively engaging storyline, [Me Before You] might as well have been another Nicholas Sparks-inspired sob-fest, thanks to its inescapably sugary and formulaic structure.</Review>
            <Review>Me Before You presents itself as classier than its genre, but it fundamentally delivers an imbalanced central relationship that comes off as quite sexist.</Review>

            <Review>Despite her script's omissions - we learn little about where these affluent people come from, their occupations or how they know one another - Ms. DuVall juggles the emotional dynamics with fluid editing and light comic touches.</Review>
            <Review>The script wobbles between heavy-handed and touching, but the result is a pleasantly nostalgic throwback that's saved from its copy-cat tendencies by charismatic actors.</Review>
            <Review>If DuVall's purpose was to provide a snapshot of her generation, she should have sharpened her focus.</Review>

            <Review>It's more engrossing to just hang out with the characters in all their damaged glory, before the plot marches through the room with its clunkiest boots on.</Review>
            <Review>These are characters we've generally seen before and don't care to revisit.</Review>
            <Review>DuVall doesn't just fall back on ad-libbing quip-flingers; her cinemascope frames are precise and assured, and she knows how to cut on a joke without making it seem over-determined.</Review>
            <Review>A competently-shot, well-acted -- especially from Lynskey -- slice of thirty-something ennui.</Review>

On Mr. Norman's 65th birthday in 2000, Disney HR forced Floyd to retire. Refusing to leave his "home," Floyd has "hijacked" a cubicle at Disney Publishing, unpaid, for the past 16 years, picking up freelance work when he can. At 81 he continues to have an impact as both an artist and a mentor. Mr. Norman plans to "die at the drawing board."</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>In one desperate night, four disparate gay men cruise Philadelphia in pursuit of ever-elusive human connection. Brian, a poet with an already-spent advance and a looming deadline, seeks distraction at dusk-whether that means a hook-up (or two) or confessing his love to his straight best friend. Drew, a renowned sculptor in love with his boyish muse, is eager to finish his latest creation. His model Jim is an unpredictable aspiring actor prone to dramatic outbursts. Simultaneously aroused and intimidated by Drew's talent and devotion, Jim yearns for a modicum of freedom from the sculptor's attentions. Rounding out the quartet is Bob, a wealthy, alcoholic talent agent, cruising the Philadelphia backstreets for a "beautiful something." Despite his aimlessness, he usually finds his target.</StoryLine>

            <Review>When one of the most enlightening moments of a film comes during the postscript (black holes!), you know there's a problem - one that has nothing to do with math.</Review>
            <Review>[It] takes an incredible true story - about an impoverished Indian man whose Jedi math skills helped him triumph over race, class and bad food in early 20th century England - and telescopes it into a well-made yet predictable tale of inspiration.</Review>
            <Review>The multiplexes are full of films that promise little more than a forgettable good time. "The Man Who Knew Infinity" is just as entertaining, but far more substantial.</Review>
            <Review>It's predictable - throughout the film, I kept thinking that I'd seen it before - and a bit sentimental, yet thoroughly pleasant.</Review>
            <Review>The Man Who Knew Infinity stands on its own merit, thanks in great measure to Patel and Irons, who give us two engaging characters.</Review>
            <Review>It touches on serious - and ridiculously complex - ideas but always cuts them down to manageable, middle-brow morsels.</Review>

            <Review>It blooms with moments of astonishing beauty: a yellow frenzy of springtime trees; a still room where the light slants in the window like a reaching hand; a desolate landscape, impossibly green.</Review>
            <Review>Like Davies' best work, the movie employs classical rigor - perfectly symmetrical, painterly landscapes and interiors - with unexpected postmodern touches.</Review>
            <Review>"Sunset Song" is not without flaws, but it's an art film of uncommon beauty.</Review>
            <Review>It's an absorbing, finely composed, fretful film. But when it's over, there is as much relief for the filmgoer as appreciation for the filmmaker's art.</Review>
            <Review>Davies tries things nobody else would try. Here that means allowing the choral passages - scenes in which individual characters and groups of characters express their feelings in popular ballads or folk songs - plenty of room.</Review>
            <Review>Has its moments of grace, but too often resorts to conventions and a tone of high lugubriousness.</Review>
            <Review>It has taken Terence Davies 18 years to bring Sunset Song to the screen, but it was worth it.</Review>
            <Review>After what can only be described as an audaciously bleak opening act, Sunset Song makes a gentle, sweeping turn towards greener pastures on behalf of its redoubtable heroine.</Review>
            <Review>The structure can be episodic at times but the strength of Sunset Song is in its cumulative power. It reveals a soulful outlook that, like the cherished land, endures.</Review>
            <Review>...contains characteristic moments of great beauty...</Review>
            <Review>Davies is in no hurry to tell this intimate story, and he handles it with his customary sensitivity, confirming his status as one of Britain's finest contemporary directors.</Review>
            <Review>So lovingly does cinematographer Michael McDonough's camera track the rural landscape that it's just as true to say that Davies's film is about Scotland itself, and about the intrinsic link between the land and the people born to it.</Review>

            <Review>Maggie's plan may or may not work out. But as a smart, perceptive commentary on modern times, "Maggie's Plan" succeeds beautifully.</Review>
            <Review>Something between Shakespeare, Woody Allen and Noah Baumbach, a cautionary tale filled with Manhattanite wit and small moments that have the ring of truth.</Review>
            <Review>The comedy is in the performances, not the scattershot storytelling.</Review>
            <Review>Many have compared Maggie's Plan to earlier works by Woody Allen, though I was reminded more of the output of Noah Baumbach -- at any rate, either comparison works.</Review>
            <Review>Moore packs the performance with so much insight that Georgette becomes the real star of the story, the centre of the triangle with Maggie and John revolving around her.</Review>

            <Review>Elyse Steinberg and Josh Kriegman's documentary may well be the ultimate political experience, capturing in excruciating detail the hopeful comeback and disastrous second defeat of former US Congressman Anthony Weiner.</Review>
            <Review>A true "fly on the wall" documentary, "Weiner" gives the viewer almost unfettered access to the man and his campaign.</Review>
            <Review>Yet simply to obsess over Weiner's personal failings is to miss a bigger tragedy...how politics and the media have come to collide and collude, and the deleterious-disastrous impact that has had on the world the rest of us have to inhabit.</Review>

            <Review>...the unjustified downfall of the movie's subject ultimately elevates Weiner above the level of a run-of-the-mill political portrait.</Review>
            <Review>This territory might look parochial to an international audience, but Weiner (winner of the top doc award at this year's Sundance) is a tragicomic entertainment illuminating a number of current trends.</Review>

            <Review>It comes apart about halfway through, losing a very difficult tonal balance. Having said that, there's more to like here than the studio burial would have you believe.</Review>
            <Review>"Clown" has the goods. Refreshingly dark and sick, this is a movie for those who like cinematic monsters that hit so hard they leave a mark.</Review>
            <Review>With Clown, Jon Watts has crafted a genuinely creepy and disturbing body horror experience unlike anything I've ever seen before.</Review>
            <Review>A lot of the gore feels just downright mean spirited, especially when children become the primary targets.</Review>
            <Review>[Blu-ray Review] Classy and icky, atmospheric and chilling, "Clown" astutely plays into the unknown mystique coulrophobia is made of. Highly recommended.</Review>
            <Review>While clowns are scary to many, filmmakers Christopher Ford and Jon Watts give the white-faced subject matter behind this loathsome horror movie only a cursory exploration; the result isn't much fun.</Review>
            <Review>... features an intriguing premise and some unsettling weirdness, yet many of the plot twists feel arbitrary and the suspense seems dialed back in favor of obligatory gore.</Review>
            <Review>Clown struggles to balance seedy horror moments and B-Movie laughs, which makes for a tonally ambiguous watch that's too serious for comfort.</Review>
            <Review>The premise is ridiculous, but very little fun is had with the notion of a regular suburban dad unable to shed his embarrassing attire</Review>
            <Review>Watts shows early signs of style, but there's clearly a reason why his first film was buried for years.</Review>
            <Review>Jon Watts does nothing with the scarily funny notion of a respectable professional who suddenly refuses to shuck a party costume.</Review>

            <Review>In addition to the generic science-fiction backgrounds, the characters all look to have been sculpted from the same brightly coloured dough. They have bounce but not much personality; it's the Megan Fox of animation.</Review>

            <Review>For those attuned to its amiably sleazy vibe and sudden alternations between violence and slapstick, it offers a guiltily pleasurable way to pass an evening.</Review>
            <Review>The Nice Guys has a nice feel: just slick enough to keep from falling apart, just brutal enough to keep from seeming inconsequential.</Review>
            <Review>Why see this film? Partly because of the leading men, but mainly because of a girl.</Review>
            <Review>It has the byzantine plot of an L.A. noir, but races through it with the breathless energy of Black's other work.</Review>
            <Review>You won't see Captain America and Iron Man squaring off at an airport, but you do get Russell Crowe breaking Ryan Gosling's arm and then cheerfully downing a Yoo-hoo.</Review>
            <Review>It's all delightfully fizzy, bloody fun - even if there's the teeniest, tiniest hint of sequel ambitions.</Review>
            <Review>Outrageously funny from start to finish...The two leads play off each other perfectly.</Review>
            <Review>With his third stint as director, Black has found his niche in evoking great performances, and framing engrossing and entertaining stories. The conclusion of The Nice Guys hints at a sequel. Please let it happen.</Review>
            <Review>The Nice Guys is a glorious mess of a movie.</Review>
            <Review>A refreshing film due to its excessive violence and hilarious originality. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Shane Black's The Nice Guys is a splendid tribute to mystery films of the 70s, featuring a good dose of black humor and surprisingly great chemistry between leads Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling.</Review>
            <Review>Too often, The Nice Guys feels like the Funniest Film of 1994. There are worse things.</Review>

            <Review>When people gripe about Hollywood's reliance on sequels and cheap franchise cash-ins, this is the kind of movie they mean: no Grimm's Fairy Tale, but a grim tale nonetheless.</Review>
            <Review>By cramming far too much material into 114 minutes, The Huntsman: Winter's War feels rushed and incomplete.</Review>
            <Review>The script lifts so much plot from Disney's animated Frozen that it could qualify as a remake. No one sings "Let It Go," but my advice to audiences is to do just that.</Review>
            <Review>Here's hoping that any future installment ditches the Huntsman the way that Snow White was shunted aside, because the evil queens are where it's at.</Review>
            <Review>Freya is given the barest veil of a backstory while Ravenna just oozes ribbons of black bile (literally) for her own evil reasons. These women may be strong but they are never deep.</Review>
            <Review>At least now we have an answer to the question, "Who's the dullest franchise of them all?"</Review>
            <Review>The Huntsman: Winter's War having so many good bits made me me more frustrated than if it had been a wall-to-wall mediocre movie. Because there is potential, and it was squandered.</Review>
            <Review>The heavily female-centered The Huntsman: Winter's War boasts beautiful visual effects and a sense of humor sorely lacking from the original.</Review>
            <Review>Operating somewhere between Once Upon a Time and Game of Thrones, the adventure bounds along with a lot of energy, the odd witty line, nice scenery and some obligatory sprinkles of CGI magic.</Review>
            <Review>The Huntsman is a surprisingly entertaining romp.</Review>
            <Review>What happens when an unnecessary sequel, CGI aplenty, and usually good actors get snow-plowed into each other at hyper-Zamboni speed-none will survive.</Review>
            <Review>Even filled with flaws and missteps aplenty, I got a serious kick out of this sequel, I enjoyed it far more than I imagined I was going to.</Review>

            <Review>The Angry Birds Movie is really not bad. It is actually very actively okay. The film has taken its bird-brained brand... and used it to construct characters and plots that are certainly serviceable, and possibly even inspired.</Review>
            <Review>There's not enough here for a full length feature film - something that becomes obvious the longer the movie is on the screen.</Review>
            <Review>Maybe at this point it's too much to hope for an animated film like The Angry Birds Movie to exist as anything other than marketing fodder, but hopefully it's not too much to ask for that #content to have a shred of substance to it.</Review>
            <Review>Both children and adults will delight in the way the destruction of the pigs' island amplifies the joys of the original game. The effect is an amusing reversal of cultural recognition as the role of the icons expands through reproduction ...</Review>
            <Review>The game "Angry Birds," at its core, is a destination for switching off your brain. And movies, even throw-away summer animated kid films, should aim for something more.</Review>
            <Review>The kids of today deserve better. So do I, come to think of it.</Review>
            <Review>So now even social apps are being turned into feature films? At this rate, should we expect Internet Meme: The Movie next?</Review>
            <Review>The Angry Birds Movie gets the job done, but there are strange tonal shifts here and a surprising amount of off-color jokes.</Review>
            <Review>It's hardly anything about which to raise your eyebrows.</Review>
            <Review>"Inside Out" this is not... the most constructive outlet for anger is a violent bombing of the birds' adversaries, as if Ted Cruz's foreign policy advisor wrote the screenplay.</Review>

            <Review>A torturous exercise in one-note proselytizing.</Review>
            <Review>The audience is encouraged to assume that the widespread persecution of all Christians is at hand. In Arkansas.</Review>
            <Review>"God's Not Dead 2" is filled with a sense of paranoiac persecution and seething resentment towards secular public schools, the ACLU, government interference and those who don't care for "Duck Dynasty."</Review>
            <Review>The agenda here is front and center from start to finish, and while the actors do a yeoman's job in presenting their characters with aplomb, the entire film simply comes off as a two-hour, jazzed-up movie version of a sermon.</Review>

            <Review>To call God's Not Dead 2 "bad" would be doing this abomination of a movie a disservice. It is not only a bad movie, but in fact it's more than that.</Review>
            <Review>Shot in holy high-definition, with lots of histrionic crane shots that swoop down like angels from on high and a score that batters the audience into observance, this is a film that will work best when preaching to the converted.</Review>

            <Review>"11 Minutes" finds veteran Polish writer-director Jerzy Skolimowski in a decidedly experimental mood.</Review>
            <Review>Skolimowski ties these characters' stories so close together that you're never really sure who they are. And that's OK.</Review>
            <Review>Every situation is presented with maximum lucidity and almost complete inscrutability.</Review>
            <Review>An extravagantly pointless exercise in protracting the buildup to some meaningless carnage, garnished with metaphysical pretension so cutesy and vague that it feels actively insulting.</Review>
            <Review>Some people might think this is a brave piece of film making from a true maverick; others will see it as 11 minutes of their lives (repeated over and over from different viewpoints) they'll never get back.</Review>
            <Review>A very confidently-made fractured narrative about various lives intersecting the same 11 minutes in Warsaw.</Review>
            <Review>winking, nudging, puckish</Review>
            <Review>A mad punk smorgasbord of fractured time, multiple narratives, POV shots, vague apocalyptic anxiety and a pounding soundtrack.</Review>
            <Review>At once cleverly experimental and mass-appeal action-oriented, but 11 Minutes contains a major flaw that keeps it from being a superior work.</Review>
            <Review>A frenetic, kinetic, but largely insipid speed through the lives of ostensibly random people in modern day Warsaw.</Review>

            <Review>The best thing about "Sundown" is that it's too dumb to be offensive.</Review>
            <Review>More likely to make you want to avoid Puerto Vallarta than to visit there. Better yet, just avoid 'Sundown.'</Review>
            <Review>Sundown is effective as the story of a kid who is too easily influenced by his friend and who makes a very stupid mistake in pursuit of a girl. It is not effective when it turns violent or starts including an abundance of homophobic and transphobic humor.</Review>
            <Review>Lebrija wants to make a heartfelt statement on love and passion, but he's picked the wrong subgenre to express his sincerity, leaving "Sundown" uneven and eventually out of gas.</Review>
            <Review>A ribald south-of-the-border teen fantasy that's drunk on stale clich√©s.</Review>

            <Review>A comedy where every situation is taken to the extreme, it almost feels like a long music video filmed during spring break. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>

            <Review>The movie is at its best when it recreates what it must feel like to be in a constant state of paranoia and pain. If only that feeling were accompanied by one or two other emotions.</Review>
            <Review>Ambiguity permeates almost every scene in new suspense film "Disorder." That sounds like it could be maddening. Here, the result is darkly compelling ...</Review>
            <Review>"Disorder" may ultimately fall victim to its own narrative ambivalence, but acting this magnetic achieves a clarity all its own.</Review>
            <Review>Tall, dark, and brooding, Belgian actor Matthias Schoenaerts is the man you go to when you need bruised masculinity, International Cinema Division.</Review>
            <Review>Disorder is tense and scary, beautiful to look at and even more gorgeous to hear. In the end, it is also extremely moving. That's the most thrilling part of all.</Review>
            <Review>Alice Winocour's "Disorder" is a tightly wound spring of a movie, a tour de force of sound design and sly editing that implies much more than it shows.</Review>

            <Review>CANNES 2015: Both of its opaque titles ("Maryland" for its Cannes' Un Certain Regard premiere) describe the muddy nature of this unsatisfying thriller.</Review>
            <Review>Disorder is undoubtedly marked by on-screen talent and noble off-screen efforts, but its lagging pace and major tonal shifts keep it from being a great film.</Review>
            <Review>In spite of good acting and a great soundtrack the film starts slow and goes nowhere.</Review>

He doesn't have "his ducks in a row," which only fuels his doubts about being a good father. Guy has been trying to find work in his field for a year with no luck. At wit's end, his wife Anne finds him a job as a 'driver' on Craigslist. Guy shows up for the interview thinking he'll be delivering pizzas, but quickly realizes it's a job driving prostitutes. With money too scarce to turn down, he goes for it-- which is where he meets Nikki, the tough-as-nails, unapologetic sex worker, and her two hilarious and foul-mouthed cohorts, Jaxi and Fallon. As reluctant driver and protector -- Guy is thrust into a world of rockin' women and feeble men. Over the course of one wild and sordid night, and several 'come-to-Jesus' moments, Guy proves to Nikki- and himself- that he does have what it takes to be the responsible father his family deserves.</StoryLine>

            <Review>It's hard to imagine a more Tom Hanks-y setup than this.</Review>
            <Review>It looks expensive and comes off bland.</Review>
            <Review>Not even the mighty Tom Hanks can save this scattershot adaptation of Dave Eggers' lost-soul novel</Review>
            <Review>To describe this as a movie about a mediocre businessman biding his time before an appointment probably makes it sound more exciting than it is.</Review>
            <Review>If it sounds like Hologram is basically about a middle-aged white guy getting his groove back in the Middle East, well, yes, it is that. But if you squint hard enough, it's also a little bit more.</Review>
            <Review>It's a sweet, deliberately meandering movie, and it took me a while to connect with it. But it won me over because ultimately it conveys so well that feeling of estrangement that is both terrifying and comic for any farflung traveler.</Review>
            <Review>The movie, an adaptation of Dave Eggers' 2012 novel of the same name, captures the mercenary basis of corporate culture and Tykwer's love for the visual information conveyed by architecture, but it narrows in scope quickly as romance takes hold.</Review>
            <Review>What Eggers took chapters to establish, Tykwer manages to subliminally install.</Review>
            <Review>This certainly isn't the worst thing he has ever done. Not by a long shot. However, this faithful-ish adaptation of the novel by Dave Eggers is definitely one of Hanksy's more obscure offerings, that's for sure.</Review>
            <Review>You could call A Hologram for the King (2016) a mid-life crisis drama, which is true enough, but it is really a crisis of purpose and identity for an old-school middle-aged businessman trying to remain relevant in the modern world.</Review>
            <Review>What starts off as an intriguing Kafkaesque story about a businessman waiting to meet a king in an unbuilt desert city in Saudi Arabia unexpectedly metamorphoses into a dull romance.</Review>
            <Review>A narrative exercise more complex than what the apparent simplicity of its history might suggest. [Full review in Portuguese.]</Review>

            <Review>A bright jewel of a film, surprisingly funny, fresh and upbeat in the way it takes on the complicated and often dark topic of sexual politics in rural India.</Review>
            <Review>"Parched" is vibrantly alive, full of color and light and movement and music. There is sex in this movie, and there is dancing, and there are vibrant fabrics and foods and fire. It's a dry place, but one ringed with beauty.</Review>
            <Review>Despite the appalling circumstances and events it depicts, the movie's plain and unstinting affection for its lead characters gives "Parched" a frequently buoyant tone.</Review>
            <Review>You can see flashes of bawdy comedic brilliance sprinkled throughout Parched, an otherwise grim Indian drama about four women living in a male-dominated village.</Review>
            <Review>Leena Yadav's third feature is a contemporary morality tale that critiques the often harsh treatment of women in the absence of egalitarian social norms.</Review>
            <Review>Thanks to attentive writing and sturdy performances, the director's characters are so compellingly realized that it's easy to succumb to the film's hopefulness.</Review>
            <Review>The director firmly believes that, if women had the courage to stood up, the situation of her country can change. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Yadav's manages to entertain while telling the story of four women troubled by caste system, obsolete customs and sexism. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Female freedom runs like gusts of wind through hair in Leena Yadav's Parched - refreshing and vital yet easily stilled.</Review>
            <Review>Parched is a confronting film, set in a world of incredible chauvinism.</Review>
            <Review>It is easy to feel the passion with which Yadav tells the story, and to feel intimately connected with her characters, even in the midst of heavy-handed and almost bloated commentary.</Review>

            <Review>Too much goes unsaid and too many issues are unresolved. The scenery is nice, but "Five Nights in Maine" just isn't worth the trip.</Review>
            <Review>Curran guides the cast to commendable performances across the board, with Oyelowo and Wiest delivering controlled, nuanced work to fill in the script's generous negative space.</Review>

            <Review>Considering its subject often enjoys the simple wonder inherent in characters who look into the distance, "Richard Linklater: Dream Is Destiny" does an extra-fine job of looking back with similarly rich and appreciative curiosity.</Review>
            <Review>I enjoyed it immensely.</Review>
            <Review>While not an earth-shaker, this documentary is an amiable, informative look at a guy who is shaping up to be, yes, one of the major American directors of the last fifty years.</Review>
            <Review>It's shamelessly partial but also warmly pleasurable, partly because Mr. Linklater is an engaging and humble conversationalist who moves easily to the beat of his own soundtrack.</Review>
            <Review>A documentary portrait of the director of 'Boyhood' and 'Dazed and Confused' is full of revealing offscreen footage as well as a pinpoint feeling for the filmmaker's visionary humanism.</Review>
            <Review>An admiring documentary that wisely lets Linklater do most of the talking in his plainspoken, unpretentious manner.</Review>
            <Review>A nuanced, thoughtful portrait of the artist as a youngish man (at 56, he retains the philosophically questing mind of a writer-director half his age).</Review>
            <Review>Dream is Destiny is unlikely to convert anyone who isn't already interested in Linklater, but fans of his work will find it a comprehensive and engaging overview of his career and philosophy.</Review>
            <Review>Richard Linklater's dreams are reflected on, in an examination of a singular filmmaker as independent as he is commercial.</Review>
            <Review>An enlightening documentary about a modern film master who is a serious cartographer of the human adventure.</Review>
            <Review>Warm, familial and unhurried portrait of the great Austin auteur provides a good overview of an underappreciated director's work and unusual approach.</Review>
            <Review>The documentary is just more of what we've come to expect from director Richard Linklater's expanded fanverse.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Executive producer Nas presents this vivid inner-city saga set amidst Cleveland's hip-hop underground. Teenage buddies Cisco (Jorge Lendeborg Jr.), Junior (Moises Arias), Boobie (Ezri Walker), and Patty Cake (Rafi Gavron) shrug off school to practice skateboarding, which they hope will be their ticket to a better life. In the meantime, they steal cars to finance their dream. But when they get mixed up in a drug deal and cross a ruthless crime queen-pin (Linda Emond), they put their friendship--and lives--on the line. Set to a choice hip-hop soundtrack and featuring an impressive ensemble cast that includes The Wire's Michael K. Williams, Erykah Badu, and rapper Machine Gun Kelly, The Land crackles with the energy and poetry of the streets.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Steven Caple Jr. is a filmmaker worth watching, here and in the future.</Review>
            <Review>Caple has a unique eye and a strong sense of place. Here's hoping that next time he applies them to a fresher story.</Review>
            <Review>Contrivances spoil the sense of realism and place that Mr. Caple, who wrote the script, often so deftly evokes.</Review>
            <Review>Caple emphasizes the desperation that breeds street crime, and he never tries to puff his kids up into heroes. They're just kids who feel insulted by the few prospects that seem available to them.</Review>
            <Review>There's enough on screen, beyond Lendeborg's confident star turn, to label Caple as a filmmaker to watch.</Review>
            <Review>An at-risk youth movie we've seen many times before in more authentic versions.</Review>
            <Review>The Land isn't a perfect film, but it is a hell of a good start, and director Caple Jr. -- and his young cast -- are artists to keep an eye on, for sure.</Review>
            <Review>Caple and his cinematographer Steven Holleran definitely get the look even if the story doesn't quite deliver, suggesting more and better to come in the future, especially if they get the opportunity to work from a more polished script.</Review>
            <Review>The Land is dedicated to exposing the human story behind inner-city crime, and the film deserves credit for exploring a diverse cross-section of humanity.</Review>
            <Review>I was blown away by this movie.</Review>
            <Review>... tries to dissect the cyclical nature of urban poverty, but the earnest intentions too often become formulaic and predictable.</Review>
            <Review>Unwilling to turn his characters into easily categorized stereotypes, Caple takes his characters in directions that make us rethink our preconceived notions.</Review>

            <Review>A crude yet cuddly comedy written by a star of "The Big Bang Theory."</Review>
            <Review>There are some decent laughs here (especially for a well choreographed sex scene) and even an amusing soundtrack, but there's just not enough story to go around.</Review>
            <Review>The plot is beyond basic and the dialogue so crude it almost feels like an R-rated cartoon. Still, The Bronze has a loony Napoleon Dynamite-meets-Talladega Nights-on-the-balance-beam charm.</Review>
            <Review>This ostensibly edgy comedy didn't wring a single laugh out of me until maybe fifteen minutes before the finale.</Review>
            <Review>I wouldn't want to live next to Hope, but it is fascinating to watch her. And every so often it's refreshing to have a movie that dares to say - you know, no matter what all the screenwriting gurus tell you, some characters never change.</Review>
            <Review>The Bronze often feels like an extended skit, but Hope is so refreshingly unladylike and the movie is so refreshingly cynical about gymnastics that the results are surprisingly amusing.</Review>
            <Review>Relentlessly mean-spirited, but also very, very funny.</Review>
            <Review>[The Bronze has] a tendency not to create a universe and drama, but to impose events, however unlikely and incongruous they may be, to fulfill a pre-determined arc.</Review>
            <Review>Falling short in every way, The Bronze places last in the game of film comedy.</Review>
            <Review>If there are a few sweet moments between Rauch and Middleditch here, they're all but erased by an ineffectual story... and an admittedly impressive void of genuine laughs.</Review>
            <Review>No wonder 'Bronze' didn't bring home the gold.</Review>
            <Review>The movie rises to its highest energy levels in scenes where Rauch has strong foils - and strong actors - to play off. Otherwise, it can be a bit of a slog.</Review>

            <Review>The performances feel unadorned by affect or any contrivance. It's simply the emotions and the words that matter, offered up to contemplate in a meditative cinematic state.</Review>
            <Review>At a time when cynical, pandering 'faith-based' movies have gained an extraordinary foothold at the box office, it should be exhilarating to see a genuinely provocative movie about the trials and tribulations of Jesus Christ. It isn't.</Review>
            <Review>"Last Days in the Desert" soon expands into a meditation on such themes as fathers and sons, family responsibilities, trust, destiny and death ...</Review>
            <Review>Is it scripture? No. Is it flawed, struggling, human? Yes.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately "Last Days in the Desert" never quite hits its stride as either an art piece or a biblical variation.</Review>
            <Review>A quietly compelling portrait of the human side of Jesus, wrestling with his doubts while wandering through the Judean desert.</Review>
            <Review>Last Days in the Desert drags a little too long, but is interesting in its consideration of Jesus as a man, not only a religious figure.</Review>
            <Review>Director of photography Emmanuel Lubezki -- the person who gave you vertigo in Gravity and froze your cheeks in The Revenant -- makes the desert throb with spirituality.</Review>
            <Review>Though Last Days In The Desert isn't a new perspective, that doesn't mean it's not moving, especially in bringing out the loneliness underlying the messiah complex.</Review>
            <Review>A promising exercise in a style of film-making I'd like to see more of, but it's a promise somewhat unfulfilled.</Review>
            <Review>Last Days in the Desert is a Jesus story that plays well for the nonfaithful who nevertheless appreciate the example of Jesus and his teachings.</Review>
            <Review>Yet another meditation on the Jesus story.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2016</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>98</Duration>
        <StoryLine>The setting is the often starkly beautiful Badlands of South Dakota's Pine Ridge Indian Reservation; most of the key players are young Lakota Native Americans who attend Little Wound High School. Johnny and his preteen sister, Jashaun, spend time on horseback when they're not selling illegal liquor or tattoo-designed apparel. Director ChloÔøΩ Zhao captures the subtleties of a marginalized existence in which the historic culture of a people can't compete on a level playing field with the modern problems of poverty, alcoholism, and violence. Amazingly, she embroiders her tale with moments of breathtaking natural beauty that offset the despair her characters struggle against. SONGS is an auspicious debut feature from a director whose superb eye is informed by the sophisticated and nuanced compassion she brings to her story. (Synopsis courtesy of Film Forum.)</StoryLine>

            <Review>A moseying tour of life on the Lakota reservation, circa right now: the empty beauty of the badlands, the ancient struggle with alcohol, and the persistent push of youth to make good and make sense of a bad old world that somehow keeps hope alive.</Review>
            <Review>The cast, composed almost entirely of first-time performers, shows that the most delightful talents don't always belong to lifelong actors.</Review>
            <Review>The slow-paced film includes all the expected social themes - drinking, poverty, broken families. Where Zhao excels is in the range of emotions she gets from a mostly nonprofessional cast.</Review>
            <Review>An earnest, smartly mounted film about life on a present-day reservation.</Review>
            <Review>Viewers will be torn between admiring its laid-back naturalism and wishing it possessed just a little more oomph.</Review>
            <Review>Because her laissez-faire approach makes little effort to fit the fragmentary scenes into a tidy portrait of reservation life, "Songs My Brothers Taught Me" feels more authentic than if she had chosen to impose a tighter structure.</Review>
            <Review>An outsider looking in voyeurism veering offensively close to being more about the filmmaker's fixation on her immigrant alienation - if not a blatant exotic poverty porn aesthetic - than the brutal internal isolation of her subjects absent of causality.</Review>
            <Review>Zhao's film is imperfect, but it's a heartfelt and gorgeous one with a very timely story at its core.</Review>
            <Review>The film is exceptionally rich -- by turns raw, dreamy, harsh, sensuous, touching, intimate, garrulous, and elliptical.</Review>
            <Review>The restrained performances and luscious location photography are enough to make this a film worth exploring, though it might not be a bad idea to down a few caffeine-rich drinks before settling in to watch.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director Chloe Zhao works methodically to set up Johnny's situation, while also capturing in poetic detail the dead-end lives of poverty, alcoholism and hopelessness on the reservation.</Review>
            <Review>It may not qualify as a movie entertainment in the full sense of the word, but it is most certainly an edifying picture of social stagnation at its saddest.</Review>

            <Review>Unfolding with the same sense of paranoid derangement as the infection whose ravages it observes, Summer Camp remains deft in its pacing and endless narrative surprises even as its characters become increasingly hobbled by a succession of injuries.</Review>

            <Review>Come for the abidingly mysterious plot, stay for Hagan's bewitching performance.</Review>
            <Review>The film doesn't always work as a genre exercise, but it's a winner as a character study, in large part because of how committed Hagan is to playing Janie's derangement. Casting directors in search of the offbeat should take note.</Review>
            <Review>Both for better and worse, Sun Choke doesn't spell anything out for anyone.</Review>

            <Review>Hagan is great, but the picture isn't, better appreciated as a directorial exercise for a burgeoning filmmaker than an engrossing exploration of insanity.</Review>
            <Review>Sun Choke succeeds in telling a small-scale story with tons of interest, abandoning typical plot structures in favor of genuine discovery.</Review>

            <Review>A note-perfect exploration of death and life and loss.</Review>
            <Review>The people aren't people here; they're not even types - just instruments for conveying words and pictures, some of which are artful, but not nearly enough to make up for the dire drear and maudlin indulgence.</Review>
            <Review>Two sons and their father grapple with their dysfunctional family situation, resulting in some reflective, engaging drama.</Review>
            <Review>Here is a drama about a troubled family that builds not to a crescendo of screams and confrontations, but toward empathy and understanding.</Review>
            <Review>There are moments of almost unspeakable beauty in the film, not the least of which are Isabelle's war zone photographs. Like the movie itself, they dare you to look away but award you deeply for baring witness.</Review>
            <Review>A ponderous, overwrought meditation on grief, loss, guilt, and memory that prods and probes its characters more like lab rats than living, breathing creations.</Review>
            <Review>It's a tale which unfolds nuance by nuance, and with each insight it becomes easier to empathise with both father and sons. Trier may work quietly but he knows all about pace and subtlety.</Review>
            <Review>Softly-spoken but emotionally potent.</Review>
            <Review>[An] intelligent, aesthetically pleasing adult drama that feels casually, realistically international in its cast and themes. And that's surprisingly rare.</Review>
            <Review>A draining, but rewarding exploration of both a death in the family, and perhaps, the death of a family.</Review>
            <Review>An ambitiously thorough yet quiet exploration of familial dysfunction.</Review>
            <Review>Of the various themes explored in this complex story, Joachim Trier's fascination with the way our memories are manipulated by our unconscious is the most interesting</Review>

            <Review>Not bad for a first feature. And a mad-cute kitten. Help it make some money this weekend so they can all do it again.</Review>
            <Review>Once you settle into Keanu, it works. And in many ways, it's of a piece with everything else Key and Peele have done.</Review>
            <Review>The joke wears out sooner than it should, but the stars of Keanu (including, yes, that terrific cat) do a decent job distracting from that.</Review>
            <Review>Even if this movie is basically just engaging nonsense with a lot of heart, its darker edges tell another story.</Review>
            <Review>Keanu is much like the ravenous cat loving Internet audience that one assumes is going to eat this up. Once it's done, if it wasn't in your iTunes rental receipts you may forget it altogether.</Review>
            <Review>This big-screen venture from the comedy team of Key and Peele might have worked better as a sketch on their eponymous television show than it does at feature length.</Review>
            <Review>Abbott and Costello. Laurel and Hardy. Martin and Lewis. Cheech and Chong. Just four of some of the most popular comedy teams that went on to success on the big screen. Time to add a new team to the list: Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele...</Review>

            <Review>The film lacks visual ingenuity, but the point isn't to show us something new - it's to tell us something we might not have heard. And what Chomsky says is as unsettling as it is persuasive.</Review>
            <Review>As one expects, Chomsky again proves to know more about his targets than they seem to know about themselves, calling on bits of history that damn not only the business-boosting right wing, but those on the supposed left side of American politics.</Review>
            <Review>A very useful addition to public discourse at any time. But it's particularly so during this election year ...</Review>
            <Review>The film isn't necessarily pegged to the upcoming election per se, but the logic presented within helps make sense of current affairs.</Review>
            <Review>This feature by Peter Hutchison, Kelly Nyks, and Jared P. Scott presents a cogent and incisive lesson in how the superwealthy control the federal government.</Review>
            <Review>Few will agree with every word spoken, but Chomsky's vision of history is worth encountering and considering.</Review>
            <Review>The directors bring to filmic life Chomsky's calm, composed talking-points--his measured, reasonable long-view of history and polic--with inventive framing of archival footage and coolly sharp images. A potent Panama Papers-era dissection of power.</Review>
            <Review>It's a swirling, upsetting picture that gets bigger and scarier the more he talks.</Review>
            <Review>[E]ye-opening, consciousness-expanding, and - ho boy yes indeedy - angry-making stuff.</Review>
            <Review>If you're looking for intellectual entertainment combined with political outrage, Requiem for the American Dream fulfills the contract.</Review>
            <Review>Requiem for the American Dream is valuable as a document of Chomsky while we still have him, but the people he's inspired may be his true legacy.</Review>
            <Review>Noam Chomsky's theories of inequality are important but dry.</Review>

            <Review>The Lobster argues that the kind of pressure society places on us to find a soulmate can lead to reckless choices. But the movie gives the alternative - people who are happy being single - the same radical treatment.</Review>
            <Review>Lanthimos doesn't deliver all the way, but he sticks his landing mightily and whets appetites for whatever he decides to do next.</Review>
            <Review>If you're open to embracing a film that declines to pander to expectations, you should definitely make a date with "The Lobster."</Review>
            <Review>Lanthimos forgoes easy sentiments about the transformative power of love; this may turn off some viewers, but there's a certain liberation and even some relief in knowing that societal pressure to settle down can be just as cruel as loneliness.</Review>
            <Review>Highly original and mordantly funny. Perfect for fans of Franz Kafka, Charlie Kaufman and other bleak surrealists.</Review>
            <Review>Lanthimos's unsettling tour de force reminds us of how chained to coupledom dignity remains at both the private and public level.</Review>
            <Review>Lanthimos makes brutal, incisive points to make about the absurdity of coupling in the first place, much less society's view of what makes a perfect couple.</Review>
            <Review>Lanthimos is obviously after bigger game than a black relationship comedy, every detail (even the most horrifying) in the movie contributes to what is becoming Lanthimos' signature tone of heartbreaking hilarity.</Review>
            <Review>"The Lobster" peters out about halfway through but regardless, director Lanthimos and co-writer Filippou have constructed a singular and ambitious vision, rich with symbolism and observant commentary about societal pressures to pair up.</Review>
            <Review>Lanthimos invests his absurdist parable with a dark, deadpan humor and an eerie poetry....</Review>
            <Review>The Lobster is brilliant, but it's bleak.</Review>

            <Review>High-Rise switches genres effortlessly - black humour one moment, dystopic parable the next - until it becomes its own singular, horrifying, immensely captivating thing.</Review>
            <Review>No matter how much one shades the characters, though, High-Rise defies adaptation because the most vivid character is the building itself.</Review>
            <Review>There is a goldmine of rich material here, all beautifully shot, but fatally lacking in focus or momentum.</Review>
            <Review>It could take decades for critics and audiences to appreciate whatever genius lurks behind the chaos, but for the time being, it seems like little more than madness.</Review>
            <Review>Director Ben Wheatley ("Kill List") is masterful with arresting imagery set in a dystopian spin on the '70s; less so with a compelling narrative.</Review>
            <Review>I soon found myself wanting to wash off the modernist stench of Wheatley's world. And yet it's entrancing all the same, so much so that like Laing and his fellows, I had no desire to leave the high-rise.</Review>
            <Review>Wheatley's camera repeatedly dollies in towards Laing, as if pursuing something it can't catch, and that forlorn quest is an elevator ride to the top of High-Rise that never arrives.</Review>
            <Review>It is chaotic and crazy, shambolic and discombobulating, all elements of the novel but not necessarily of coherent filmmaking.</Review>
            <Review>All of you out there stuck living in cramped apartments should adore it -- but please, don't go getting any ideas.</Review>
            <Review>It's a very British subject, this obsession with class differences and class warfare, but Wheatley's compelling handling of the material -- though criticised in some quarters for its deliberately alienating elements -- seems on the mark.</Review>
            <Review>Collet-Serra seems as transfixed by the landscape as he is by Lively's presence, suggesting a continuity between humanity and the natural world.</Review>
            <Review>It's meant to leave a bad taste and it does. High-Rise is an effective adaptation of a classic dystopian novel that no longer seems like science fiction.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Teenaged sisters Emma (Sofia Black-D'Elia) and Stacey (Analeigh Tipton) live a normal life, until their small suburban neighborhood is stricken with a mysterious parasitic virus.

            <Review>At its best, and it gets pretty good after a really rocky start, "Bite" is a clever gorefest with some creative twists and turns.</Review>
            <Review>After an opening 10 minutes that promises something depressingly mediocre, the film takes a turn to the atmospheric and gruesome, and winds up being one of the year's more provocative shockers.</Review>
            <Review>It seems to exist merely to spoil your appetite.</Review>
            <Review>Bite is still a wholly ambitious affair and a tenacious effort from Chad Archibald, who proves he has a strong grasp of how to make an intelligent horror movie that often defies genre expectations.</Review>
            <Review>"Bite" is a slimily well-made creature feature undercut by its near-constant divorce from logic.</Review>
            <Review>While Bite will make you squirm with mounds and mounds of bile-inducing horror, the film fails to offer much else as you care little about any of the characters and the story is familiar ground that has been done before with more satisfying results</Review>
            <Review>an expertly rendered gross-out that never takes itself too seriously, although there are times when you wish it had taken itself a little more seriously</Review>

            <Review>Shame on anyone who falls for the hype.</Review>
            <Review>Bite is rife with unfulfilled potential. Even if all you want is to be grossed out, it doesn't push the envelope far enough and lacks the originality and sense of fun that could've made it a cult favorite.</Review>

        <Duration>97</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Ruby Adams (Keenan Kampa) is a dancer from the Midwest on scholarship, living her first day in New York City. Johnny Blackwell (Nicholas Galitzine) is a British musician, playing for money in the subway tunnels. Ruby's world is classical and disciplined; Johnnie's is improvisational and street smart. When a hip-hop battle gone wrong throws these two artists together, they immediately clash but can't deny it when sparks begin to fly. Their lives quickly get entangled in the pitfalls that come with competing in New York City. With the help of a dynamic dance crew called The SwitchSteps, Ruby and Johnnie must find a way to save Ruby's scholarship and keep Johnnie from being deported. In an action-packed extravaganza combining cutting edge hip-hop with contemporary and classical dance, the two must navigate their opposing worlds and prepare for a competition where winning or losing will change their lives forever. HIGH STRUNG is elevated by standout supporting performances from veteran actors Jane Seymour, Paul Freeman and Maia Morgenstern and features an original soundtrack of boundary-breaking commercial tracks blending styles of music in a way that already has the dance industry and social media talking. The film's original take on familiar musical genres sets it apart from prior dance franchises: Step Up and Street Dance. It's brought to viewers by Broadway stars Michael and Janeen Damian and top choreographer Dave Scott (Step Up 3D; Stomp the Yard; resident choreographer on So You Think You Can Dance; guest choreographer on Dancing with the Stars) and introduces the breathtakingly talented Keenan Kampa (Russia's Mariinsky Ballet's first American dancer) and Nicholas Galitzine (The Beat Beneath My Feet) alongside 62 of some of the World's most exciting and original dancers from London, Paris, L.A. and New York.</StoryLine>

            <Review>The movie gets a lot less interesting once it starts to go dark, so to speak, and the elements of the story that you had identified as red herrings earlier on turn out to be, yup, red herrings.</Review>
            <Review>"The Trust" betrays its hidden wispiness as the comic edge dissipates and a dreary darkness takes over.</Review>
            <Review>Wood and Cage have a terrific dynamic together.</Review>
            <Review>The script, by Adam Hirsch and Benjamin Brewer, is full of both humor and menace, giving the actors plenty to work with. That makes for an enjoyably slow buildup to an unexpected ending.</Review>
            <Review>"The Trust" is a so-so heist movie whose dirty-cop character's personality must have been described in the screenplay as "Nicolas Cage-esque." Fortunately, Cage was available.</Review>
            <Review>Even with all its flaws, The Trust is still a far superior Nicolas Cage film than anything we've seen in recent times.</Review>
            <Review>The Trust is a vehicle that works for both Cage and Wood. The Brewer brothers must have seen what could be done with the pair's unlikely chemistry and the strange, murky darkness and black humor that emerges from it.</Review>
            <Review>It's a smart, well-observed piece, and it has a jet black sense of humor that makes it feel like something special. It's very small, and because of that, it feels very focused.</Review>
            <Review>The Trust is a heist movie that gives Nicolas Cage his juiciest performance since Kick-Ass and indulges some very kooky Cageian line readings.</Review>
            <Review>Some of the quirkier touches feel a little forced but more often than not there's a winning sense of oddball charm.</Review>

            <Review>The American Side is a swell trip on one of those cheesy carnival rides, and you'll know it's time to get off the roller coaster when the credits roll.</Review>
            <Review>True to form, the screenplay... is barely coherent in its explication of the convoluted plotline. But it does provide a fair share of hard-boiled, frequently amusing dialogue and a plethora of colorful characters.</Review>
            <Review>The American Side shows glimmers of ingenuity, both with its use of Tesla mystique and with atmospheric location work that makes Buffalo a presence.</Review>
            <Review>While The American Side may not quite achieve the classic thriller tone to which it aspires, it does create an enjoyably hard-boiled world.</Review>
            <Review>It's an intriguing neo-film-noir, and amusingly convoluted (in the challenging tradition of the genre.)</Review>
            <Review>Tesla, government black ops, and a shadowy cabal running the world all wrapped up in a nifty neo-noir that pays suitable homage to the genre. Be still my foolish heart.</Review>
            <Review>This Nikola Tesla-inspired conspiracy shoots for too much wonder and darkness at once, too wed to Greg Stuhr's gullible gumshoe to make a memorable noir on the cheap.</Review>
            <Review>The American Side never quite adds up to a satisfying experience, but that's made up for by the cavalcade of familiar faces in small parts, including Matthew Broderick, Harris Yulin, Robert Forster -- and, most excitingly, Janeane Garofalo.</Review>
            <Review>Invoking fascinating conspiracy theories surrounding Nikola Tesla only to turn them into a macguffin, this neonoir detective flick ultimately disappoints.</Review>
            <Review>Even though the genre is tried and true, The American Side constantly remains fresh.</Review>
            <Review>The film loses its power of engagement early on and fails to regain its footing, despite many worthy tries.</Review>

While people have always found something to be offended by, their ability to organize a groundswell of opposition to--and public censure of--their offender has never been more powerful. Today we're all one clumsy joke away from public ruin. Can We Take A Joke? offers a thought-provoking and wry exploration of outrage culture through the lens of stand-up comedy, with notables like Gilbert Gottfried, Penn Jillette, Lisa Lampanelli, and Adam Carolla detailing its stifling impact on comedy and the exchange of ideas.

            <Review>The plot is even more nonsensical than it sounds, but the monsters' high-energy antics and the humans' martial-arts skills make for a delightfully bizarre adventure romp.</Review>
            <Review>This film is pleasantly cheesy, and probably more interesting than anything that's currently being marketed to your not-so-picky kids. Try it, they'll like it.</Review>
            <Review>Some of this recalls Stephen Chow's "Journey to the West," minus the brilliance.</Review>
            <Review>The film is far from perfect, but it's certainly ambitious, often entertaining and, compared to the feeble competition from new American films of the moment, a singing, dancing, stomping and chomping "Citizen Kane."</Review>
            <Review>"Monster Hunt" broke box office records in China, but American viewers may wonder why this confused and confusing adventure-comedy enthralled audiences there.</Review>
            <Review>Director Raman Hui mixes martial-arts fights and slapstick comedy (lots of mugging by Jing) into a whimsical, fast-paced monster mash.</Review>
            <Review>Monster Hunt is far more engaging as cultural commentary than as entertainment.</Review>
            <Review>There's a charm that makes Monster Hunt worth seeing if only for curiosity's sake.</Review>
            <Review>Kid-friendly fare amusing enough to entertain adults, too, provided their brains are on pause!</Review>
            <Review>The effort into the sets, costumes, and cinematography are immaculate and everything is done for fun. Just don't expect Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.</Review>
            <Review>An oddball m√©lange of action, slapstick, sentimentality and ghoulishness, all wrapped up into one big, galumphing package... more a curiosity than a delight, but the adventurous might want to give the sweet-and-sour dish a try.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is a mixed bag, but one filled with imagination and ingenuity, and as such as nuts as Monster Hunt proves to be it's also just enjoyable enough to make dealing with its wildly perverse lapses into pandemonium worth enduring.</Review>

            <Review>It stands out thanks to the graceful, thoughtful characterization of its three protagonists, despite their potential to be monstrous caricatures.</Review>
            <Review>Tallulah is such a funny, insightful, engrossing and slightly twisted dysfunctional family drama.</Review>
            <Review>Tallulah is an enchanting, sharp little gem</Review>
            <Review>Even if the tale is a bit much to be believed at times, it's unlikely you'll see a film more refreshingly honest and incisive about motherhood than "Tallulah."</Review>
            <Review>In its greatest achievement, the writing and directing of Tallulah articulates the intangible sacrifice and stresses of motherhood.</Review>
            <Review>Tallulah is easily one of the underdog films of the year and was entertaining from beginning to end.</Review>
            <Review>This Netflix original film falls into the old "weepie/women's picture" category, but it stays stubbornly rooted in characters and moments.</Review>
            <Review>Largely engrossing and impeccably acted, watching stars Ellen Page, Allison Janney, and Tammy Blanchard create living, breathing people who aren't easy to watch, yet it's hard to ignore their fascinating surges of pain.</Review>
            <Review>Ellen Page is one of the most inherently likable actors of her generation, and her amiability is on full display in Tallulah.</Review>
            <Review>"Tallulah" is a great example of a women-led movie with plenty of social substance and earthy grit.</Review>

        <StoryLine>What happens when the world's most acclaimed restaurant picks up and moves halfway across the world? Named for just one of the many surprising dishes that RenÔøΩ Redzepi serves at his esteemed Copenhagen foodie destination Noma (named "World's Best Restaurant" in 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2014), Ants on a Shrimpfollows the superstar chef and his team as they relocate to Japan to set up a five-week pop-up in Tokyo. But creating an all-new, fourteen-course menu foraged from local sources in an unfamiliar country presents unforeseen challenges-and may be a make-or-break moment for the risk-taking Redzepi's career. This cross-cultural culinary odyssey is both a behind-the-scenes look at a food world visionary and a mouthwatering showcase for some of the most adventurous cuisine on the planet.</StoryLine>

            <Review>The Boss is sketch comedy, with none of the lines colored in.</Review>
            <Review>Dinklage is awful as the foppish villain, and aside from one uproarious, ad-libbed riff, McCarthy seems to be on autopilot.</Review>
            <Review>An opportunity to watch a comedic performer at the top of her game revel boldly in her own confident weirdness.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is all too neat a package for McCarthy's exuberantly inventive comic artistry.</Review>
            <Review>Even though The Boss is co-written by McCarthy and her husband, director Ben Falcone (who should know his wife's strengths better), the film often strands its title character in shrill one-note caricature, mostly unchallenged.</Review>
            <Review>I persist in believing that Melissa McCarthy is capable of starring in a movie that not only makes a scads of money but is -- you know -- good. The latest refutation of my belief is The Boss.</Review>
            <Review>There's something irrepressible about McCarthy's shtick. Her foul-mouthed rants are always amusing, even when they're not quite laugh-out-loud funny.</Review>
            <Review>The Boss is pretty much a by-the-numbers comedy that comes nowhere near last year's Spy, which saw her on top form.</Review>
            <Review>Sergeant Bilko meets Horatio Alger in this flick of solid goofiness and a rollicking good time.</Review>
            <Review>Needlessly starting out on such a false, bombastic note emblematizes the film's mistake of blowing up the character past what made her recognizable, and thereby funny, in the first place.</Review>
            <Review>A film that is both funny and works to McCarthy's strengths. It is a little over the top at times (and a little more "adult" than you might expect) but it's definitely a film that will make you laugh out loud.</Review>
            <Review>Melissa McCarthy brings another of her improvisational alter-egos to the big screen with this energetic comedy.</Review>

        <Duration>81</Duration>
        <StoryLine>A thrilling investigation into the ghosts of the Soviet Union and the mind of an irradiated Ukrainian artist on a quest to discover the 'criminal' behind the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. Unforgettably eccentric artist Fedor Alexandrovich begins his quest by revealing to the world an enormous secret Soviet weapon that stands in the shadow of Chernobyl, and which Kremlinologists in the 1980s thought might be a giant mind-control device. But what Fedor discovers is much more sinister. While his theory that Chernobyl was an inside job may seem mad, the audience too starts to question reality when secret police appear and one of the crew members is shot by a sniper, as revolution, paranoia and terror engulf the crew. This Sundance Grand Jury winner and darling of critics worldwides pushes the boundaries of the documentary form while telling a crucial story about the deadly dance between Ukraine and Russia, and hinting at what Putin has in mind next.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Mr. Gracia's messily structured film works best as a document of fear in today's Ukraine and as a kind of ghost story about the Soviet Union.</Review>
            <Review>The Russian Woodpecker is only valuable as entertainment, though the absence of any equivalent to the Zapruder film or allegedly suspicious NASA photos means there's not much visual interest.</Review>

            <Review>An unexpectedly compelling political thriller.</Review>

            <Review>The fourth entry in the Barbershop franchise delivers keen social commentary, bringing back many of the key players from the 2002 and 2004 installments.</Review>
            <Review>Leaving aside the humorous cultural escapism of the early aughts, The Next Cut faces the racial and political issues of 2016 head on.</Review>
            <Review>This Barbershop is simply a place where we can all laugh together, sometimes at ideas that veer close to being explosive.</Review>
            <Review>It's refreshing to encounter a sequel that leans deeper into sociopolitical realities, not further away.</Review>
            <Review>It's stagey, often simplistic and it talks too damn much. But, hell, the talk has flavor and snap and a real-world sense of a community in crisis. Not bad for an escapist romp.</Review>
            <Review>Next time? Just a little off the top please, and leave the socio-political commentary to others.</Review>
            <Review>The barbs are scissor-sharp, making this a threequel that delivers what you want while throwing in some surprises.</Review>
            <Review>Barbershop: The Next Cut brings topical social issues into the narrative but only starts meaningful conversations without genuinely pushing them forward.</Review>
            <Review>The best of the Barbershop quartet (following 2002's Barbershop, 2004's Barbershop: Back in Business, and 2005's Beauty Shop), Barbershop: The Next Cut offers more laughs and more meaningful commentary than previous installments in the series.</Review>
            <Review>The first one to really get a semblance of the first movie's charm back. It's easily the best of the sequels.</Review>
            <Review>Like its predecessors, the third in the "Barbershop" series is rough around the edges, by turns funny, jubilant and sentimental, sometimes forced, but rarely phony.</Review>
            <Review>It's like a PG-13, dad version of Chi-Raq. The message, if a little preachy and a little schmaltzy, is also worthy and well-meant.</Review>

            <Review>Hawke makes this sweeter, gentler Baker believable in a schoolgirl-diary way-this is the Baker we want to believe in when we lie back in the embrace of his trumpet sound.</Review>
            <Review>Born to Be Blue doesn't pretend to have all the answers. What it does have - in addition to an immersive performance from Ethan Hawke as the cool-cat jazz man - is an emotional understanding of who Baker was, or may have been.</Review>
            <Review>The film draws you deeply into Baker's fantasy world, to the point that the entreaty of his famous recording, "Let's Get Lost," almost seems like a good idea.</Review>
            <Review>When Hawke's Baker finally slips out of the whiney loser persona and performs "My Funny Valentine," the scene evokes Baker's elusive melancholy and wistful torment, making the earlier fumblings worth the struggle.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director Robert Budreau takes a stylised approach to this biopic of the legendary jazz artist Chet Baker, combining the achingly soulful music with an equally resonant performance from Ethan Hawke.</Review>
            <Review>For all its deviations from biographical fact, Born to be Blue does finally capture something that is inescapably there on the records (and in that loaded title): the melancholy that, like the music, was forever in Baker's blood.</Review>
            <Review>Whispery and jazzy and niche market, it is hooked around an excellent performance from Hawke.</Review>
            <Review>Ethan Hawke puts in a career- best turn as jazz trumpeter Chet Baker in this imaginatively structured biopic.</Review>
            <Review>Touched by resonant tragedies amongst his own friends and learning to play the trumpet for the role, Hawke is compelling, offering a magnetic portrayal of an exasperating but deeply charismatic, engaging figure.</Review>
            <Review>As Baker, Ethan Hawke is intensely committed -- subtly conveying a complex mix of frailty and arrogance -- and there is strong work from Ejogo as well as Callum Scott Rennie as Baker's long-suffering ally, Pacific Jazz Records founder Dick Bock.</Review>

            <Review>In a demanding role light on dialogue, Sutherland's rangy, loping physicality serves both the character and the action well ...</Review>
            <Review>Dagg does a decent job of helming a tale that is not particularly complex or edifying, although an interesting twist at the end will almost certainly divide audiences.</Review>
            <Review>Sutherland is superbly frayed, seeming to get appreciably thinner and more shell-like every minute.</Review>
            <Review>Notwithstanding an atmospheric backdrop and what looks like a grueling shoot, Dagg's thriller is slow to get going and hampered by an inexpressive leading man.</Review>
            <Review>As thrillers go, the thrill is gone fairly quickly. But give River points for appearing to ask hard questions about do-gooders in far-away places.</Review>
            <Review>This cat-and-mouse thriller might be set in Laos, but its contrivances are right out of Hollywood.</Review>
            <Review>Jamie M. Dagg's gripping thriller traces the moral fluidity of foreign volunteer work.</Review>
            <Review>A lean, riveting and gritty thriller.</Review>
            <Review>The danger of being a wanted man is only compounded by his inability to speak the language, and his sticking out like a sore thumb, making him increasingly desperate as he tries to reach the embassy and get back home.</Review>

            <Review>Begins as a fitfully intriguing character study before flying off the rails as a nightmarish vision of government encroachment on free thought.</Review>
            <Review>It looks and feels like a particularly well made student film (so many colored filters), but the subject matter is rather more interesting and weirdly plausible than the recent spate of big-budget AI films.</Review>
            <Review>Sullins' movie has its heart and brain in the right place, but its guts are a mess.</Review>
            <Review>Director/screenwriter Khalil Sullins makes an auspicious feature debut with his audacious sci-fi thriller that's as engrossing as it is thought-provoking.</Review>
            <Review>Too bad Sullins doesn't have a movie's worth of story out of this premise. Rather than pioneering into the frontiers of the mind, Listening slogs through the most well-traveled pits of screenwriting.</Review>
            <Review>This is where Listening really falls apart - it doesn't seem to know what it wants to be.</Review>
            <Review>Naive, hamfisted, and amateurish indie sci-fi... but as hilarious as the clumsy, clich√©d execution is, it still isn't even worth it for the laughs.</Review>
            <Review>... Listening displays courage: in embracing bold stylization and colors in an age of washed-out, gritty sci-fi; in not retreating from the more horrific aspects of the involved science...</Review>
            <Review>Meditation as a countermeasure against a sinister mind-control conspiracy is a novel idea; too bad it's wedged into a rickety framework of numbingly conventional dramatic complications, half-hearted eroticism, and pervasive humorlessness.</Review>

            <Review>Kinnaman's weekend father is a return to form, a twitchy, deeply flawed character we can't help rooting for even as we fear the worst ... He reminded me of Nicholson in 'The Shining' ...</Review>
            <Review>Edge of Winter is still frosty enough to cut through its sometimes inert tone and a flat soundtrack.</Review>

            <Review>The movie is a little more fun than it has any right to be, thanks to its super-serious cast (including Tommy Lee Jones, Ryan Reynolds, Gary Oldman, and Gal Gadot) and the straight-faced approach to its ridiculous shenanigans.</Review>
            <Review>All the ingredients are there for a pleasant pander to grumpy old white men: the craggy actors, the foreign bad guys wielding confusing technology, the kindness of beautiful young women, and the nobility of sacrifice.</Review>

            <Review>This is not always a subtle film, but its spooky mood leaves a strong impression.</Review>
            <Review>This is a director's showcase and Corbet, with the support of a superb tech team (especially composer Scott Walker) impresses and fascinates.</Review>
            <Review>The Childhood of a Leader is a dark and creepy work, flawed but ambitious and well worth seeing.</Review>
            <Review>Studious in its homages to somber masters past and present, The Childhood Of A Leader pulls out intriguing moments whenever it threatens to turn repetitious.</Review>
            <Review>All dread all the time, and rich enough in mood that you may be inclined to forgive the familiarity of its narrative trajectory and anchoring psychology.</Review>
            <Review>That it has the courage of cryptic-ness, and leaves sympathetic viewers intrigued long after its final images have faded, is enough to mark The Childhood of a Leader as an uncommonly promising debut.</Review>
            <Review>Bold and intelligent, this dark drama is a challenging portrait of the making of an authoritarian dictator.</Review>
            <Review>Childhood is less a j'accuse than a bad, half-remembered dream about history.</Review>
            <Review>The film, shot in very dark hues, has a sombre power and twisted humour about it that is only accentuated by its elliptical narrative style.</Review>
            <Review>[A] bold and brilliant debut that heralds a major new talent.</Review>
            <Review>There are times when you feel as though very little is happening, but this is a bold, uncompromising film that gradually takes a hold.</Review>

            <Review>Quitters has more style than substance, but it's a cut above most, mainly because first-time director and co-writer Noah Pritzker has a lot of sensitivity toward a familiar subject that renders it real and touching if not exactly original.</Review>
            <Review>A challenging and joyless experience.</Review>
            <Review>[A] keenly observed, utterly contemporary group portrait of disconnected individuals, both young and old, whose lives are on spiritual and emotional lockdown.</Review>
            <Review>Dysfunction and a sense of entitlement govern the behavior of the characters in the film, which portrays upscale American life as an ethical vacuum in which selfish, indifferent people act on impulse without regard to the consequences.</Review>
            <Review>What do you do with a loathsome hero? Noah Pritzker isn't sure.</Review>
            <Review>Well-layered film about a disenfranchised young man fleeing a disintegrating family life and seeking refuge in the home of his putative girlfriend.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director Pritzker has conjured up an utterly believable, sympathetic yet vile monster -- a smart, self-righteous, self-absorbed teen.</Review>
            <Review>Schoolyard angst and affluent dysfunction come together like peanut butter and jelly in Noah Pritzker's feature debut as writer and director.</Review>
            <Review>There is obvious talent in the storytelling but at times the reserved style of filmmaking feels televisual and there 's no spark to really get the film going.</Review>

            <Review>There's a beauty in the breakdown, and it's amongst the rubble that Davis finds himself living, rather than enduring, his life.</Review>
            <Review>There is much to savor here, especially the unforced performance of Judah Lewis -- one more recruit to the terrific roster of younger actors who are streaming into the movies. Yet the film lacks the courage of its affliction.</Review>
            <Review>Thank god for Jake Gyllenhaal. Absent his performance, Demolition would have been a more unbearable slog than it is.</Review>
            <Review>Director Jean-Marc Vall√©e doesn't seem to mind when his movies become sun-dappled insta-redemption stories so long as there's a bravura central turn holding it all down.</Review>
            <Review>The best I can say is that it's another tour de force for Gyllenhaal, although his intensity isn't matched by the movie itself.</Review>
            <Review>The deadpan and sometimes excruciating discomfort on display, played for laughs, calls to mind the early, emotionally subversive films of David O. Russell.</Review>
            <Review>A scene of emotional redemption, involving a dilapidated carousel being remodelled, may be the most cloying screen sequence in the year to date.</Review>
            <Review>There are genuine, moving moments and some hilarious ones but overall it tries too hard to put a new spin on an age-old topic.</Review>
            <Review>Prevents an entertainingly intriguing character study from being engrossingly fascinating.</Review>
            <Review>Gyllenhaal is terrific as Davis, a role that requires him to control his emotions until they threaten to pop, and then incrementally, imperceptibly let the pressure off.</Review>
            <Review>A flawed yet deeply moving meditation on grief from Dallas Buyers Club director Jean-Marc Vall√©e.</Review>

            <Review>The spectacle of Presley visiting Nixon's buttoned-down White House in his jeweled sunglasses, silk scarf, open shirt, and giant gold belt is inherently farcical, but Elvis &amp; Nixon might have delivered more than dumb laughs.</Review>
            <Review>The dialogue sparkles with gems of historical allusion and perceptive asides, and the actors virtually sing it; the film plays like a whirling sociopolitical operetta.</Review>
            <Review>As a surreal slice of history served up nearly half a century later, it feels oddly satisfying: A reminder not just of simpler times, but of all the other wild untold stories we may never know, just because no camera was there to capture them.</Review>
            <Review>What the movie, directed by Liza Johnson, lacks in factual material it replaces with whimsy and quirky humour, helped greatly by the casting of Michael Shannon as Presley and Kevin Spacey as Nixon.</Review>
            <Review>A sharper movie would have pushed this bizarre incident into psychological rawness, revealing a shared sense of paranoia. Breezy, comic and disposable, Elvis &amp; Nixon is not that film.</Review>
            <Review>Even when I didn't buy a word being said, I went with the flow. Why? Michael Shannon as Elvis and Kevin Spacey as Tricky Dick. Watching great actors swing for the fences is something special.</Review>
            <Review>It's entertaining to watch, but the script misses the chance to add meaning on the situation.</Review>
            <Review>A funny and speculative comedy with an historical context. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>The satirical energy picks up considerably once the King finally arrives at the White House, but the two halves are so different that it's worth considering whether the material would have worked better as a one-act play.</Review>
            <Review>The film moves quickly, buoyed by the performances of its stars.</Review>
            <Review>After keeping the two apart for so long, when Elvis and Nixon do meet, the movie shines. Both lead-actors have great fun teasing out the absurdity of the situation, while neither falls into the danger zone of caricaturing their real life subjects.</Review>
            <Review>Michael Shannon accomplishes a powerful performance as Elvis at the peak of his fame and the brink of his demise.</Review>

            <Review>Writer-director-star Don Cheadle gives a towering performance that the film simply can't keep up with; he's truly on his own, which is perhaps the way Davis would have wanted it.</Review>
            <Review>A jazzy and unconventional tribute to an American icon, "Miles Ahead" is quite a ride.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately, Cheadle's labor of love prizes the music-making over the music, and maybe even over the man.</Review>
            <Review>The problem with "Miles Ahead" isn't the playful, broad license it takes with Davis' story, but that it's so silly.</Review>
            <Review>Ridiculous? To be sure. Engaging? You bet.</Review>
            <Review>...Cheadle hasn't made the definitive cinematic portrait of Davis, he has ...made a very entertaining, outrageous movie.</Review>
            <Review>As a fictional movie based on true events, "Miles Ahead" is perfect. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Comes across mostly as "Comic Sketches of Miles," with the musical, beating heart of the film coming in the middle upon the late appearance of his muse and a finale concert.</Review>

From scientific gatherings to NASA's high-stakes Space Elevator Games, the film follows the major players working to make the concept a reality. Some believe it will solve the energy crisis; some want easier access to raw materials in space; some just want to gaze down upon the Earth. For all of them, the space elevator is more than just science fiction: it's an achievable goal. (c) FilmBuff</StoryLine>

            <Review>There is a welcome (and surprising) layer of complexity running through the film that makes it a little bit more than your standard fare. The likable and funny ensemble helps too.</Review>

            <Review>Doggedly follows the well-worn rom-com path, down to saving all the personality and occasional laughs - very, very occasional ones - for the supporting cast.</Review>

            <Review>A movie that beats you into submission and makes you wonder if the sun will ever come out again.</Review>
            <Review>Batman v Superman is a tiresome, ill-tempered film, and one too lazy even to earn its dismal outlook.</Review>
            <Review>When in doubt, [Snyder] simply slings another ingredient into the mix, be it an irradiated monster, an explosion on government premises, or the sharp smack of masonry on skull.</Review>
            <Review>If only the film actually had depth, along with a little levity to lighten the bulk in the script, the visual murk and the sonic overkill.</Review>
            <Review>A ponderous, smothering, over-pixelated zeppelin crash of a movie scored by a choir that sounds like it's being drowned in lava.</Review>
            <Review>It's freighted not so much with entertainment value as it is with enough talk of fallen gods, absent parents, and dissolute heroes to fuel a Greek tragedy. And ... director Zack Snyder seems convinced that that's what he's making.</Review>
            <Review>Snyder has brought a different edge to the superhero genre, one that questions what drives these men of steel and creatures of the night to do what they do and believe what they believe. There is something to admire in that.</Review>
            <Review>Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice pits the two titans against each other with beautiful visuals, too many characters, and a borderline nonsensical plot.</Review>
            <Review>The smartest thing about Zach Snyder's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) is its revisionist take on the destruction that concluded his Superman reboot Man of Steel.</Review>
            <Review>The superhero world needed better storytelling, a comic touch and more than a few rays of sunshine. The story is crippled by special effects from start to finish.</Review>
            <Review>While not the worst superhero comic book adventure ever to grace the multiplex, it's likely the most frustratingly disappointing.</Review>
            <Review>Wildly overstuffed and oddly slapdash, filled with characters and sequences that serve little purpose other than to set up a 'cinematic universe.'</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>In a sea of grimy indie Westerns, especially ones that started with the same genre canvas, "Outlaws &amp; Angels" is a thoroughly ugly example of when "Tarantino-esque" is the most generous compliment.</Review>
            <Review>Virtually every character has a dark side, and every victim has it coming. That gets old, too.</Review>
            <Review>"Outlaws and Angels" can't overcome its distractingly showy camera moves or its tendency toward scenes that drag on interminably.</Review>
            <Review>It seems another member of Clint Eastwood's brood is ready for stardom.</Review>
            <Review>"Outlaws and Angels" isn't perfect - Murray mumbles into his beard way too much - but Eastwood sure is at ease with a cowboy hat and revolver. Clearly, she's studied with the best.</Review>
            <Review>The main problem with Outlaws And Angels ... is that it lacks either a sense of authenticity or a streak of playfulness to give shape to its relentlessly ugly worldview.</Review>
            <Review>... has some evocative touches considering its shoestring budget, but little compelling drama along the way.</Review>
            <Review>Unfortunately Mollner isn't able to handle intimate, quiet scenes as well as he does action set pieces or special effects shots.</Review>
            <Review>A nasty macabre cult Western.</Review>
            <Review>Francesca Eastwood does her daddy proud as the gunslinging heroine of this bloody, revenge-fueled Western more reminiscent of a Tarantino splatterflick than one of Clint's classics.</Review>
            <Review>Lugubrious and talky, JT Mollner's debut feature is also unrelievedly nasty and absurdly pretentious.</Review>
            <Review>Mollner's delivered a strong, surprising, powerfully unsettling debut.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Today, all anybody needs to run is the determination and a pair of the right shoes. But just fifty years ago, running was viewed almost exclusively as the domain of elite male athletes who competed on tracks. With insight and propulsive energy, director Pierre Morath traces running's rise to the 1960s, examining how the liberation movements and newfound sense of personal freedom that defined the era took the sport out of the stadiums and onto the streets, and how legends like Steve Prefontaine, Fred Lebow, and Kathrine Switzer redefined running as a populist phenomenon.</StoryLine>

        <Duration>100</Duration>
        <StoryLine>When twelve ragtag teammates set out to play what should be a meaningless summer intramural baseball game, it ends up becoming the most important game of their lives. This collection of characters - the reliever turned starting pitcher (Tyler Hoechlin), a hot dog power hitter (Chace Crawford), an outfielder with anger management issues (Joe Mazzello), a player coach with clipboard envy (Duke Davis Roberts), an over-eager catcher (Ryan Pinkston), the old guy who shouldn't be playing anymore (Philip Winchester), and the guy everyone forgot was on the team (Matt Bush) - truly gives new meaning to the phrase "amateur status". As they struggle to transition away from baseball and towards an uncertain future, the best player among them (Aaron Tveit) - who they all felt should have gotten drafted - has to deal with the news that his big league dreams were dashed, leaving him grappling with why he should still play. One game can be just another box score, but when it's played by a team galvanized around the love of the game, and for the pride they have in each other, it can define a lifetime. Written and directed by Joe Mazzello ("Jurassic Park", HBO's "The Pacific", "The Social Network"), UNDRAFTED is based on the real life experiences of Joe's brother, a collegiate baseball star who was skipped over in the Major League Baseball draft.</StoryLine>

            <Review>By this point, none of the pieces fits and absolutely nothing makes any sense.</Review>
            <Review>A nightmarish landscape that's meant to be frightening - or at least unsettling - ends up being hilariously cheesy instead.</Review>
            <Review>Allegiant exemplifies what happens when a book or movie exists solely for the purposes of placating fans and maintaining a revenue stream.</Review>
            <Review>These movies were never going to transform cinema, but watching Allegiant, it's hard not to feel as if someone has pulled the rug out from under an otherwise modestly entertaining franchise.</Review>
            <Review>Allegiant aches to be a thought-provoking, moving allegory of the current world. Instead, it's an unwieldy two hours too unintentionally silly to validate how seriously it takes itself.</Review>
            <Review>Divergent feels like a hasty idea scribbled on construction paper, crumpled into a ball, and ditched in a mud puddle. Even it can't tell what it wanted to say.</Review>
            <Review>Allegiant manages to be profoundly confusing and almost entirely inert. The film's strong action sequences can't redeem a conflicting, irritating plot.</Review>
            <Review>If you thought the secret box and hidden message saga in the last Divergent movie was far-fetched then get ready for the latest outing in Veronica Roth's hit YA franchise to bamboozle you completely.</Review>
            <Review>Divergent, the Shailene Woodley-starring Games ripoff that's on film three of four, conversely ends as would a television series on the bubble -- each installment could continue on, but if for some reason it can't, the ending is satisfying enough.</Review>
            <Review>After Allegiant, some moviegoers may decide their work with this franchise is done here.</Review>
            <Review>As for the series maturing, well, Allegiant (a fancy word for 'loyal') is like man's allegiant best friend, stuck at the puppy stage--seeming so cute, but mostly just chasing its own tail, round and round, barking through the same old motions.</Review>

            <Review>It doesn't take a big budget and loads of special effects to create a genuinely scary movie. It just takes - as writer/director Jeremy Saulnier ably demonstrates in Green Room - an intriguing premise, a taut, sinewy script and a solid cast.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Miracles from Heaven makes the most out of an outstanding performance from Jennifer Garner, but it isn't quite enough to keep this faith-based drama from preaching to the choir.</StoryLine>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>You can't endear when you're subtly insulting, and Miracles From Heaven's otherwise good intentions are lost in its confusing mix of uplifting spirituality and judgment.</Review>
            <Review>It is a movie by believers, about believers, for believers, to the exclusion of all else, custom-tailored for private church-group showings.</Review>
            <Review>Riggen has no shame when it comes to jerking the tears, and sometimes her manipulations work even on the hardest of hearts... One thing she should probably work on is the comedy.</Review>
            <Review>It's a good Christian film that plays to its audience and preaches the importance of neighborly values.</Review>
            <Review>The question is never what will happen to 10-year-old Anna (Kylie Rogers), who suffers a bloated belly and chronic pain. The only issue is how long she, and the audience, will have to wait to find out.</Review>
            <Review>Miracles from Heaven wrings this story for everything it's worth, and is ultimately saved from mawkishness by the utter believability of Garner's performance as a mother who would do anything to save her daughter.</Review>
            <Review>Miracles From Heaven aims for faith-based audiences, and its narrow focus keeps the film's message of possibility and positivity from wider viewers.</Review>
            <Review>Believers and fans of uplifting, unashamedly emotional stories will enjoy this. Non-believers will struggle with the message and tone.</Review>
            <Review>Engaging performances certainly broaden its appeal, especially from the younger members of the cast. But as you might guess from the title, it's totally preaching to the converted.</Review>
            <Review>Though unquestionably a film of faith, Miracles from Heaven doesn't ram its religiosity down your throat quite as much as many others of its kind do. Not until a horribly over-fluffy finale, that is.</Review>
            <Review>What a strange film.</Review>
            <Review>To have it suddenly blatantly preach to the converted and to the converted alone is a missed opportunity of massive proportions, making watching Miracles from Heaven at all a serious waste of time.</Review>

            <Review>The easiest way to describe "My Golden Days" is as a coming-of-age romance, but Arnaud Desplechin's film, with its memories and carefully nursed grudges and moments of heartbreak and betrayal, feels weightier than that.</Review>
            <Review>The details - some funny, some intensely painful - of Paul and Esther's relationship over the years have a cumulative power that isn't diminished by a few loose ends.</Review>
            <Review>Desplechin draws uniformly superb performances from his young cast, making the coming-of-age genre seem fresh and vital.</Review>
            <Review>While the ghosts of teen romances past no doubt hover over many of us, after a while you might find yourself wanting to slap Paul Dedalus across the face.</Review>

            <Review>The joke is belaboured and the larger point a bit unclear.</Review>
            <Review>The scenario is airtight - faked archival footage is brilliant - but the story might have worked better as a thriller like Logan's Run or Children of Men.</Review>
            <Review>The gags, many of which come packaged with the premise, largely fall flat. For all the thought put into No Men, it still feels more like the makings of some solid sketch comedy than a feature film.</Review>
            <Review>With such a compelling premise, the film definitely keeps your interest and is at times very smart, but it just misses.</Review>
            <Review>Combined with some stiff performances (even for fake talking heads), it's hard not to feel like No Men Beyond This Point is just one long "men are from Mars, women be shopping" joke.</Review>
            <Review>Led by Kristine Cofsky, the large cast is good at being deadpan. Then again, there's not much life to this movie.</Review>

            <Review>[Linklater's] light touch remains a marvel. Though his characters are often just bouncing from conversation to conversation, night out to night out, the film's direction is never lackadaisical.</Review>
            <Review>Imagine "Porky's" as an intelligent character study and you're on the right path.</Review>
            <Review>Another love letter to the magic hour of adolescence from director Richard Linklater.</Review>
            <Review>Can only be described in the same way you might talk about college jocks -- attractive, dumb and charming, against your better judgment.</Review>
            <Review>Although this may be "lesser" Linklater, it's still more enjoyable than a lot of what's currently available in theaters.</Review>
            <Review>What everybody wants in Everybody Wants Some!! is not just sex and success on the field. It's what we all want. It's time.</Review>
            <Review>Frat-boy jocks usually get a bad rap in movies (filmmakers tend not to be former jocks). Yet Linklater captures his characters' bantering camaraderie and boozy machismo with disarming sympathy.</Review>
            <Review>Everybody Wants Some, like Dazed and Confused, feels like having old friends over, listening to records &amp; reminiscing.</Review>
            <Review>Films about brotherhood come in many forms, yet rare do they capture the connection of different personalities with the engrossing, free spirited tone that Linklater does here.</Review>
            <Review>Linklater offers astute observations about college life and young adults exploring their first taste of independence while reminding us that there's more on their minds than just getting some!!</Review>
            <Review>Linklater proves his skills directing actors. Everyone is great in the film. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>It is deliciously funny and moving. It is also profoundly about why people perform and create art. And it is heartbreakingly accurate about actors and the theatre.</Review>
            <Review>It's delightful and winning, both sad and funny and touching on so many levels. Welcome this little gem into your arms if you can.</Review>
            <Review>It is, it really is, just as magnificent, powerful and enthralling as you would imagine. Yet to assume the greatness of The Dresser based on the simply sum of its parts is to miss the whole point of the story.</Review>
            <Review>Of course, it's a showcase of great acting, as you would expect, but The Dresser is also a well-tailored play enriched by layers of metaphor and irony.</Review>
            <Review>The Dresser rises and falls on the strength of its central duo, and it's hard to imagine two currently working actors who could rival Courtenay and Finney as well as McKellen and Hopkins do.</Review>
            <Review>Seeing these actors together is wonderful. If there is an edge, it goes to Mr. McKellen, whose scurrying, effeminate Norman is a study in subordination and repressed emotion.</Review>
            <Review>While The Dresser may have ups and downs in its narrative, there's no denying that Sir Anthony Hopkins and Sir Ian McKellen deliver stunning performances that alone make the film worth seeing.</Review>
            <Review>Thoughtful and thrilling in spite of its modest external appearances, The Dresser finds two of our finest thespians at the peak of their powers.</Review>
            <Review>The crisp bite of Harwood's lines (goosed here and there by snippets of Shakespeare) and the vigorous enthusiasm of Hopkins and McKellen give The Dresser an engaging passion.</Review>
            <Review>It's easy to understand why an actor of a certain age would rush to sign on for The Dresser.</Review>
            <Review>When a production features Ian McKellen, Anthony Hopkins, Emily Watson, and Sarah Lancashire from Happy Valley, great expectations are quite in order. I was not disappointed.</Review>
            <Review>While the visual presentation of "The Dresser" may be somewhat lacking in sparks, it more than makes up for that with the undeniably fiery and entertaining turns from both Hopkins and McKellen.</Review>

            <Review>Like most of the indispensable Jia's work, this triptych film, which jumps from 1999 to 2014 and then to 2025, is intimately engaged in the push-pull between tradition and progress.</Review>
            <Review>Director Jia Zhangke offers a work of poetic prophecy in this romantic and political melodrama.</Review>
            <Review>Jia's languid style and exquisite framing complement his understated approach to the material, which opts for depth over melodrama. But "Mountains May Depart" is grounded in Zhao's delicate performance, which is her best.</Review>
            <Review>There's a lot of heart here.</Review>
            <Review>Impressive production values but muddled impact.</Review>
            <Review>Zhao Tao's awe-inspiring performance and the pure audacity of director Jia Zhangke make Mountains May Depart the auteur's best effort to date.</Review>

            <Review>The film inspires almost no feeling at all - even the Friday the 13th movies bother giving the bad guy a backstory.</Review>
            <Review>An effective variation on stalker/home-invasion thriller themes.</Review>
            <Review>Be prepared to be royally creeped out ... an exceedingly rude comment on the current real estate scene ... Archembault's sicko landlord belongs in the same fright gallery as Dieter Laser.</Review>
            <Review>13 Cameras is far from a flawless movie, but it's a pleasant surprise and should do well to establish Zarcoff as an emerging filmmaker -- especially of the horror genre -- to watch.</Review>
            <Review>It doesn't so much remake formula as tweak it, but despite a few serious logical lapses down the stretch, Zarcoff's slow-burning debut generates some genuine chills.</Review>
            <Review>The throwaway grimness of the film's final scene is genuinely chilling.</Review>
            <Review>13 Cameras delivers a villain for the ages, but the rest of the film can't keep up.</Review>
            <Review>It's got a very clear agenda and sets about delivering on that goal precisely. It's way more sure of itself than the movies with more spectacle, and I'll take overall tone over sporadic moments any time.</Review>
            <Review>13 Cameras is the kind of thing that messes with your mind and starts to do some damage.</Review>
            <Review>Generic exploitation thriller that isn't exploitative enough.</Review>
            <Review>Everything here is unnerving and uncomfortable to watch - and that sense of amplified discomfort naturally extends to include an eleventh-hour shift in tone from harrowing psychodrama to black comedy.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Few things in life are more depressing than being stuck in a hopeless, dead-end job at a mattress store in a decaying urban strip mall. Native to this environment and products of outdated pop culture are Rob (Mark Greenfield) and Manny (Coolio), the unsuccessful, unrefined and uncouth sales force behind Affordable Mattress. The pair spend their days at Affordable Mattress, shifting around unsold inventory, taking smoke breaks, washing windows, and middling with employees from other stores in the strip mall. The story resembles a Bartleby of sorts, but absent Paul Scofield is the store's irritable manager Preston (Kenneth McGregor), the comic relief who relieves his endless frustration with verbal abuse bluntly aimed at his miserable employees. How they remain employed is anyone's guess, which forms the parallel to the Herman Melville story. Desperate to improve sales, Preston hires a pretty woman named Isabelle (RocÔøΩo Verdejo) to help sell mattresses. Isabelle turns out to be just what the enterprise needs to stay afloat, and quickly makes friends with Manny, Rob and Martin (C. Clayton Blackwell), the dim-witted gift shop attendant who works next door. The seemingly charming Isabelle, however, sells not only mattresses but also a scheme to her three new friends that offers them the hope of an exit from the monotonous life they have known for so long - murder her ex-husband and make it look like an accident so that she can collect a $200,000 life insurance payout, which she will split with them. Together, the team comes up with a plan that, when set in motion, would make even Harry and Lloyd from Dumb and Dumber proud, and go about accomplishing the task at hand with not an ounce more competence than what goes into their daily routine at Affordable Mattress.</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>You beat the weight or the weight beats you--it's the test every powerlifter faces when approaching the bar. But the weight that's been pressing down on coach and gym owner Paul Steinman is something far more challenging than sport. Bombing out on his squats at the 2012 American Open was just one more failure for Paul. It had been a bad stretch both in and out of the gym but it was nobody's business and so Paul didn't talk about it. But now it's time to make good and that's why, one year later, he's back at the same place, competing in the same meet. As a super heavyweight, Paul lifts in the day's final flight, so there's time to sit and think about all that's happened. What do you do when the weight feels heavy? Can you get up? A dramatic, character-driven documentary set in Brooklyn, Weight follows Paul and his wife Rebecca over a difficult year.</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>Glen Dunzweiler was faced with the threat of losing his home. Suddenly, a life that seemed reserved only for the mentally ill and drug addicted felt closer than he had ever imagined. This realization led him to question, what is it like to be homeless in the United States? With only his production equipment, a car, and some bare essentials, Glen set out across America to discover what led people to a life on the street, what daily life was like for them, and what they had to do to survive. In order to better understand the homeless and the service providers he would interview, Glen chose to live virtually down-and-out by sticking to a minimal budget and sleeping only in his car or on a friendly couch when he could find one. Glen quickly experienced the desperation, irritability, and the instability that comes from going without the things we take for granted. Glen discovers that homelessness is unbiased and could happen to anyone without a support network to fall back on. By traveling the country and speaking with destitute men and women, Glen confirms that homeless people are people first, and deserve not our pity, but our respect and our help.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Curtis is 100-per-cent watchable as a puffy, mumbling shuffler whose chess lessons double as life strategies.</Review>
            <Review>"Dark Horse" falls into the formula of underprivileged kids challenging the elites at their own game. But the outcome is never certain.</Review>
            <Review>"The Dark Horse" isn't always easy to watch, but Curtis's quietly powerful presence makes it worthwhile.</Review>
            <Review>Curtis' portrayal of Gen's ever-present, invasive mental illness isn't mere window dressing and lacks showboating. The camera hugs his meltdowns with an uncomfortable perseverance as he talks to himself, hallucinates and turns manic.</Review>
            <Review>The film never shies away from the hard topics, and the actors bring nuance and heart to this intensely dramatic and affecting film.</Review>
            <Review>There are heroes to root for in "The Dark Horse," and you'll feel mostly good about humanity walking out the door.</Review>
            <Review>A hugely chunked-up Curtis, a Kiwi actor who's worked all over the world but returned home to star in and help produce Robertson's film, is masterly here.</Review>
            <Review>This year, Disney bypassed the feel-good sports movie, and luckily for U.S. audiences, we got a smaller but better version with The Dark Horse.</Review>
            <Review>A great, deeply affecting movie.</Review>

            <Review>Toggling between the breathtaking Peruvian highlands and the busy clamor of Lima, "The Debt" places three very different lives on a collision course freighted with moral and financial complexity.</Review>
            <Review>Barney Elliott's The Debt deals in murky ethics and exploitation in this well-acted trio of connecting stories set in Peru.</Review>
            <Review>Despite its best efforts to be thought-provoking, the film is dramatically inert, slow and its revelations aren't all that politically illuminating, relying on coincidence and worn tropes to obfuscate its lack of ingenuity.</Review>
            <Review>The result is well meaning, well shot (especially the rural scenes) and well acted (you can't go wrong with David Strathairn), but ultimately a dramatic disappointment.</Review>
            <Review>[Director] Elliott clearly cares about the exploitation of Latin American resources by rapacious foreign corporations, but his characters are one-dimensional mouthpieces for whatever point he wants to make in a given scene.</Review>

            <Review>The 1980s in southern India receive affectionate reimagining in Brahman Naman, a coming-of-age-comedy about sex-obsessed college students and their quest to lose their virginity.</Review>
            <Review>Diverting if seldom hilarious.</Review>
            <Review>Proves to be more layered than its promises of shenanigans may expect, especially as this is the rare sex comedy that doesn't glorify the male gaze.</Review>
            <Review>It's about as much fun as it can be watching a gaggle of undergrads getting drunk again and again and again.</Review>
            <Review>Brahman Naman is like a crispy Samosa with nothing at the center. The Netflix release pays homage to American sex comedies from Porky's and Revenge of the Nerds to There's Something About Mary, but lacks the heart to go along with the excess of raunch.</Review>
            <Review>here's fun internal bickering among the lads, mostly about bovine sex, but what writer Naman Ramachandran best captures is the sexist, selfish creed to which the groups at hand subscribe.</Review>
            <Review>It's like that childhood friend of yours that kept giving you the most disgusting dares in a round of truth or dare, mocking you for not having the courage to follow through.</Review>
            <Review>Visually stunning with a script that fluctuates between cringe-worthy and comical.</Review>
            <Review>What is most enchanting about the film is how the very auteur-like Q uses his very distinctive filmmaking style to serve the comically rich but intellectually dense screenplay, instead of trying to topple it with his characteristic hyperactiveness.</Review>
            <Review>Perhaps if it was better fleshed out, the film could have been a sparkling comedy. But despite all the sexual suggestiveness and jokes, it just doesn't rise to the occasion.</Review>
            <Review>It is very invigorating to see that contemporary filmmakers are opening up conversations in popular culture that go beyond the commercial concerns, and are urging people to think.</Review>
            <Review>What drove me to distraction, however, was the constant, aggressive stupidity -- the feeling that no gag was too ridiculous, no double entendre too tawdry, to merit inclusion.</Review>

            <Review>It's a fascinating experiment, and proof that Jolie truly has directorial chops and an extraordinary eye for imagery.</Review>
            <Review>The actors aren't unhinged enough for the scathing conceit, and the script is more of a mechanism than a revelation.</Review>
            <Review>The point to all this seems to be life is cruel and people are jerks, but sometimes very good-looking jerks. Deep.</Review>
            <Review>What are the artistic purposes for this tedious collection of frowning, drinking, bickering, peeping and smoking scenes? "By the Sea" is long on perverse images but short on ideas.</Review>
            <Review>Pitt invests the vague, cranky relationship with his usual intelligence and restraint, but the movie is destined to rank with such celebrity-couple fiascos as Gigli (2003) and Shanghai Surprise (1986).</Review>
            <Review>It's very, very slow, with probably only 20 minutes in a two-plus-hour movie in which something could be said to be happening.</Review>
            <Review>There is no doubt that this drama is a half-hour too long and slow-moving, but Jolie and Pitt do some of their best work in scenes here -- and they don't hold back.</Review>
            <Review>For those of you who complain about the multiplex offering nothing of substance for adult audiences, this is a grand opportunity for you to put your money where your mouth is.</Review>
            <Review>Might truly be the most narcissistic vanity project of all time.</Review>
            <Review>Jolie-Pitt, as director, is wading into the territory of Antonioni's bourgeois disaffection... But it takes much more than this to make art out of inertia.</Review>
            <Review>There's something unshakable about it, and something remarkable about the fact that it exists at all.</Review>
            <Review>By The Sea is not exempt of merit, but it's accosted by that commonly made critique that is never quite as clear as it is here: It's preoccupied with style over substance. [Full Review in Spanish]</Review>

            <Review>Sadly, the movie is a snooze, but see it just for the magnificent Hiddleston, who honors Williams' greatness but also wriggles beyond it.</Review>
            <Review>Hiddleston is compelling as Williams, the king of hillbilly music, noting that when he finds a note he's fond of, "I like to hang on to it." One might say the same about director Abraham.</Review>
            <Review>Hiddleston's uncanny musical performances, all filmed live, help redeem a movie that exhibits the flawed brilliance of its subject.</Review>
            <Review>Saw the Light is not a movie that ever catches fire. One hopes the story will be told again, with more emphasis on what went on inside Hank Williams than on what went on around him.</Review>
            <Review>There's some drinkin', some cheatin', some yellin', and some cryin'. But there ain't nothin' here that explains why, as Williams tells us, all kinds of people write to him just to share their troubles.</Review>
            <Review>Tom Hiddleston puts in a performance as Williams that ranks with that of Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash in "I Walk the Line." And Hiddleston gets to do it in a better movie.</Review>
            <Review>Hank Williams was a musical colossus and his story is remarkable and fascinating. But you wouldn't think so from this dull and largely charmless film. What a shame.</Review>
            <Review>It's worth watching for Hiddleston's performance, but Williams fans won't find much to love.</Review>
            <Review>The story covers a lot of loving, leaving, hurting and cheating. There are evocative sequences, but the overall narrative is listless and often falls into Walk Hard-style musical biopic clich√©s.</Review>
            <Review>Instead of exploring the darkness of the main character, it stays on superficial elements and never really goes deep. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director Marc Abraham gets ambitious with this biopic about iconic country music star Hank Williams, but the film is far too choppy to provide much insight.</Review>
            <Review>Bleak biopics don't have to be grim (think of Raging Bull). But this one is neither illuminating nor able to make the most of the dark.</Review>

        <Title>A Sinner in Mecca</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2015</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>79</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Here, we enter the city of Mecca that has been forbidden to non-Muslims for 14 centuries. For gay filmmaker Parvez Sharma, filming in Saudi Arabia presents two serious challenges -- filming is forbidden in the country and homosexuality is punishable by death. He ends up documenting his journey on nothing more than an iPhone and two smuggled, tiny cameras. On these never-before-filmed streets of ancient Mecca, he joins 4 million Muslims, from the majority, peace-loving pilgrims fulfilling a lifelong calling, to brutal jihadists for whom violence is a creed. They have all entered Mecca for the world's largest pilgrimage: the Hajj. Sharma yearns to find his own place within an Islam he has always known, an Islam that bears no resemblance to the bastardized versions creating havoc around the Muslim world.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Many aspects of A Sinner in Mecca are fraught...so why does it seldom feel like a matter of life or death?</Review>
            <Review>My true frustration about Sharma's film is that beneath the diversions, it contains the material for what could have been something as controversial, powerful, and tender as he seemed to wish.</Review>
            <Review>Mr. Sharma has created a swirling, fascinating travelogue and a stirring celebration of devotion.</Review>
            <Review>The mix of ancient customs and modern crowd-control methods is both inspiring and surprising, and an absolute must-see for any student of sociology or religion.</Review>
            <Review>Sharma's vital, personal doc reveals the filmmaker's attempt at hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca that it is the duty of Muslims to undertake once in a lifetime.</Review>
            <Review>The result is a fascinating look at a city off-limits to non-Muslims.</Review>
            <Review>You will see never-before-filmed images of Muslim observances in this sincere, but at times self-indulgent, gay director's journey back to his spiritual roots.</Review>
            <Review>What the film lacks in narrative unity and aesthetic splendor it makes up in moral grandeur and ethical purpose.</Review>
            <Review>This notable feat of cinematography shows much the world Islam's holy city of Mecca but is more of the inner journey of a gay Muslim than it is a travelogue.</Review>
            <Review>Shots of the masses of pilgrims are spectacular, especially those of the millions circling the Kaaba, one of five required rituals, but the emotional core of the film is what stands out: Sharma's identity crisis as a devout gay Muslim.</Review>
            <Review>It touches on a number of the central conflicts in contemporary Islam (and in religion more widely) but does so in a way that invites reflection rather than getting people's backs up.</Review>
            <Review>Powerful examination by a gay Muslim about the conflict between sexual identity and spirituality, reminiscent in many ways of "Trembling before G-D", the documentary about Jews similarly conflicted</Review>

            <Review>Mr. Elliott's story is not helped by James Franco, who plays him with his usual smug catatonia.</Review>
            <Review>"The Adderall Diaries" is a complex, absorbing, at times profound look at how we choose to remember our past.</Review>
            <Review>All affect and no personality.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director Pamela Romanowsky, in her first feature, captures both fireworks and tragedy in go-for-broke scenes between Franco and Harris.</Review>
            <Review>The Adderall Diaries is about nothing but itself. It's not fiction, it's forgery. It's not adaptation, it's erasure.</Review>
            <Review>The Adderall Diaries comes across as an incomplete jumble of colliding plot lines.</Review>
            <Review>... feels a little self-impressed and student-filmy, yet it allows its cast a few highlight reel moments.</Review>
            <Review>A dumb adaptation of Stephen Elliott's memoir about (among other things) writer's block, a murder trial, and S&amp;M sex. James Franco looks stupefied in the lead role, and the film's point remains murky throughout.</Review>
            <Review>Romanowsky attempts too much, and winds up succeeding in very little.</Review>
            <Review>"The Adderall Diaries" never commits to any of these paths in a convincing way - the true-crime saga in particular feels bizarrely tacked-on, as if Elliott was taking a break in the middle of his emotional turmoil to watch an episode of "Law &amp; Order."</Review>
            <Review>There are scattered subplots that never truly come together as a cohesive whole. It's a labor of love that doesn't successfully do its source material justice.</Review>
            <Review>The Adderall Diaries starts as a drama about a bad case of writer's block before it morphs into an essay on the unreliable nature of memory and perception, then becomes a testimonial to the power of forgiveness -- without ever mentioning it.</Review>

            <Review>Bateman and Nicole Kidman, too old to convincingly pull off this sibling pair, would have fared better as the parents.</Review>
            <Review>"The Family Fang" is kind of messy but also fun and touching; it's a definite step forward for Bateman as a director ...</Review>
            <Review>Bateman knows his fractured family well, but "Fang" doesn't give him enough to chew on. The characters are all scarred, but the film doesn't leave a mark.</Review>
            <Review>It's heavy stuff, served with a light touch.</Review>
            <Review>Fang is directed by Bateman with a sensitivity that the story's sour whimsy doesn't quite deserve.</Review>
            <Review>Even when The Family Fang stretches credulity, we stay with it. Bateman knows how to tell a story.</Review>
            <Review>Laced with subtle performances and rich characters, Jason Bateman's The Family Fang is a big improvement over his last movie, the overly cynical-but-cute Bad Words.</Review>
            <Review>This offbeat dysfunctional family saga sidesteps clich√©s with its tale of adult children trying to escape the past.</Review>
            <Review>Filmed with an economic focus on revealing character details, and lit in shadowy brown tones that reflect the inner darkness surrounding these siblings, "The Family Fang" grounds itself in the emotional truths of their states of mind.</Review>
            <Review>... Bateman proves his direction as remarkable at the very least, giving the drama and comedy film a suspenseful and skeptically ominous feeling ...</Review>
            <Review>[The] attempted vulnerability feels somewhat hollow ... there's no side to take.</Review>

            <Review>You've already seen most of what Chow and his seven(!) co-screenwriters have crafted, and you've usually seen it with greater coherence and more impressive CGI.</Review>
            <Review>In The Mermaid, Chow never forgets that the camera is the funniest tool at his disposal, and the only one that speaks in a language that everyone can understand.</Review>
            <Review>I had a really good time.</Review>
            <Review>Chow and his army of writers (seriously, it took nine people to write this) get terrific support from a strong cast of regulars and newcomers who really sell the story, cheesy special effects aside.</Review>
            <Review>Like an ecological Lust, Caution, this contempo fairy tale about a mermaid who falls for the evil developer she's been sent to seduce and assassinate is strikingly relevant to China</Review>
            <Review>Crass and macabre, yet big-hearted, it makes a wonderfully adult bedtime story.</Review>
            <Review>Chow habitu√©s will be primed for hyperbolic acting, ludicrous wirework, ugly CGI and outlandish action sequences. Rest assured, those points will be satisfied.</Review>
            <Review>Chow cares mostly about Liu and Shan's love story - how their spiritual lives transcend their class differences. Yet, Chow balances romantic concerns with the sociological message. Most American films today...work backwards.</Review>
            <Review>Demonstrates Chow's innate understanding of the physics of humor better than anything he's made since perhaps 2001's Shaolin Soccer.</Review>
            <Review>It offers a visual reprieve from the cumbersomely mechanized aesthetic of so much contemporary fantasy.</Review>
            <Review>Despite the save- the-earth memo, this is very much a Stephen Chow-directed work and that means ludicrous situations and nonsensical jokes.</Review>
            <Review>Chow sat in the director's chair but doesn't star in the film... yet we have here all of Chow's comedic trademarks: the downright silliness, the outrageous humour bordering on juvenilia, the long digressions, even the dubious treatment of women.</Review>

            <Review>Some of the films are haunting, some of them more macabre, but all of them play with holiday symbolism in way that will make viewers rethink a lot of their favorite celebrations.</Review>
            <Review>"Holidays" is frustrating because its creators all have something good going for them, but almost consistently have no ideas of what to do.</Review>
            <Review>The film mostly feels perfunctory and awkward - like calling home at Christmas.</Review>
            <Review>Like a family dinner with an eccentric uncle, Holidays' quirkiness is fitfully entertaining, but ultimately exhausting.</Review>
            <Review>Seeing how visionaries new and old foster an idea of things that go bump in the night is what keeps viewers coming back for more, and when anthologies add as many twists as Holidays, aficionados are always ready for the next installment.</Review>
            <Review>A typically erratic horror anthology...</Review>
            <Review>A series of stupid, baffling, and pointless horror segments that go nowhere...</Review>
            <Review>Murder, paranormal pregnancies, and damn creepy kids dominate the octaptych, the parts of which waver between clever -- if not straight up unnerving -- and banal.</Review>
            <Review>Every single segment in Holidays is of a certain quality and every single one holds your attention. Some are just more refined and impactful than others.</Review>
            <Review>As is (almost) always the case with anthology films, Holidays is best described as a "mixed bag." And yet it's the wildly different collection of tones, attitudes, and storytelling styles that makes the collection so interesting.</Review>
            <Review>It's a middle-of-the-road anthology but boasts great energy and a sense of humor that runs throughout, helping make even the mediocre entries watchable.</Review>
            <Review>Horror anthologies thrive on bringing a lot of different things to the table...but if there's one thing they shouldn't be, it's boring. And for seven out of eight of these, I was just plain bored.</Review>

            <Review>Combining rowdy concert footage and revealing offstage interactions of the band members, "Mad Tiger" is a well-executed portrait of a band coming apart at the seams.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is obviously heartfelt, but the directors, Jonathan Yi and Michael Haertlein, never turn this motley crew into compelling characters.</Review>
            <Review>This aptly colorful documentary doesn't provide all that much insight into the act's history, and the human conflicts aren't fully illuminated, either. But it's fun entering these performers' universe even with a less than all-access pass.</Review>
            <Review>In this uncritical look at the group and its music, directors Jonathan Yi and Michael Haertlein put the focus on the standard reality-TV repertoire like "Making the Band."</Review>
            <Review>Yellow and Red in particular don't hesitate to show that there's real pain behind their personas. Some costumes are for fun, but others are uniforms projecting a level of self-confidence that otherwise wouldn't exist.</Review>
            <Review>An evocative portrait of strained friendships and creative turmoil.</Review>
            <Review>Mad Tiger is an incomplete character portrait that coasts on the idea that the band's crazy antics are compelling enough to fill out a feature runtime.</Review>
            <Review>Let's face it, the music is awful, but the inter-personal drama and backstage dynamics ensure Mad Tiger is a tense, at times sad peek inside the ego and ambition that motivates the artist.</Review>
            <Review>The whole thing boils down to Hioki's ego, and watching a 45-year-old musician trying to keep his band together becomes a bit taxing.</Review>
            <Review>Mad Tiger achieves a tricky balance: It captures how Peelander-Z can generate authentic fun at their shows while suffering turmoil from the personalities within.</Review>

            <Review>Even if you invite a lot of talented people to the set, the result won't work if you don't give them a way to show why they're considered talented.</Review>
            <Review>This spectacularly dumb and unfunny film will likely bore even the staunchest fans of the "Hangover" movies, of which "Search" is a kind of distant, fatally impoverished cousin.</Review>
            <Review>It's just not very funny.</Review>
            <Review>"Search Party" is a pedal-to-the-metal road trip that aims for spontaneity, but stays within the lines-even when it goes off on wacky tangents, there's never any doubt what direction it's actually headed.</Review>
            <Review>This is safe, hyper-conventional stuff, lazy enough to make you feel bad that Middleditch had to go nude for it. The best thing you can say about the movie is that men have taken their pants off for less.</Review>
            <Review>[An] entirely generic gross-out comedy.</Review>
            <Review>"Search Party" isn't completely without laughs, but a toxic cloud of sameness hangs over the feature, which wheezes from incident to incident, failing to build momentum through limp shock value.</Review>
            <Review>[I]n its sitcom-like fratty humor, its waste of talented female performers ... in its sheer laziness and lack of originality, it feels like a throwback less to 2013 than to the 1990s.</Review>
            <Review>This is the type of comedy where the flop sweat is nearly always present as each player tries to lift the comedy, only to tragically belly-flop over and over.</Review>
            <Review>Men behave like immature boys in raunchy comedy.</Review>
            <Review>Search Party is a waste of funny people who are given silly, unfunny things to do.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately, charm is not enough to gloss over the clich√©d story, which may entertain for the short running time, but is about seven years too late to take anyone by surprise.</Review>

            <Review>The movie is shamelessly manipulative on several levels, and the cast members do their respective bits effectively.</Review>
            <Review>Rescue-dog purists may not approve of the line "The Dog Lover" takes, yet to this dog lover it comes off as compassionate and realistic: a plea for a place where good care can become common sense.</Review>
            <Review>The film's prevailing theme may be that nothing is black and white, but the execution ... proves spottier than a kennel full of caged Dalmatians.</Review>
            <Review>Heavy-handed drama is well-acted but manipulative.</Review>
            <Review>At best, The Dog Lover is like a bad Hallmark Channel or Lifetime movie, so bland and vanilla it would be inhumane to canines to call it a "dog" of a movie.</Review>
            <Review>The Dog Lover looks less like a cheesy drama destined for the Lifetime Channel than it does a piece of anti-government propaganda. In this movie at least, the businessman is the underdog.</Review>

            <Review>Abreu's visionary movie is a restless and dynamic creature that is forever reconstituting itself into complex visual and musical landscapes.</Review>
            <Review>Although the film is a bit abstract and largely free of dialogue (what little speaking there is is a whispered babble of tongues), it has a universal simplicity-we're seeing life through the wide, innocent eyes of a naif.</Review>
            <Review>Abreu handcrafted his images, and the imagination from which those images spring is astonishingly fertile.</Review>
            <Review>The little boy here... is one of the most distinctive and adorable animated characters you'll ever come across, and his introduction to "the world out there" is a moving revelation indeed.</Review>
            <Review>This magical Brazilian fantasy by Al√™ Abreu reminded me of Nina Paley's Sita Sings the Blues and Tomm Moore's The Secret of Kells in its crafty combination of simply drawn characters (the boy) and ornate geometrical patterns (the world).</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director Ale Abreu's use (sparing but striking) of the blank-page aesthetic makes the frequent, lavish splashes of kaleidoscopic color all the more interesting.</Review>
            <Review>...the Brazilian film Boy &amp; the World by the director Al√™ Abreu... reminds you of what can be accomplished in this medium.</Review>
            <Review>he Brazilian fable Boy and the World, one of this year's Oscar nominees in the Animated Feature category, is a stirring blend of gorgeous animation and a simple, heartfelt story.</Review>
            <Review>A dazzler, with enough far-out 'head trip' moments to have qualified it for cult status during the era of the midnight-movie illegal smile.</Review>
            <Review>Kaleidoscopic in its opening up of brilliant color and of the troubling interaction between corporate "people" and flesh-and-bone people, between the environment and civilization.</Review>
            <Review>Ale Abreu's animated film feels like a child's crayon drawing that was stuck to the fridge with a magnet that was somehow brought to life, set free into the world, and stumbled onto an adventure that is unlike anything you've ever seen or heard.</Review>
            <Review>Boy and the World is the animated Playtime that you never knew you wanted.</Review>

It's 2012 and Barr, fed up with corporate influence in politics, takes matters into her own hands when she launches a third party presidential bid founded on grassroots activism. Hitting the campaign trail, the sarcastic, opinionated, and outspoken Barr makes for a candidate unlike any other as she brings her message to the people. Featuring appearances from Michael Moore, Sandra Bernhard, Rosie O'Donnell, and others close to Barr, Roseanne for President! is both a rousing David vs. Goliath tale and a revealing portrait of a cultural icon.</StoryLine>

            <Review>A climax so dark you'll need braille subtitles to get through it.</Review>
            <Review>Equally inspired by Quentin Tarantino, the Coen brothers and the seediest of '70s drive-in exploitation, "Carnage Park" is a frequently repellent film that's nonetheless cleverly constructed.</Review>
            <Review>Even at just 80 minutes, the story is stretched too thin.</Review>
            <Review>"Carnage Park" is an extremely empty experience.</Review>
            <Review>Mickey Keating takes the adage "less is more" to heart in his "Carnage Park," and it pays off pretty well.</Review>
            <Review>Visually, it's well done, as is Gino Ostinelli's score (as opposed to the pop soundtrack, which can feel derivative). And Keating keeps the story tight, giving the audience enough twists and turns to keep the ride fun.</Review>
            <Review>Mickey Keating has chomped down on a big slab of 1970s grindhouse meat and spat out Carnage Park, a grizzled B-movie crime-gone-awry blue plate special.</Review>
            <Review>The film covers The Texas Chainsaw Massacre by way of Rob Zombie, Quentin Tarantino, and Ti West.</Review>
            <Review>Keating's work continues to improve, with Carnage Park suggesting that he's more than ready to tackle bigger and lengthier shoots - if he chooses.</Review>
            <Review>With a sense of swagger and an unflinching pace, Carnage Park is truly a cinematic triumph from top to bottom.</Review>
            <Review>Carnage Park is an exploitation movie down to its very bones, but writer-director Mickey Keating never really finds a handle on which sort of throwback film he wants to make.</Review>
            <Review>[If] Sam Peckinpah, John Boorman, or Arthur Penn ever opted to direct a low-budget 1978 horror flick, it might look a little like Carnage Park.</Review>

            <Review>Essential viewing for any fantasy film fans.</Review>
            <Review>A continual delight.</Review>
            <Review>While a little light and fluffy - and not offering much insight or info that hasn't been covered in the numerous books on Harryhausen - it's a wonderful celebration of his work.</Review>

            <Review>The most fascinating point made in the film is that it was Harryhausen who invented the way we all think dinosaurs moved. Those gestures - adopted as truth even by palaeontologists - first came from him.</Review>

            <Review>So vividly immersive is Kung Fu Panda 3 - so vibrant, so tactile - it will make you feel as if you've stepped into a fully realized world. And then once you've stepped out, you'll be craving dumplings.</Review>
            <Review>The new sequel lacks the tear-jerking revelations and darker edge that characterized its predecessor. Visually though, it's a candy-colored 3-D treat, from the exquisite sunset that shimmers over the panda enclave to the psychedelia of the spirit world.</Review>
            <Review>With a star-studded voice cast (Black in the lead, with Rogen and Cross on backup) there's no shortage of humor. But the animation is the real standout in the film.</Review>
            <Review>I think the secret to the appeal of the entire Kung Fu Panda franchise is the enormous affection we feel for Po, that seemingly bumbling good guy who also can rise to the occasion and showcase true heroism and mystical power.</Review>
            <Review>Another successful entry in this dependably smart and well-crafted franchise for kids.</Review>
            <Review>Kids, especially those who enjoyed the previous Kung Fu Panda movies, will appreciate what the third movie has to offer.</Review>
            <Review>Kung Fu Panda 3 revisits the same themes as its predecessors ... But that familiarity doesn't lessen the film's emotional impact and solid laughs.</Review>
            <Review>It's hard to be cynical about Kung Fu Panda 3-it's part of a series that is so good-hearted and fun and it clocks in at a loose 90.</Review>
            <Review>A moving character study and an exciting action-adventure-comedy, and it is also desperately gorgeous.</Review>
            <Review>From the colourful, psychedelic realm of the spirits to the playground-like panda kingdom, the art here is stylish and arresting.</Review>
            <Review>A cynical cherry-picked mish-mash of China's spiritual treasures for Hollywood's bottom line, rather than the sincere children's bedtime story it should be? It's still good.</Review>
            <Review>One of the most pleasing franchises in animation, Po and his stalwart companions mix Western and Eastern tropes together to create a pleasing amalgam with some of the industry's best animation, both traditional and modern.</Review>

            <Review>2016's first wholly unexpected piece of entertaining brain food.</Review>
            <Review>To their enormous credit, director Gavin Hood and writer Guy Hibbert offer no easy answers and take no easy outs, electing instead to keep viewers as conflicted and uncomfortable as the characters on the screen.</Review>
            <Review>This tale is intriguingly structured and expertly executed, and wholeheartedly embraces the moral complexities of one of the most divisive issues of modern military combat.</Review>

            <Review>This painfully unfunny dysfunctional family comedy is like an acid flashback to a bad 1970s tax-credit CanCon picture.</Review>
            <Review>Rural retreat provides scenic backdrop for a delightful, if bittersweet, blended family dramedy!</Review>
            <Review>No, it isn't a 12-step-recovery drama, but viewers may feel mildly hungover after an evening with this TV-level comedy of family dysfunction.</Review>
            <Review>Safe, innocuous and predictable.</Review>
            <Review>The Steps has one great line and one great performance, and it's remarkable that those two things are even detectable in this awful, awful comedy.</Review>

            <Review>"Francofonia" is terribly over-directed and seems strange just for the sake of being strange.</Review>
            <Review>This is disjointed and dreary, its power diluted by Sokurov's constant, self-important narration.</Review>
            <Review>Francofonia is a brilliant meditation on art, on war - and what happens to art when nations go to war.</Review>
            <Review>As Sokurov examines a pivotal point in the Louvre's history and gives us a virtual tour of the magnificent museum, he makes larger points about the vital importance of art throughout human history. This is one of the most beautiful films of the year.</Review>
            <Review>Near the one-hour mark, the filmmaker asks, "You aren't tired of listening to me yet?" If you aren't, you will be soon.</Review>
            <Review>"Francofonia," a powerful cinematic essay on how art and war are irrevocably intertwined, has an ideal canvas and time peg for its philosophical musings: the Louvre Museum during the Nazi occupation of France.</Review>
            <Review>Sokurov has great ability to get us interested in what's happening in spite of his unconventional narrative. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>With brutal and sometimes thrilling irony, Aleksandr Sokurov delivers a documentary that's equal parts sensible and effective. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>

            <Review>An unusual work that mixes genres to at times awkward but always powerful effect.</Review>
            <Review>With material this powerful, we shouldn't have to continually be puzzling out what's real and what's staged.</Review>
            <Review>As close as my political beliefs may be to Gitai's and as sympathetic as I am to his analysis, I can't help but mistrust his filmmaking.</Review>
            <Review>Frequently horrifying and never less than absorbing, "Rabin, the Last Day" is a meticulously observant portrait of a broken society.</Review>
            <Review>It's a profoundly frustrating movie, which is to say that it's an authentic expression of profound frustration.</Review>
            <Review>At times overemphatic (no one will ever accuse Gitai of holding too much back), this docu-thriller is also agonizingly suspenseful, despite the foreordained conclusion.</Review>
            <Review>An admirable elegy for the lost opportunity to achieve peace between Israel and Palestine. [Full Review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>There is a gaping hole at the heart of this movie where Rabin should be. His death, rather than his life, is the star of this film.</Review>
            <Review>It isn't quite an Israeli version of JFK, but Rabin, the Last Day rivals Oliver Stone's film in seeking to pose questions that official studies have refused to explore.</Review>
            <Review>I think Gitai is admirable for following its tradition of critical, investigative moviemaking in his own rough-and-ready style.</Review>
            <Review>Politics aside, what's patently fascinating about Gitai's films is how his architectural background is reflected in how he structures his work.</Review>

        <Duration>109</Duration>
        <StoryLine>In the fall of 2005, 19-year-old Ryan Ferguson was convicted of murder and sentenced to 40-years in prison based on someone else's dream. Over the next ten years while Ryan languished in prison, his father Bill engaged in a tireless crusade to find justice. dream/killer tells the story of this extraordinary father's journey to free his son. When Columbia Daily Tribune sports editor Kent Heitholt was brutally murdered in the newspaper's parking lot, the crime went unsolved for two years, leaving the affluent college town desperate to bring home justice. At the time, it was the only unsolved murder in the city. A break in the case lead police to Chuck Erickson, who confessed to the crime, implicated Ferguson as an accomplice and left America with one of the country's most outrageous miscarriages of justice. The documentary uses archival footage from when Ryan was first arrested, interviews with him in prison, and court hearings that reveal the strengths and the flaws of the American judicial system. The arguments of the ruthless prosecutor and Ryan's brilliant defense attorney are also depicted to show how easily the system is influenced. Interspersed with footage from the Ferguson family archive, dream/killer looks at the personal consequences of a wrongful conviction.</StoryLine>

            <Review>The stupid plot, dismal dialogue, moral turpitude and dispiriting torpor of this movie makes watching it utterly pointless.</Review>

            <Review>What persuaded Bruce Willis to accept a role in this cheap-looking, poorly scripted, irredeemably derivative crime thriller is a question only he, and his agent, can answer.</Review>
            <Review>Adams stages the opening speedboat chase with aplomb, but the shootouts are much more formulaic and rely heavily on the laughable inaccuracy of the gang's adversaries and sassy sharpshooter Jenna Kelly's penchant for skimpy outfits.</Review>
            <Review>Dire stuff with a mean-spirited, ugly script.</Review>
            <Review>This production clearly ploughed all its budget into a few slick action sequences and the cameo from Willis. It's a pity the film-makers didn't invest in the screenplay.</Review>

        <Duration>121</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Set in both the late 80's and current day, "Back in the Day" is a gritty tale about Anthony Rodriguez, a half-Italian, half-Puerto Rican young teenager growing up on the streets of Bensonhurst, Brooklyn; a then very dangerous and racist neighborhood filled with bullies, big shots and social clubs where all of the neighborhood shots were called. Anthony had to endure an abusive, unemployed, alcoholic father but was blessed with a nurturing, hard-working mother. In spite of his bitterness, he struggles to uphold the morals his Mother taught him to retain his dignity in spite of being up against all odds. He is taken under the wing of a local mob boss, Enzo Agostino, who supports Anthony's wishes to escape his demons through the sport of boxing. Enzo connects Anthony with a trainer who means business and turns Anthony into a contender although his troubled life and loyalty to his friends, who seem to always get him into trouble, hinder his career. As he journeys into adulthood with the nearly impossible goal of achieving a successful professional boxing career, Anthony manages to not only go pro, but literally fight his way to the top and become a world champion middleweight boxer. But not without love, loss of love, humiliation, retaliation and revenge playing roles in his journey. But when he finally does make it, who will be left of the people Anthony has ever cared about, to share it with?</StoryLine>

            <Review>It's a morally messy premise. Afghanistan is not Colin Firth. War is not Love Actually. And that is the problem with Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, which is overall a charming comedy about a terrible war.</Review>
            <Review>The film offers a fresh look at the adrenaline-laced lifestyle of war correspondents and a timely criticism of TV news. And it delivers some laughs, too.</Review>
            <Review>Writer and actress tilt between insecurity and bravado, employing dry, observational humour tinged with occasional sentimental flashes only outwardly out of character.</Review>
            <Review>Tina Fey is the biggest asset but even she's not sufficient to make it worth more than a marginal recommendation and a suggestion to wait until it shows up on home video.</Review>
            <Review>Tina Fey grounds the movie in something real, something urgent and human, and she nearly single-handedly saves the movie from itself. The movie itself isn't particularly serious, but she sure as hell is.</Review>
            <Review>Directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa move things along fast enough to keep [the problem aspects] from sinking in too deeply, and star Tina Fey holds the spotlight with aplomb.</Review>
            <Review>Where the movie around her suffers, Fey is terrific, stretching farther than she ever has -- and she will admit she hasn't tried -- and making the whole enterprise worth watching.</Review>
            <Review>Well-made and much more serious than it's being marketed, "Whiskey Tango Foxtrot" gives Tina Fey the chance to flex some acting chops you may not know she possessed</Review>
            <Review>Whiskey Tango Foxtrot never seems to be setting its sights any higher than a story of one woman's self-discovery. It had the perfect chance to give us something fresh and new, but instead sheepishly recoils just short of the finish line.</Review>
            <Review>Chances are you'll still respond to the dark wit, but you probably won't be, ahem, Lima Yankee Foxtrot Alpha Oscar.</Review>
            <Review>Fey turns in a commendable display to more than prove her worth as a dramatic actress, while she is fortunate enough to be surrounded by accomplished performers making up the supporting roles.</Review>
            <Review>...enjoyable but slightly underwhelming...</Review>

            <Review>A welcome surprise for sports cinema, "The Phenom" handles itself like Robert Redford's "Ordinary People" when exploring the psychology of a Lebron James or Johnny Manziel-like sports sensation.</Review>

            <Review>It's not necessary, of course, for "The Phenom" to be an all-out sports drama, but writer-director Noah Buschel sets up the rare opportunity to explore what makes a jock tick, then doesn't follow through.</Review>

        <Title>Seattle Road</Title>
        <ReleaseDate/>
        <Duration>83</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Seattle Road explores the paradox of a couple's love and the resentment that forms between two ambitious people. Eve is a beautiful but wounded woman, the product of an affluent and sophisticated background. Adam a sheltered, vulnerable man raised in a cult-like commune with his mother and younger brother who only recently escaped his confining background. Early in their relationship, Eve suffers from the loss of her estranged father and convinces Adam to move into her father's abandoned country home. She hides the fact that the property is actually not left to her in the will, and that they will basically be squatting at the home. Together they unknowingly embark on a journey that will be tumultuous to their relationship, leading to a great sense of impending doom. Exploring the ideas of serendipity and predestination, Adam and Eve are on a romantic collision course that's part of a larger design - that they're fated to be partners and to go through stages in their relationship that mirror their archetypal story from Genesis. Relying on the use of imperfect fragments of memory, this film deconstructs a relationship in a painful, realistic and ultimately hopeful journey.</StoryLine>

            <Review>More of the same from Malick, but as thin as it is, this is a trick that still hasn't run its course.</Review>
            <Review>There's nothing quite like a Malick movie. But once viewers have contemplated the mysteries of the universe itself, perhaps anything else will feel like a step down.</Review>
            <Review>This is all simply Malick being Malick - you're either on his wavelength or you're not.</Review>
            <Review>Virtually every scene is delivered through a gauzy cinematic curtain that obscures rather than elucidates, and we never come close to penetrating the angst-filled veneer of the protagonist.</Review>
            <Review>Malick has moved from self-discovery to self-affirmation; he knows exactly what he's looking for, and Knight of Cups, for all its splendor, made me wish that he could take a swig and forget.</Review>
            <Review>Taken as a straightforward movie, "Knight of Cups" is an indecipherable mess. Taken as a piece of nonlinear visual poetry, "Knight of Cups" is still an indecipherable mess.</Review>
            <Review>A new direction is needed or Malick's aura will surely evaporate.</Review>
            <Review>Both an accomplishment in introspective, transcendent filmmaking, and a puzzle as imbalanced as the knight at its center.</Review>
            <Review>As Rick muses mournfully to himself, "Where did I go wrong?" it's hard for the viewer not to ask the same question of Malick.</Review>
            <Review>Simply put: It's the most Malicky of Malick's recent films, relying on all his tricks and his tradecraft to convey a feeling rather than a story.</Review>
            <Review>Malick has a history of confounding moviegoers. But his latest piece of foggy strangeness plays like a two-hour trailer for a more linear 100-hour movie.</Review>
            <Review>For some, this impressionistic drama about a philandering Hollywood screenwriter looking for love and searching for a sense of self amid the fleshpots of Los Angeles and Las Vegas is a masterpiece. For others, it's simply self-indulgent twaddle.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 1975</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>88</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Though set in Key West, Florida, a goodly portion of 92 in the Shade was filmed in England. Peter Fonda plays Tom Skelton, a bum who gets a job as a fishing guide in his old home town. Nobody wants to have anything to do with Skelton, least of all rival guides Nichol Dance and Carter (Warren Oates and Harry Dean Stanton). Faced with financial disaster and widespread hostility, he turns to his wealthy grandfather Goldsboro (Burgess Meredith) for help. Taking time off from his lovemaking sessions with sexy secretary Bella (Sylvia Miles), his grandfather pumps some money into Tom's operation, and our hero makes his peace with Carter. A climactic fight with Nichol puts an end to that problem, while Tom's romantic relationship with Miranda (Margot Kidder) helps him sort out his priorities. Director/writer Thomas McGuane adapted the script from his own novel.</StoryLine>

            <Review>More than anything, The Wave's ability to sustain tension out of its tired scenario makes it even more impressive than its Me Decade ancestors.</Review>
            <Review>The whole thing is pure formula. But The Wave, which was Norway's official entry for the Academy Awards, makes it work anyway.</Review>
            <Review>The movie works; the setting feels grandly unfamiliar, and the aftermath of the wave, with its elemental mix of water and fire, seems like a plausible vision of Hell.</Review>
            <Review>Something like The Wave is indeed a rarity - without skimping on the spectacle that glues eyeballs to the screen, it takes the time to develop its characters.</Review>
            <Review>Having laid out my qualms in advance, I am happy to report that The Wave... is pretty good. It's also pretty strange.</Review>
            <Review>The wave itself is a masterfully believable bit of cinematic destruction in which everyone tries to rush for higher ground on narrow roads not meant to handle a rapid evacuation.</Review>
            <Review>Uthaug has ably demonstrated that one doesn't need a blockbuster budget to make a world class action film, and that the potential of the new Scandinavian cinema extends far beyond noir.</Review>
            <Review>Throws up Poseidon Adventure-like life-or-death situations that will leave you gasping for air as much as the imperilled survivors.</Review>
            <Review>The intimate focus, juxtaposed with the unsettling beauty of the backdrop and the eerie stillness of the aftermath, brings a novel twist to the well-worn disaster movie format.</Review>
            <Review>The Wave is a small-town Norwegian disaster movie writ satisfyingly large.</Review>
            <Review>You don't get the sort of outlandish motley crew of, say, a Roland Emmerich film. To be honest, that force of personality is sorely missed.</Review>
            <Review>Such apocalyptic events are nothing new on-screen, but Norwegian director Roar Uthaug imbues his film with rather more grit and texture than formulaic Hollywood efforts like 2012 and San Andreas.</Review>

            <Review>A couple of funny scenes, but it's amazing how quickly Sasha Baron Cohen's comedy has grown safe and stale.</Review>
            <Review>Cohen, brilliant in his craftier and more avant-garde shock-humor roles, is too irritating to make this character likable, much less lovable as the story demands.</Review>
            <Review>The joke at the heart of Sacha Baron Cohen's new comedy The Brothers Grimsby [is] an enjoyable one, even when the film as a whole weaves between being just hilariously foul and incoherently sloppy.</Review>
            <Review>Mostly, The Brothers Grimsby simply wants to make you laugh. And it will.</Review>
            <Review>A production that fails in every way at every turn.</Review>
            <Review>His obsession with anal cavities and what goes in and comes out of them suggest Cohen is auditioning to be the after-dinner amusement at a proctologists' convention.</Review>
            <Review>The attempts at satire fall flat despite some broad targets, and the result produces more groans than laughs.</Review>
            <Review>Even at less than 80 minutes sans end credits, "The Brothers Grimsby" is about as pleasant as elephant semen to the face.</Review>
            <Review>It brings to mind such one-star atrocities as The Love Guru, Freddy Got Fingered, and Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie -- comparisons that make this new picture a Chernobyl of comedy.</Review>
            <Review>It's taboo, it's politically incorrect, it's disrespectful and all with a love for the buttons it's pushing. They had me at the Daniel Radcliffe joke.</Review>
            <Review>Some of this is funny. A fair amount of it -- including the toilet joke -- isn't.</Review>
            <Review>It's extreme for its own sake, and too rarely for the satirical purposes of Baron Cohen's better vehicles, "Borat" and "Bruno."</Review>

            <Review>Riffing on John Carpenter's Starman, writer-director Jeff Nichols has crafted a sci-fi chase film whose gravely naturalistic style adds to its sense of portent.</Review>
            <Review>Nichols has earned the right to take big leaps. Even if he doesn't stick the landing, it's a thrill watching him try. He, too, is something special.</Review>
            <Review>You watch helplessly as the movie goes off the rails, the suspense and excitement leaking out of the enormous tension the early scenes had generated.</Review>
            <Review>It all sounds terribly murky, but few filmmakers are as gifted at making you want to peer through the murk.</Review>
            <Review>What started with a gripping premise slackens and goes limp.</Review>
            <Review>The movie has its flaws, but it is nonetheless an intriguing sci-fi entry and an engaging story about family.</Review>
            <Review>Midnight Special is a film about fatherhood and faith, with sci-fi elements that are engrossing, mysterious, and will linger with viewers for a long time.</Review>
            <Review>The first hour is compelling and had the second half lived up to it, sci-fi fans would feel as though they had struck gold.</Review>
            <Review>Midnight Special works nicely, coming across as a lower-budgeted Close Encounters of the Third Kind or a smarter, more human (and humane) version of Tomorrowland.</Review>

            <Review>It manages to rehash the original, almost entirely, while lacking nearly all the things that made the first film, despite its flaws, compelling.</Review>
            <Review>What we're left with is something that recalls Crocodile Dundee in L.A. - the misbegotten notion that bringing back characters long past their sell-by date is a good idea.</Review>
            <Review>Feels about as fresh as two-day old spanakopita.</Review>
            <Review>What once bubbled up from a sincere love of Greek family has now congealed into the all-too-familiar Hollywood tale of milking a cash cow until it cries for mercy.</Review>
            <Review>Pass the baklava.</Review>
            <Review>It's a big fat Greek dud.</Review>
            <Review>14 years after the insanely inescapable success of My Big Fat Greek Wedding comes its sequel ... This time around, the charm is gone.</Review>
            <Review>Vardalos rehashes the same script from fourteen years ago with most of the action revolving around faded relationships and culture clashes.</Review>
            <Review>Vardalos, who once again wrote the screenplay and also stars, has built this sequel on the premise that everything that happened in the previous film should be recreated in the second, but in a way that feels even less organic.</Review>
            <Review>As a big fan of both Lainie Kazan and Michael Constantine, I enjoyed most of the film.</Review>
            <Review>Flames out with moments cheesier than saganaki and more honeyed than the sickly sweetest baklava. The empty-nest nonsense is cringingly overwrought, with moments to curdle your blood into month-old tzatziki.</Review>
            <Review>Some of the callbacks to the first movie will probably charm the die-hards, but I'm guessing the most satisfying moment for most people will be when My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 finally ends.</Review>

        <StoryLine>In 1931, Harold Lasseter's body was found in the Central Australian desert. His diary revealed he'd discovered gold -- worth billions of dollars today -- but he'd give it all away for a loaf of bread and a chance at survival. The gold has never been found. Filmmaker Luke Walker finds Lasseter's 85 year-old son, still wandering the desert trying to find the gold that killed his father. Is it still possible to piece together the fragments of history Lasseter left behind? Armed with a camera, Walker chases his footsteps in hopes to unravel the tangle of myths, lies and legend that remain buried with Lasseter's bones. But as he follows his last few steps he finds himself closer to the gold than anyone has been for 80 years. Do you dare join the adventure and take part in the quest for Australia's Lost Gold?</StoryLine>

            <Review>At its most absorbing, Lasseter's story plays like an Aussie Treasure of the Sierra Madre, in which the main subject is a bit of a cypher whose true nature proves to be as difficult to pinpoint as that elusive gold.</Review>
            <Review>A muddled, boring film that circles back around on itself so many times that the effect is a bit like Groundhog Day.</Review>
            <Review>While you could argue that the film is slightly too long, and that Walker reads too much into things that feel inconsequential, it remains a fascinating look into an unrecognised slice of Australian history.</Review>
            <Review>[Walker's] enthusiasm is infectious, and in a way it's an asset that, unlike the majority of local documentary makers, he has no social or political axe to grind.</Review>
            <Review>Lassester's Bones is as much about the illumination of the myth surrounding the man as it is about man's desire to complete the incomplete and fulfil the unfulfilled. It's poetic, personal filmmaking.</Review>
            <Review>A splendid example of the sort of subjective documentary film-making championed by Werner Herzog...director Luke Walker throws himself into the legend of Harold Lasseter, the explorer who claimed to have stumbled across a mother lode of gold.</Review>
            <Review>It's a mythical story because of its scale and because of its mysteries, which Luke's intrepid journey seems to have enlarged.</Review>

            <Review>"The Young Messiah" performs no miracles.</Review>
            <Review>We know how the story ends, so there's little in the way of tension.</Review>
            <Review>This uninspiring, borderline inept spiritual drama about the Son of God's formative years preaches to the choir.</Review>
            <Review>This pious drama is a work of minimal imagination and even less subtlety.</Review>
            <Review>Perhaps realizing that enticing nonbelievers into another movie about the life of Christ may necessitate the wild-style of a director like Darren Aronofsky, the filmmakers decided to play it safe rather than risk conservative Evangelical rejection.</Review>
            <Review>The Young Messiah takes a different approach by focusing on a specific point in Jesus's childhood. But the faith-based film drags, and is mostly unremarkable.</Review>
            <Review>'The Young Messiah' helps fill in the blanks.</Review>
            <Review>The problem here is not its one- sidedness, but its one-dimensionality.</Review>
            <Review>Mostly the movie is simply dull, emotionally flat and so solemnly reverent that it's dramatically inert.</Review>
            <Review>It's only suspenseful if you aren't familiar with the story of Christ -- but if you aren't, there's no reason you'd be watching this.</Review>
            <Review>It's target audience will be happy, but it really doesn't add anything to the genre. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>

            <Review>A fascinating new film... about the wonderful life and premature death three years ago of one of sport's most charismatic artists.</Review>
            <Review>Seve's own interviews give more insight into what made the genius tick, and the footage towards the end is hugely moving, but this is still a sadly missed opportunity.</Review>
            <Review>However under par it gets, it's impossible not to shed a tear as the final chapter in Ballesteros' oft-magical life unfolds.</Review>
            <Review>Seve is for dedicated golf fans only, but there is some charm to this drama-documentary on the rise of Severiano Ballesteros from Spanish farmer's boy to world-class golfer.</Review>
            <Review>Gripping sports reportage with chocolate-box dramatisations of his childhood years, making this very much a game of two halves.</Review>
            <Review>An uneasy rose-tinted blending of striking documentary footage and plodding soap-opera style re-enactment ...</Review>
            <Review>Seve is moving in a way that sports movies rarely are -- and there is also some humour along the way.</Review>
            <Review>Seve offers fascinating insights not just into the life of legendary golfer Seve Ballesteros but into what it takes to succeed at the highest level: principally extraordinary dedication and an almost divine sense of mission.</Review>
            <Review>This is primarily for fans, but it's engaging enough.</Review>
            <Review>A fitting tribute to a bona fide sporting icon.</Review>
            <Review>Severiano Ballesteros was one of the least boring golfers in the history of his sport, but you wouldn't necessarily know it from watching Seve ...</Review>

            <Review>Eddie the Eagle tries to have it both ways with its main subject, simultaneously ridiculing and ennobling him. And, amazingly, it mostly works.</Review>
            <Review>Taron Egerton reproduces Eddie's offbeat charm, turning him into an Asperger's afflicted champion of the undertrodden.</Review>
            <Review>For every easy, eye-rolling bit, there's a moment of genuine emotion; the champion jumper's pre-climax speech on what matters in sport is downright joyful.</Review>
            <Review>While it's often cookie-cutter sports movie conventional, you'd have to be stone-hearted to remain un-charmed.</Review>
            <Review>It is a rare biopic of any kind, let alone a sports bio, that merely celebrates participation. It's that novelty that makes this simple comedy shine.</Review>
            <Review>Though it aims for heroism, Edwards' story doesn't have a dramatic enough arc to be truly inspirational. It's not about winning, it's an ode to participation, which isn't enough for it to get off the ground.</Review>
            <Review>A rousing underdog film about an Olympic ski-jumper that will send you home with hope in your heart.</Review>
            <Review>With his milk-bottle glasses, jutting chin and fuzzy moustache, plucky British ski jumper Eddie 'The Eagle' Edwards... remains an endearing figure of fun in this feel-good sporting romp.</Review>
            <Review>Eddie the Eagle is one of those underdog sports stories we all love so much, with an excellent performance from the likeable, empathetic Hugh Jackman.</Review>
            <Review>It gives a newfound appreciation of what [Edwards] achieved and turns his struggles into an amiable and enjoyable adventure.</Review>
            <Review>"Eddie the Eagle" doesn't soar as high as it could have, but at least it doesn't crash.</Review>
            <Review>Watching this eagle take to the sky still manages to be a cheery delight.</Review>

            <Review>A sharp dramedy focusing on the romantic stirrings of a lonely office worker, played with considerable wit and verve by the 69-year-old Sally Field.</Review>
            <Review>The best thing about Hello, My Name Is Doris is that nothing gets resolved in the expected movie fashion. The story will make you laugh, no question, but it will also make you deeply uncomfortable, and we mean that in the best way.</Review>
            <Review>Field and director Michael Showalter (who also co-writes, with Laura Terruso) find humanity within the humour.</Review>
            <Review>A winning comedy-drama built around one of cinema's most endearing leading ladies.</Review>
            <Review>Showalter, whose 2005 romantic comedy "The Baxter" was similarly kindhearted, handles the material with tenderness and care, and never lets it devolve into meanness the way it might in the hands of another director.</Review>
            <Review>A running joke about hipster clich√©s is tiresome, and the movie's plot threads are uneven. But watching Field work her magic is so delightful.</Review>
            <Review>An puzzling tragic comedy. Sometimes it can be really humane and sometimes it's just irritating. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>A fun movie about loneliness, wasted time, holding onto things and the differences between generations. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>A warm, heart-tugging drama laced with amusing situations that Sally Field and Max Greenfield play to the hilt.</Review>
            <Review>This role is so perfect for Field -- she's famous for her ability to personify earnest gawkiness.</Review>
            <Review>Not into complying with whatever stereotypical scraps are allotted to older actresses in movies, Field embraces her character with geriatric gusto. Displaying elder empowerment with eccentric charm and bold sexual desire - however freaky or fantastical.</Review>
            <Review>Cannily written and directed by Michael Showalter (Wet Hot American Summer), so that an air of whimsical hope and discovery never quite comes unstuck at the hands of embarrassment and recrimination.</Review>

            <Review>Crass and painfully unfunny satirical comedy shot four years ago. It's finally receiving a token theatrical release concurrent with being dumped into the video-on-demand sludge pile.</Review>
            <Review>This long-shelved comedy proves a disappointing mix of onscreen talent, uneven social satire and juvenile humor.</Review>
            <Review>Not only is this a movie without any guts, it doesn't have much of a brain either.</Review>
            <Review>"Get a Job" is nothing special.</Review>
            <Review>The imperfect work mired in storage all this time gets a well-deserved spin.</Review>
            <Review>Clearly, the economy has given Get a Job a reason to be sour. But there's no excuse for being so sexist.</Review>
            <Review>A weak and wobbly comedy about the difficulties of millennials in the wonderful world of work.</Review>
            <Review>Neither a contemporary workplace satire nor an insightful lampoon of the laziness of overprivileged millennials ...</Review>
            <Review>A brutally cynical, largely unfunny film fueled by muddled social commentary.</Review>
            <Review>What makes Get A Job so infuriatingly bad, rather than the kind of film you hate and then completely forget about, is the all-star cast that it has at its disposal and disgracefully wastes.</Review>
            <Review>Get A Job's primary problem is that it doesn't know if it wants to be a realistic look at millennials and the current economy, or go for the cheap gag about the jive-talking pimp renting out a sleazy motel.</Review>

            <Review>In the beautifully acted drama"45 Years," a marriage lives and dies; we watch its agonized struggle, like a butterfly impaled on a pin.</Review>
            <Review>What's the big deal? How does an entire film come of this? There are satisfying answers to these questions, but to state them would be to ruin a perfectly good movie.</Review>
            <Review>Daringly unsentimental, "45 Years" makes a persuasive case that marriage demands not only patience, but guts.</Review>
            <Review>45 Years exposes the paradoxical balance of the successful marriage, one that requires a sentimental suspension of disbelief on the one hand and a hard-headed ability to deal with the everyday on the other.</Review>
            <Review>It's a slow-burning build to the astonishing final scene.</Review>
            <Review>A fine alternative if you're tired of bears, both grizzlies and pandas.</Review>
            <Review>Soul-stirring and acute in its diagnosis of how a well-established couple negotiates its own continued survival.</Review>
            <Review>A safe bet, a good movie about deep themes. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Shocking news make a 45 year old marriage tumble in this drama where Charlotte Rampling is fierce and cold at the same time while delivering a touching performance. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Haigh consecrates itself (eluding greater risks) with an elegant and delicate film. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>

            <Review>Racist, stupid and boasting cheesy effects that wouldn't pass muster on basic cable.</Review>

        <Duration>100</Duration>
        <StoryLine>"Puerto Ricans In Paris" is a story of friendship, loyalty and a life-changing trip to Paris. Detectives Luis Lopez and Eddie Garcia are childhood best friends, brother-in-laws, and partners in the New York Police Department Luxury Goods Recovery Unit tasked with hunting down Canal Street's infamous bootleggers. With Luis as the slick, self-styled "brains" of the operation and Eddie as the shy, quiet "muscle," they've been running through the streets of the Lower East side in search of fake Louis Vuitton for 20 years - long enough for them to be the best in the business. While their work mostly keeps them below 14th Street, a random visit from a celebrated French designer and her business partner set in motion a sequence of events that take them on a wild goose chase through the streets of Paris - from fashion parties to hipster nightclubs - in search of a stolen handbag (and delicious French macarons). As the investigation deepens with no sign of the bag, our two best friends start to grow suspicious of everyone around them - including each other. "Puerto Ricans in Paris" is a fashion whodunnit with laughs, drop-crotch pants, and a lot of heart.</StoryLine>

            <Review>It's charming. It's funny.</Review>
            <Review>Luis Guzman is an instantly recognizable character actor who deserves his shot at being the face of a film. It's just unfortunate that the film turns out to be the lethargic and rarely funny fish-out-of-American-water comedy Puerto Ricans in Paris.</Review>
            <Review>It's difficult to see how the film itself could be any less substantial without evaporating on screen.</Review>
            <Review>A formulaic fish-out-of-water buddy caper given an amusing boost with a casual scrunch of Guzm√°n's pug-nosed mug.</Review>
            <Review>Guzman and Garcia (reunited from HBO's "How to Make It in America") are a joy to watch, and deliver their lines with just enough nuance to make them truly endearing; sometimes it works, others not so much.</Review>
            <Review>Culture-clash buddy comedy has some crude humor, gun use.</Review>
            <Review>There are no laughs, the plot is a bore, and visiting Paris is just an excuse to wheel out postcard backdrops and attractive women. And yet Guzm√°n and Garcia are good together.</Review>
            <Review>At least the title accurately describes the culture-clash shenanigans in this lackluster low-budget comedy.</Review>
            <Review>The grand takeaway from Puerto Ricans in Paris, which delivers what you'd expect and not much else, is that someone ought to finally give Luis Guzm√°n the leading role of a lifetime.</Review>
            <Review>Why in the world do the filmmakers go to the trouble of casting Rosario Dawson and Rosie Perez as the detectives' significant others and then leave them in the States away from all the hijinks?</Review>
            <Review>The entire film feels like it could have been made for TV back in the '80s.</Review>

            <Review>First-time writer-director Felix Thompson demonstrates good instincts for two of King Jack's standard three acts.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director Felix Thompson's first film is a sensitive and self-possessed debut that clocks in at 76 minutes and doesn't waste a single one of them.</Review>
            <Review>It's a tribute to Thompson's humane sensitivity to character detail that its concluding jolt of affirmation feels fully, inspirationally earned.</Review>
            <Review>Dark coming-of-age movie has intense, sadistic bullying.</Review>
            <Review>Though Thompson clearly has a facility with young actors, as nearly every performance in the film is very good, it's not enough to save the film from mediocre clich√©s and poor dialogue baked into the script.</Review>
            <Review>Might not have the freshest ingredients in the indie kitchen, but it still knows how to stir up something with a kick.</Review>
            <Review>... steers away from clich√©s and cheap sympathy, and instead resonates with raw authenticity.</Review>
            <Review>The debut feature of Felix Thompson is an assured coming-of-age drama.</Review>

            <Review>It's a well-photographed story with an intriguing setup, but soon we're mired in a meandering, stilted story with forced dialogue and some surprisingly subpar performances from the talented cast.</Review>
            <Review>Wenders has a history of employing exceptional cinematographers (such as Robby M√ºller), and here gets fine work from Benoit Debie, whose glowing landscapes and interiors contribute at least as much as the script.</Review>
            <Review>A small but taut drama in which the beautiful physical details jumping off the screen only serve to emphasize an ill-defined setting and major insufficiencies in the script and performances.</Review>
            <Review>With backing from producers in no less than five countries and director of the gravitas of Wim Wenders - not to mention a solid cast - you'd think Every Thing Will Be Fine would be more impressive than it turns out to be.</Review>
            <Review>Wenders is trying to do new things within the confines of a pretty standard European art-film scenario, and the viewer can see he's not approaching the material as though it's rote ...</Review>
            <Review>Even for a movie about a writer detached from his emotions, it's ponderous, like a lucid dream gone bad.</Review>
            <Review>Even those moments that raise the eyebrows sky-high still have a weird integrity and determination skating under the surface.</Review>
            <Review>Angst-filled drama is surprisingly dull and uninteresting.</Review>
            <Review>Not even Wenders seems to understand what this film is trying to say about the human experience.</Review>
            <Review>Comparisons to Atom Egoyan's masterful puzzle The Sweet Hereafter would be unfair to this puzzling mass.</Review>
            <Review>Story-less tale of depression isn't helped by 3D cinematography</Review>
            <Review>There are some lovely compositions both indoors and outdoors (including a use of split-screen), but Every Thing Will Be Fine still lacks the poetry or even fundamental interest of the film of his it most closely resembles, Paris, Texas.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>The final word on this incident will require a more thoughtful filmmaker. But hopefully, that artist will possess at least half of Bay's punishing, peerless craft.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is imperfect and overlong but it's never boring. And, although aspects of its factual accuracy can be called into question, it does a decent job of chronicling what happened that night.</Review>
            <Review>Several critics have given 13 Hours a pass, citing Bay's skill at action engineering. It's his failure at everything else that makes this movie as hard to endure as it is impossible to believe. #helpme</Review>
            <Review>[Bay] does well here what he always does well: He keeps the action at full throttle. This is also what he does so annoyingly: He always keeps things at full throttle.</Review>
            <Review>[Bay] is hell on manly banter amid the explosions ("Just another Tuesday night in Benghazi"), and also moments carefully calculated to make you feel the horrors - and the heroics - of war. Emphasis on "calculated."</Review>
            <Review>Bay's action sequences are as riveting and technically beautiful as ever, but his reductive worldview is also on display. "13 Hours" doesn't just lionize its American soldiers, it oozes disdain for everyone else.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately, is the takeaway. 13 Hours is a good Michael Bay movie... but it's still a Michael Bay movie.</Review>
            <Review>The loss of life is movingly depicted but these largely unfeasible, weirdly unreal characters are much too cocky and swaggery, when not being disdainful and patronising towards the locals. So don't bother.</Review>
            <Review>A moving tale of heroism and sacrifice wrapped in an explosive package that will quicken your pulse.</Review>
            <Review>At best it's a passable blood-pressure-cranking thriller, like a foreign-set Homeland episode, but without the political soul-searching. At worst, it's like a live-action Team America, roaring to climax in a noisy blaze of stars and stripes.</Review>
            <Review>"13 Hours" ranks with "Platoon" as a true depiction of what war really is.</Review>
            <Review>Makes American Sniper look positively pacifist by comparison.</Review>

            <Review>Charlie Kaufman's animated feature is one of his best films yet, a haunting fable about the illusion of love.</Review>
            <Review>Kaufman's script stings with uncomfortable truths, but doesn't do much else. Kaufman's medium has changed but his message is still the same.</Review>
            <Review>What drives the film is a scowling suspicion that modern man is a mechanized being, created as if on an assembly line, and stripped bare of individuality-a product, like any other merchandise.</Review>
            <Review>A very fine portrait of the despair at the heart of a comfortable middle-aged white man in America circa right about now.</Review>
            <Review>Whether Michael Stone has really turned a corner in his life, or merely enjoyed a brief distraction from all that troubles him, is left unresolved at Anomalisa's conclusion, but this much is certain: The audience won't soon forget what it has experienced.</Review>
            <Review>Kaufman, the mind behind "Being John Malkovich" and "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," possesses an artistic sensibility unlike any other filmmaker working today. That sensibility informs every word and frame of "Anomalisa" ...</Review>
            <Review>Anomalisa is one of the most enrapturing daring and moving films you will see this year.</Review>
            <Review>That, perhaps, is the genius of Anomalisa: its ability to inspire pity for unpleasant puppets-and their puppeteers.</Review>
            <Review>More emotionally complex than many humans you'll see on screen in 2016, their grapples with loneliness will pull powerfully on your heartstrings, no puppet pun intended.</Review>
            <Review>It's kind of a suffocating view of humanity, and not one with terribly new insights into middle-aged male behavior , though it has an impressively creative way of re-packaging those insights.</Review>
            <Review>Kaufman's protagonist, as always, is a man trapped in a world where reality has shifted sideways, but which he has come to accept as normal.</Review>
            <Review>By the time Michael and Lisa are up in that hotel room, trying so heroically to say the right thing, the picture has transcended its gimmicks.</Review>

            <Review>Rockwell and Kendrick are great together, but the movie never quite marries the cute romance and the bloody killings. Most of the time the two leads appear to be on their own in a completely separate movie.</Review>
            <Review>Mr. Right isn't a bad movie as much as it is two-and-a-half, maybe three bad movies playing all at the same time.</Review>
            <Review>"Mr. Right" hires two charismatic lead actors, Anna Kendrick and Sam Rockwell, then expects them to carry a movie with almost no compelling reason to exist.</Review>
            <Review>Rockwell, who literally dances his way through battle scenes with guns and knives, hasn't had a role this satisfying in years.</Review>
            <Review>The ludicrous action-flick plot slows to a crawl whenever Kendrick and Rockwell aren't on screen (although RZA has a fun cameo as a kindhearted gunman), but the unlikely duo make this candy-colored carnival of blood and romance hard to resist.</Review>
            <Review>Kendrick and Rockwell score every hit they can with screenwriter Max Landis's hit-or-miss chatter. Kendrick has always been funny, but has she ever been let loose like this?</Review>
            <Review>"I wanna do something terrible!" Kendrick announces early in the film, and she at least did that - she did 'Mr. Right.'</Review>
            <Review>Anna Kendrick continues to be eminently watchable in absolutely anything and everything.</Review>
            <Review>Very uneven but ultimately passable RomCom guns-and-guts mash-up.</Review>
            <Review>While it's supposed to add up to a witty marriage between romance and anarchy, it's so light on moral implications that it's just tacky.</Review>
            <Review>Teamed together on another project in the future, [Rockwell and Kendrick] could really be on to something.</Review>
            <Review>...a win-win charmer.</Review>

            <Review>Read the Wikipedia page. You'll learn more.</Review>
            <Review>Watson and Bruhl give it their best, and Nyqvist makes a powerful villain, but "Colonia" winds up being a movie that wants to get its way on too many levels, and winds up not satisfying on most of them.</Review>
            <Review>Watson, with her razor-sharp Hermione Granger conviction very much intact, gives us reason to care about her character's predicament even as the dramatics that put her there prove considerably less convincing.</Review>
            <Review>It somehow manages to feel more like a Hallmark Channel romance than like a serious film.</Review>
            <Review>The gears don't all churn at the same speed or with unison of purpose: Is it supposed to be a romance or a thriller?</Review>
            <Review>Although genuinely gripping - at times, uncomfortably so - the tale of Lena and Daniel's efforts to escape from Colonia and expose its abuses suffers from a heavy-handed telling.</Review>
            <Review>This is an involving, important depiction of a grim, underreported period in Chile's history.</Review>
            <Review>It's a glib trivialisation of one of the grimmer chapters of Chilean history.</Review>
            <Review>The Colony has decent enough production values but still feels silly and overwrought.</Review>

            <Review>Questions may linger about what's real and what's projected from Ren's turbulent feelings, but the film creates such vivid worlds on both sides of the alley, you'll root for their coexistence.</Review>
            <Review>What sets this film apart from its generic predecessors is writer/director Hosoda's knack for playful set pieces, and unsentimental love of surrogate familial communities.</Review>
            <Review>A brilliant, funny morality tale that examines the transformative effects of martial-arts training.</Review>
            <Review>The characterizations and conflicts here are strictly generic.</Review>

            <Review>Along with writing partner Ernest Riera, Roberts pilfers odds and ends of Hindu religious practices and folklore to construct a middling ghost story that traces a vaguely Gothic outline, only to follow a wearyingly derivative trajectory.</Review>

            <Review>Written, directed, edited, scored, and partially lived by bipolar filmmaker Paul Dalio, this intense romantic drama solely exists to prove that his so-called "disorder" isn't a dehumanizing defect.</Review>
            <Review>Dalio's script doesn't always flow as smoothly as the camera work, but an air of calm authenticity should leave audiences touched, in a good way.</Review>
            <Review>"Touched With Fire" is effective in showing the intensity of a new relationship and the barriers people build up around themselves when they take on an us-against-the-world mentality.</Review>
            <Review>"Touched With Fire" raises multiple topics of discussion, then avoids eye contact when it's time for the actual conversation.</Review>
            <Review>Dalio, who based the film (his directing debut) on his own struggles with bipolar disorder, establishes a gentle, honest tone that never wavers - and demonstrates a knack for vivid imagery that makes him a filmmaker to watch.</Review>
            <Review>[An] earnest and beautiful but occasionally flawed drama.</Review>
            <Review>Writer/director Dalio is the real deal - he's got a great eye and ear, and a way with visceral moments of abstract sound and imagery that place the viewer in his characters' headspace.</Review>
            <Review>Episodic and empathetic, it explores sanity and creativity, culminating in a rolling scroll, naming many artists afflicted with bipolar disorder.</Review>
            <Review>This drama attempts to open an earnest discussion of bipolar disorder, and it can be informative, but its message is muddled and indecisive.</Review>
            <Review>The film was an exciting display of visual cues that reminds one of Life of Pi when digital filmmaking really took off.</Review>
            <Review>A mediocre but largely unpretentious drama, probably of interest only to those with personal experience with its themes.</Review>
            <Review>Whatever misgivings one might harbor about 'Touched With Fire,' the film...provides a thoughtful take on a provocative subject.</Review>

            <Review>Not the cleverest or most original horror comedy, Andy Palmer's indie feature is nonetheless above average within that subgenre, offering fast-paced fun for fans.</Review>
            <Review>The minimal story quickly devolves into one methodical murder after another - their effect blunted by the jokey tone.</Review>
            <Review>The problem is that "The Funhouse Massacre" isn't particularly funny or scary, and if there is supposed to be an element of satire about our contemporary inability to sort out what's real from what's not, well, that falls flat, too.</Review>
            <Review>Amateurish direction and generic characterization make a light premise - serial killers slaughter a rural carnival's haunted-house patrons while pretending to be carnies - feel like a slog.</Review>
            <Review>A grab bag of laughs, gore, and creeps, and it's definitely a horror comedy you should look in to come October.</Review>
            <Review>It deftly handles all the horror pic clich√©s and the performers are a trip to watch.</Review>
            <Review>Holds a low-budget charm, but there is a better film-one that's cleverer, creepier, and more imaginatively utilizes its setting-just out of reach.</Review>
            <Review>a bloody good time with plenty of gore and some authentic haunted house moments</Review>
            <Review>The Funhouse Massacre isn't the kind of unexpected eye-opener that keeps genre fans panning through the silt, but it has moments.</Review>
            <Review>The Funhouse Massacre is a charismatic sideshow from Hell that horror fans shouldn't miss. You'll laugh, you'll scream, and you'll have an absolute blast with each scare zone that this killer attraction has to offer.</Review>
            <Review>I enjoyed The Funhouse Massacre and would watch it again; it's a good addition to the Halloween-themed canon. The title says it all: fun and massacre.</Review>

            <Review>Despite its formulaic structure, The Abandoned has a lot going for it. It eschews cheap scares, bloodletting, and gore.</Review>
            <Review>The film is effective for long stretches, mainly due to Rockaway's superb use of his principal setting.</Review>
            <Review>Just when you think this IFC Midnight flick will slide into an effective genre track, it flies off the rails in spectacular fashion, getting more unbearable and ridiculous all the way up to its closing minutes.</Review>
            <Review>Eytan Rockaway's generic chiller clings so tightly to conventions that it fails to even moderately raise one's pulse.</Review>
            <Review>Two second-act revelations alter its tired dynamic for the better, but those changes are undone by cheap scares and a climactic revelation that's more ho-hum than horrifying.</Review>
            <Review>A visually and emotionally effective descent into darkness.</Review>
            <Review>The Abandoned is a steadfast and creepy haunted flick, until the final five minutes sink the entire production. It'll work for some, but sadly not for most.</Review>
            <Review>If you've ever wondered why studios treat this month like a celluloid landfill, The Abandoned presents a compelling case study on its own lack of merit.</Review>
            <Review>[A] polished but overly familiar psychological thriller.</Review>
            <Review>Jason Patric...Man, what happened?</Review>
            <Review>Rockaway has created a genuinely eerie and intimate ghost story with The Abandoned, rising above many of the usual supernatural tropes to create something powerfully unconventional.</Review>
            <Review>I was somewhat dissatisfied with the ending, but that sort of thing is subjective, and I encourage everyone to watch The Abandoned to judge for themselves.</Review>

            <Review>Ultimately, the whole thing feels like little more than an excuse to queue up the song, "In the End," which Carter and company croon over the closing credits. Frankly, it's a payoff that can't come soon enough.</Review>
            <Review>The amusement over the boy bands vs zombies concept wears off about 10 minutes after the hypercolorized, bargain-bin Sin City style character introductions. Once the team is settled in, the film takes on an earnest tone and forgets to be in on the joke.</Review>
            <Review>Dead 7 is another SyFy attempt at wacky genre fun that's completely mucked up by The Asylum's ham-fisted, grimy, low-cost approach to filmmaking.</Review>

            <Review>Their latest, Hail, Caesar!, is their giddiest comedy to date, but it's also hit-and-miss within itself.</Review>
            <Review>The Coen brothers' new comedy isn't quite an homage to 1950s Hollywood, but it's not a spoof of it either -- it strikes that tone of crisp drollness that's their specialty and that some people misread as aloofness or contempt. But it's not.</Review>
            <Review>This is fairly amusing if you can get past the Coens' erasure of the anticommunist witch hunts, which destroyed hundreds of lives.</Review>
            <Review>An unexpectedly sweet and utterly satisfying confection, a loving sendup of the Hollywood of yesteryear.</Review>
            <Review>Not one of the Coens' major works, but it's a very enjoyable lark, especially for fans of old Hollywood.</Review>
            <Review>The more 1950s movies a person has seen and the greater their love for Hollywood of 60+ years ago, the greater their appreciation will be of what Joel and Ethan have brought to the screen.</Review>
            <Review>I enjoyed their films. Particularly the early, good ones.</Review>
            <Review>A nice trip to the past thanks to the amazing performances, beautiful photography and light humor. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>

            <Review>In what could be the most Coen Brothers movie ever, the masters of bone dry irony and quirk line up an all-star cast to pay homage to an era of Hollywood when actors were indeed cattle and movies dripped with glamour and the promise of escape.</Review>

            <Review>Everyone is horrible all the time-so when they do horrible things to each other, the result is a chuckle rather than a vicious bite. The music business is cutthroat, we get it.</Review>
            <Review>"Kill Your Friends" goes to some ugly places, but it keeps a sturdy sense of rhythm.</Review>
            <Review>Watching "Kill Your Friends" unfold is not dissimilar to being at a party where someone's clever one-liner lulls you into a conversation that reveals a bitterly immature, dismissively one-note lout, after which you're trapped.</Review>
            <Review>Anchoring the pungent 1990s ambience is Mr. Hoult, easily oozing cool charisma.</Review>
            <Review>Though the script is full of arch, darkly funny observations, the movie gets stuck on the same clanging chord of all-hating cynicism.</Review>
            <Review>A more disagreeable collection of cynical, backstabbing, self-aggrandizing, shallow, vicious and vile specimens of humanity gathered together in a single motion picture would be difficult to conceive of.</Review>
            <Review>Hoult is a fine actor for sure but he's just too damn good-looking and smooth as the dark-hearted record company man. Hoult's craven A&amp;R man has the killer instinct but his insecurities never seem entirely convincing.</Review>
            <Review>Saturates itself in nihilistic excess while presenting an uncompromisingly grim portrait of the recording industry. What is has to say, however, eventually grows stale as its narrative repetitively hits the same beats again and again.</Review>
            <Review>As adapted by screenwriter John Niven from his own novel, Kill Your Friends has a decidedly been-there, killed-that feel to it.</Review>
            <Review>Nicholas Hoult shines in this blackest of black comedies.</Review>
            <Review>The cynical film might be more annoying than eyeopening but the soundtrack kicks, as it features groups like Blur, Oasis and Radiohead.</Review>
            <Review>Sometimes bad behavior can be entertaining, but in this cynical story of the music industry, it's simply depressing. There's no vicarious thrill, no exhilaration, only uninspired, unpunished meanness.</Review>

            <Review>If the resolution isn't quite as satisfying as either the buildup or the performances by the likes of Dexter's C.S. Lee, it's still a well-made thriller.</Review>
            <Review>It's all in the service of what turns out to be a find-what-the-filmmaker-has-hidden narrative riddle, a pretty well executed one when all is said and done, but a not terribly memorable one either.</Review>
            <Review>A good mystery and earnest performances keep the movie lively, though the confined location and limited plot ultimately make the end product feel paltry.</Review>
            <Review>While it sometimes comes off like a staged play, it's an impressive debut from a director in full control of the material.</Review>
            <Review>Altered Minds moves almost too slowly through a family's dynamics but culminates with a heart-wrenching punch in the gut.</Review>
            <Review>An intriguing concept isn't explored to its full potential in this low-key psychological thriller.</Review>
            <Review>While lacking a grippingly sharp edge -- it heads into strange and violent territory but is never overly comfortable there -- it is always intriguing and defiantly left-field.</Review>
            <Review>Dramatically, Altered Minds is as cold as the snowy outdoors with emotionally inaccessible characters difficult for us to empathize with, even Dad.</Review>

            <Review>For all its failings, for all its pretension, Mark Of The Witch is a damn sight bolder and more interesting than most of what's around these days, and for that reason it's well worth seeking out.</Review>
            <Review>You know those indie horror movies your indie-horror-hating friends make fun of? That's Mark Of The Witch.</Review>
            <Review>Alas, people will not stop talking, will not allow this to be a quasi-experimental work that gnaws like a worm into our sense of well-being by using imagery that is both confounding and limbic.</Review>
            <Review>Cinematographed within an inch of its life (and death), "Mark of the Witch" (aka "Another") would have worked beautifully as a silent picture.</Review>
            <Review>Part trippy riff on the cultish coven of Suspiria (1977), part modern retelling of Snow White, Another more than makes up for occasional shortcomings in its script with a disorienting barrage of lysergically edited, disjointedly beautiful imagery.</Review>
            <Review>While Another is rough around the edges it's an extremely stylish and bizarre entry in the demonic possession sub-genre of horror.</Review>

            <Review>The bottom line is that Burr Steers' adaptation is unlikely to please any audience regardless of what they're looking for.</Review>
            <Review>This is a perfect film for our mash-up/viral culture in which short, clever, easily digestible bits of entertainment are passed along giddily from friend to friend. But most shareable YouTube videos run a couple minutes. "Zombies" is much, much longer.</Review>
            <Review>An unexpected and off-kilter treat, thanks to a BBC-quality cast and (un)deadpan humor.</Review>
            <Review>Maybe someone else can crack the code to the ultimate Austen mash-up when the inevitable "Sense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters" adaption comes along.</Review>
            <Review>Both pride and prejudice still play their parts, but now in service to one tediously repeated joke: the sight of a gentleman or a lady, together or alone, playing cards or ballroom dancing, fatally swarmed by devouring zombies.</Review>
            <Review>The steampunk fashion by costume designer Julian Day -- all gothy greatcoats, bodices, lace-up boots and strappy leather holsters -- was about the only saving grace of two brainless hours.</Review>
            <Review>This adaptation of the spoof novel Pride and Prejudice and Zombies ditches some of the book's darker elements to make a streamlined female-empowerment story.</Review>
            <Review>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies may have seemed like an interesting idea on paper, but when trying to combine these two elements on film, it makes for a narratively-befuddled experience in which they only get in each other's way.</Review>
            <Review>Plucky and vulnerable in equal measure, [James] never forgets that this is just meant to be cheesy fun and clearly has a blast with her role.</Review>
            <Review>Not quite a debacle, not at all a success, it ends up a thoroughly inconsequential adaptation that's unlikely to shepherd a new wave of mash-ups to the big screen.</Review>
            <Review>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies laughs at action cinema as a genre that has always left women in a weaker standing. [Full Review in Spanish]</Review>

            <Review>If one is going to make special effects the focus of a movie, they need to be good special effects, and that's not the case here. Proyas' ideas are never fully translated from imagination to screen.</Review>
            <Review>Gods of Egypt gets lost in its own budget, constantly shooting to outdo its visual grandeur but forgetting to lend it any depth. But there's a mad ambition at work.</Review>
            <Review>It's tempting to dismiss Gods of Egypt as the most perfectly bad film I've ever seen. But that's not fair. It's perfectly itself - a bizarre, yet cohesive, construction.</Review>
            <Review>It's a mystery what happened to the movie's reported $140 million budget. The CGI effects vacillate in quality from ho-hum to horrendous.</Review>
            <Review>It's penned by the screenwriters behind the hopeless Dracula Untold and The Last Witch Hunter, who must be really good in pitch meetings because this is utter nonsense.</Review>
            <Review>ny picture featuring Geoffrey Rush channelling King Lear as the patriarch god Ra while flying about in a spaceship can't be all bad.</Review>

            <Review>Race is earnest and sincere but it lacks the complexity that made 42 (the story about African-American baseball superstar Jackie Robinson) cinematically compelling.</Review>
            <Review>Race is a classic underdog sports movie.</Review>
            <Review>Race attempts to tell two stories: about the life of Jesse Owens and the relationship between the US and Germany. Neither receives the attention it deserves.</Review>
            <Review>All in all a conventional movie that won't frighten the horses.</Review>
            <Review>This is a very powerful film with excellent performances by Stephan James and Jason Sudeikis. Director Stephen Hopkins maintains a good pace, despite having a lot of characters and a complicated story to deal with.</Review>

            <Review>There's a blue-chip cast running the gamut from A (Casey Affleck) to W (Kate Winslet) and terrific action sequences in Triple 9 - but in the end, this relentlessly nihilistic crime-caper thriller adds up to less than the sum of its impressive parts.</Review>
            <Review>The movie involves a pair of heists, a prisoner abroad, corrupt cops, mobsters, gangsters, and more, and the parts are considerably better than the messy, unfocused whole. But oh, the parts can be a pleasure.</Review>
            <Review>Hillcoat's approach is to craft a pulse-pounding experience that employs a mixture of conventional footage and hand-held work. There's an immediacy to the most gripping scenes.</Review>
            <Review>The uneven thing [here] is John Hillcoat's direction: a tense, sustained journey through an apartment while lined up behind a bulletproof shield alternating with indulgent zooms and cuts depicting local color.</Review>
            <Review>Hillcoat directs with a sense of immediacy and grimy realism, bringing the audience into the shootouts and bloodshed on the streets. Atlanta becomes another war zone for the men who have seen war, battling an enemy of a different race and culture.</Review>
            <Review>Though compelling in the acting and cinematography, Triple 9's plot is by the numbers and about nothing.</Review>
            <Review>Should've been better for a John Hillcoat movie. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>If you like your crime flicks grim and gritty you'll be able to fill your boots here.</Review>
            <Review>Triple 9 trips over its own lofty ambitions.</Review>
            <Review>The action set-pieces are well performed and director Hillcoat keeps the film moving from the first frame to the last.</Review>
            <Review>It is a tense, amped-up, hyperviolent caper whose cops and robbers are not always easy to distinguish</Review>

        <StoryLine>In 1983, 13-year-old Oliver Nicholas is well-poised to enter the precocious teenage world of first-time sex, alcohol and love in New York City when Aida, the family housekeeper and his only true motherly figure, has a traumatizing stroke. What was supposed to be an exhilarating rite of passage - diving into the exciting, fast-paced world of first experiences - is quickly skewed by an incomprehensible depression. Surrounded by strong women - his untraditional Spanish mother more interested in being a confidante than mother his sister, a comedic, door-slamming tormentor, navigating her parent's divorce in her own disastrous ways and Aida, the silver-haired emotional focal point now on the verge of death - Oliver struggles to maintain both his sanity and his role as "man of the house." With his best friends and all their bad influences by his side, Oliver experiences attacks of mania, drunkenness, first love, betrayal, migraine-inducing masturbation, virginity, and the loss of a close friend, all in the hopes of surviving this New York-style baptism by fire.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Sure, there's nothing new to the rebellion and acting out that comes with puberty and growing older, but by framing it within the scope of this particular familial structure, it allows the film to be more than just your typical coming-of-age drama.</Review>
            <Review>Where Night Has Settled succeeds best is in the language, the left-unsaids and what-might-have-beens between characters, and in the disquieting textures of a too-close mother/son relationship.</Review>

        <Duration>112</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Writer/director Albert Lewin, ever on the lookout for esoteric story material that would accommodate his fascination with Egyptian sculpture and feline symbolism, managed to inject both into The Private Affairs of Bel Ami. Though based on a Guy de Maupassant story, Bel Ami seems to have been written by Oscar Wilde, another of Lewin's pets (e.g. The Picture of Dorian Gray). George Sanders plays an epigrammatic Parisian journalist, who rises to the top through the "kindnesses" of the various influential women that he's seduced and abandoned. This 19th-century rake's progress is ultimately halted by a duel, and somehow we're sorry that we don't get to see Sanders pull off at least one more caddish trick to save himself. Echoes from Lewin's previous works include his insertion of a Technicolor sequence (as he'd done in Dorian Gray and The Moon and Sixpence). George Sanders' stepping-stone ladies include Angela Lansbury, Frances Dee, Ann Dvorak, Marie Wilson, Katherine Emery and Susan Douglas.</StoryLine>

            <Review>What really distinguishes this... is its candid-and surprisingly flippant-treatment of widespread drug use in major league baseball.</Review>
            <Review>Radice does an honorable if not always scintillating job of paying tribute to a great team and a player with a phenomenal slider, whose politics and personal style pushed the sport's most racially ingrained boundaries.</Review>
            <Review>While the film's sense of chronology is at times strained and its tale of redemption hardly unique, its subject is certainly one of a kind.</Review>
            <Review>Radice talks with plenty of Ellis' teammates, family members and charmed-then-beleaguered wives, and he makes good use of archival interviews and footage in constructing his engaging portrait of a complicated but vivid sports figure.</Review>
            <Review>As this smart and sympathetic profile shows, Dock Ellis didn't need a no-hitter, stoned or otherwise, to define himself; he was his own best work.</Review>
            <Review>Unfailingly entertaining and occasionally even mind-blowing.</Review>

            <Review>Although the LSD no-hitter was likely never to have happened, there are enough wild stories about a 60s wild man to keep you captivated.</Review>

            <Review>Zoolander 2 takes pains to reference every successful gag you remember from the original, and then embellish them in painful-often offensive, almost always outdated-fashion.</Review>
            <Review>The first film scored a few palpable hits, but the new one barely makes the effort, and the poise of a work like "Funny Face," which both mocked and f√™ted a devotion to couture, seems an impossible dream.</Review>
            <Review>There are some clever bits and the satire is at times scathing but, on the whole, moments of hilarity are like oases in a desert of tedium. When Zoolander 2 isn't funny, the silliness strains the viewer's patience.</Review>
            <Review>While all comedies get refined in the editing room, this one feels like it was slapped together there, as Stiller - who also directed - searched for laughs.</Review>
            <Review>How bad is Zoolander 2? It's Batman and Robin bad.</Review>
            <Review>It is merely dumb when it should be knowingly dumb; satirically dull when it should be sharp; and just plain ugly when it should be, at the very least, aesthetically minded.</Review>
            <Review>Failing to tap into practically any of the charm of its predecessor is Zoolander 2, a supposed comedy devoid of practically any creativity and humor.</Review>

            <Review>"Risen" is a fascinating cultural artifact, but as a film, it's destined for no glory greater than as an appropriate cable rerun on Easter.</Review>
            <Review>For a film that could have easily become bogged down in Sunday School reverence, or culture-war opportunism, Risen presents an intriguing, oblique approach to a Bible movie.</Review>
            <Review>Whatever your religious affiliation, you will come away thinking that if all this did actually happen, it probably happened something like this.</Review>
            <Review>Despite not doing much more than preach to the choir, Risen is still more nuanced than the lion's share of recent faith-based dramas.</Review>
            <Review>It's pointed about how we treat today's zealots, as when Clavius likens the pain of crucification to "sucking air through a wet cloth" - a description of waterboarding.</Review>
            <Review>Risen isn't a film that will convert nonbelievers, but it's more ambitious than the standard faith-based genre fare.</Review>
            <Review>Risen is a reasonably decent movie, ideal for a young teenage audience. However, most adults will see it as little more than a reasonably clever whodunnit spin on the Resurrection.</Review>
            <Review>While Kevin Reynolds does try to do something a little different with Risen than we're used to seeing, it ultimately can't overcome its shoddy pacing and uneventful storyline, turning this into a rather forgettable biblical outing.</Review>

            <Review>Rise of the Legend's jumble of backstories, flashbacks, and betrayals can't hope to carry the same weight as its punches.</Review>
            <Review>Chow and To don't tinker with the lore's DNA too much, but fortunately they have Peng to freshen it up, and even the specter of Li does little to detract from his emerging star power.</Review>
            <Review>Rise of the Legend has some breathtaking action sequences and can boast how strong both Eddie Peng and Sammo Hung are in their roles, but dilutes itself with overacting and long stretches of unbearably emotional theatrics.</Review>

        <StoryLine>The Lives of Hamilton Fish is a musical experimental fantasy film based on actual events. A serial killer and a statesman, both named Hamilton Fish die on the same day: Hamilton Fish II, a descendant of one of the most prominent families in New York State and Hamilton "Albert" Fish, a psychopath, raised in an orphanage, who becomes the most notorious child murderer of his time. The editor who publishes their obituaries becomes obsessed with this coincidence and imagines how their lives intersect by bringing their stories into an imagined fantasy. The film's narrative is told entirely through songs sung using the editor's voice and perspective. The editor is a man played by a female. Through this voice all characters reveal themselves. What makes the film entirely unique is the way characters emerge from the editor's mind and sing in a single, female, voice.</StoryLine>

            <Review>More likely to dull by repetitive creep than memorably rattle the senses.</Review>
            <Review>The director's Polanski preoccupation borders on imitation. Still, Keating's flattery is sincere, and so is his wish to stylishly freak you silly.</Review>
            <Review>Keating ... crafts his own stylish take on the psycho and haunting genres in between winks to the classics.</Review>
            <Review>Using the simplest of settings - and familiar genre devices - Mickey Keating's horror outing "Darling" manages to conjure an effectively unsettling miasma.</Review>
            <Review>Thanks to excellent work from Carter, creepy and big-eyed innocent as required and strong throughout the 75-minute film, Darling holds its own as a satisfyingly deliberate-moving thriller.</Review>
            <Review>Keating, and his leading lady Carter, are horror masters in the making.</Review>
            <Review>An unconventionally conceived workplace horror movie and surreal home invasion thriller. But more impressively visual than visceral, as cityscape craft upstages storytelling, conceding to gore that ultimately loses its way in search of character depth.</Review>
            <Review>Keating keeps his cards close, a common conceit of the films he's referencing: Repulsion, Rosemary's Baby, The Innocents, Persona, just to name a few. Does he succeed? You'd better believe it.</Review>
            <Review>A stylish exercise in horror tropes... may be little more than an imitation, but at least the models are first-rate.</Review>
            <Review>For all its attempts to startle, the most startling thing about Darling is how off-target this promising director's third feature film is.</Review>
            <Review>The playfully subversive twists in this slow-burning, black-and-white trifle of experimental horror are more frightening separately than collectively.</Review>
            <Review>It's an immaculate work of art and one of the most affecting horror movies I've ever seen.</Review>

            <Review>A horrifically bad romantic comedy that serves as a celebration of entitlement, consumerism, and shallow behavior.</Review>
            <Review>This concept of single still assumes that a woman must have a man, that a girl's only choice is between one boyfriend or 20.</Review>
            <Review>Nothing here will blow you away -- think of this one as taking baby steps away from what's formulaic.</Review>
            <Review>It's chickbait for Valentine's weekend, a fluffball that plays like warmed-over subplots from Sex and the City.</Review>
            <Review>It ... exists in a candy-coated New York where everyone has infinite money, exactly six nonwhite people ever speak and Christmas is always gently covered with pristine, powdery snow.</Review>
            <Review>Think of "How to Be Single" as a cinematic Whitman's Sampler: There are enough pieces that work to offset the pieces that don't.</Review>
            <Review>How to Be Single doesn't succeed in its mission to add a new lease of life to the rom-com formula, but when taken with a pinch of salt (or tequila), it has just enough laughs to warrant a right swipe.</Review>
            <Review>If only How to Be Single had the smarts to not just deliver twists on clich√©s, but avoid them altogether.</Review>
            <Review>It is refreshing that new movie How To Be Single is, for once, truly comfortable with the notion that women need not be paired off to lead fulfilling lives.</Review>
            <Review>How to Be Single shows that rom-coms can be artfully made and intelligent, rather than dumb and pandering.</Review>
            <Review>How to Be Single gets some things right - relationships are messy - but despite the lesson of the title, this film reverts to standard rom-com, the result of either a lack of conviction or just wanting to tell women what they want to hear.</Review>
            <Review>Wilson generates a number of heartfelt laughs, Johnson is a magnetically compelling lead and Mann is just plain spectacular, stealing every scene she's in with an effortlessness that's just plain super.</Review>

            <Review>The U.K.'s oldest extant punk band gets a suitably entertaining, fractious documentary tribute.</Review>
            <Review>People who don't even care about the music will likely find [it] compelling.</Review>

            <Review>A thorough, even-handed look back at [the] history, cultural significance and the colorful, clashing personalities within the seminal punk band.</Review>
            <Review>The NY-based Orshoski does a good job outlining the UK punk scene for US audiences; along the way, perhaps inadvertently, he helps illustrate just how out of step with their contemporaries The Damned's larks were.</Review>
            <Review>Blistering, hilarious, and terrifically neat, neat, neat.</Review>
            <Review>Don't You Wish That We Were Dead is a fascinating, rambling saga that emanates a rich, sometimes morose, sense of what it's really like to have a whole life defined by the oh-so-brief explosion that was punk rock.</Review>

            <Review>A somewhat shaggy structure finds its footing in the film's second half. And the moment when we hear a sitar move seamlessly from an Eastern melody into the opening notes of Dave Brubeck's Take Five is one of pure symphonic bliss.</Review>
            <Review>The first third of the film is cluttered with too many people and lots of information without much to look at. But when East meets West in the concert hall and produces glorious music, none of that matters.</Review>
            <Review>The film ends on an upbeat note, but it is not easy being a musician in Pakistan. In the film, a musician points to an article in a Lahore newspaper about a musician who was murdered, just because he was a musician.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Based on Colin Harrison's acclaimed novel Manhattan Nocturne (a New York Times Notable Book of the Year), MANHATTAN NIGHT tells the story of Porter Wren (Adrien Brody), a New York City tabloid writer with an appetite for scandal. On the beat he sells murder, tragedy and anything that passes for the truth. At home he is a model family man, devoted to his loving wife (Jennifer Beals). But when a seductive stranger (Yvonne Strahovski) asks him to dig into the unsolved murder of her filmmaker husband Simon (Campbell Scott), he can't resist. In this modern version of a classic film noir, we follow Porter as he is drawn into a very nasty case of sexual obsession and blackmail - one that threatens his job, his marriage, and his life.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Director DeCubellis is frightfully beholden to the tropes of the genre, and the premise (involving blackmail, strange dares and an inexplicable horse story) is just not credible.</Review>
            <Review>The thrilling twists and turns of Harrison's plot are here, but DeCubellis's hazy pacing drains the film of the book's zest. Though great material mishandled is frustrating to view, there are nonetheless some bright spots.</Review>
            <Review>It's pretty frustrating to watch a close-but-no-cigar movie like this.</Review>
            <Review>It's not a great movie but a welcome one, if only for how it attempts to revive a whole genre.</Review>
            <Review>What sounds so delicious in the telling is pallid and ludicrous onscreen.</Review>
            <Review>"Manhattan Night" gets by on the strength of its visuals and a few vivid central performances, but by the time we find out whodunit, it doesn't really matter.</Review>
            <Review>Manhattan Night isn't a great example of the genre, but it's the best you'll get this side of 1959.</Review>
            <Review>The best noir films are as dry as their heroes; the self-consciousness of Manhattan Night makes it awfully hard to appreciate the things it does well.</Review>
            <Review>It's bogged down by hackneyed characters that do no justice to the film noir titles it tries to emulate.</Review>
            <Review>... generates some mild suspense, but ultimately it's too convoluted and far-fetched to allow for any investment in the payoff.</Review>
            <Review>It's almost as if some actual drama pokes through the movie despite the better efforts of DeCubills' strange fealty to straightforward genre conventions.</Review>

            <Review>The Witch is sparing in its use of special effects and generates suspense and foreboding through what is suggested rather than what is seen.</Review>
            <Review>In the tradition of William Friedkin's The Exorcist, this chilling low-budget horror movie taps into the same temporal fear that sparks religious feeling.</Review>
            <Review>"The Witch" feels at once sticky with tangible detail and numinous with suggestion.</Review>
            <Review>I would prefer seeing a failed attempt at something different than a regurgitation of every modern horror trope. Yet The Witch proves unable to capitalize on being different.</Review>
            <Review>Helped by along by a great cast, a haunting soundtrack and terrific attention to period detail, The Witch is an auspicious feature debut for writer-director Robert Eggers.</Review>
            <Review>The Witch is wrapped up in its own views of religion, of sin, of feminine power, but more than anything else, it is wrapped up in itself.</Review>
            <Review>Robert Egger's directorial debut The Witch is a deeply unsettling experience that will leave a residual impression akin to a scar on the skin.</Review>
            <Review>Robert Eggers ramps up the tension by setting his tale in a familiar-yet-foreign locale and using the natural terror of isolation to prompt chills and thrills from audiences.</Review>
            <Review>An oppressive, claustrophobic and occasionally shocking feminist tale that's just as much about a young girl coming of age in a fundamental Christian household as it is wicked, broomstick-riding evil lurking in the woods.</Review>
            <Review>One of the most stimulating and rewarding films in either of is genres - horror and costume drama - that one could hope to find.</Review>
            <Review>With very basic camera work, debutant director Robert Eggers manages to creep us out like no other. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Those looking for something different will be surprised, while some fans of the genre might be put off by this cinematic experience. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>

            <Review>A taut, darkly comic drama about the dilemmas of international intervention in civil war, all of it neatly symbolized by one elusive length of rope. It is also, sadly, a film much marred by its sexism.</Review>
            <Review>A Perfect Day is a war story told on a small scale. It's all the more powerful for its subtlety.</Review>
            <Review>This is one of those rare, thoughtful war movies that doesn't emphasize brutality.</Review>
            <Review>With an eclectic soundtrack, well-timed editing and crisp cinematography - and of course that terrific cast led by the great Del Toro - A Perfect Day is a rough-edged gem.</Review>
            <Review>The film may be scattershot and odd, but it needs to be odder still.</Review>
            <Review>Del Toro's low-key resignation gives the film what power it has, but the female characters (played by M√©lanie Thierry and Olga Kurylenko) are disappointingly thin.</Review>
            <Review>Gets by on the gentle interplay between the double act of Del Toro and Robbins (the comedy duo we've been waiting for!)</Review>
            <Review>[de Aranoa is] a director at home with the small things that can make a film great -- interested in what keeps people together when everything around them is being blown apart. It's a wonderful gift.</Review>
            <Review>Del Toro and Robbins adroitly capture the dark humour of the drama, and their scenes together are gems of bleak comedy.</Review>
            <Review>What the film does well is to immerse us in the tragic weirdness of wartime logic, where nothing works as we would expect. It's a strong, engaging film about how hard it is to wage peace.</Review>
            <Review>Hardly the most uplifting film of 2016, but does cast a caustic spell that carries it a long way.</Review>
            <Review>The searing insights are presented with minimal flourish and with riveting storytelling.</Review>

            <Review>Southbound delivers more than its fair share of pulpy, grisly thrills with its quintet of creepy tales set on a suitably desolate stretch of highway.</Review>
            <Review>What makes Southbound stand out is how all-round solid it is, its scary segments joined by a setting (driving through the desert) and a theme (guilt).</Review>
            <Review>Southbound strives for unity and mostly succeeds.</Review>
            <Review>"Southbound" packs a punch.</Review>
            <Review>Despite its occasional slack, Southbound is still tightly knotted where so many other films of its type are frayed at the seams.</Review>
            <Review>This entertaining-enough quartet of loosely interwoven terror tales falls right into the middle ground of horror omnibuses, with no outright duds but no truly memorable (or scary) segments either.</Review>
            <Review>Abstract and eerily incomplete, Southbound unfolds in a place where Marienbad heads south to the Twilight Zone and Dead End, and where moral failings collide with macabre consequences.</Review>
            <Review>A powerful variation on the multi-story film. SOUTHBOUND is five horrific stories, each of which fades into the next.</Review>
            <Review>The horror anthology Southbound is a hit-or-miss affair, a bunch of half-formed ideas that never coalesce into a satisfying shocker.</Review>
            <Review>Southbound, is terse, significant work, efficiently felling frights and dread in a manner that may even resound with general audiences as well as genre aficionados.</Review>
            <Review>It's a solid shocker throughout, with horror icon Larry Fessenden as our radio DJ guide to the menacing morality lessons.</Review>
            <Review>There's something beautifully sandy and gritty about the majority of Southland's stories. America's highways are a never ending dustbowl of horror, interspersed with sad motels and grim gas stations and the atmosphere is enjoyably unsettling.</Review>

            <Review>The pic is compelling for the most part, with Jones' riveting performance as the alternately sympathetic and nasty protagonist anchoring the proceedings.</Review>
            <Review>"Dementia" is the rare low-budget suspense movie that values performance and character over hooky concepts and cheap thrills.</Review>
            <Review>It's an assured, deftly acted movie that builds its creepiness slowly and keeps its secrets well hidden till the end.</Review>
            <Review>As a suspense film, Dementia is solid but unremarkable, even considering its ugly snarl of an ending. But hidden underneath, the film has all the elements for a compelling, sharp-edged family drama.</Review>
            <Review>As good as Dementia is, its chief strength lies in [Gene] Jones' mesmerizing performance.</Review>
            <Review>Any horror or suspense film worth its salt raises the audience's hackles at least once, but Dementia is a wimpy psychological thriller.</Review>
            <Review>Frankly, Dementia is just too clumsy to ever be thrilling.</Review>
            <Review>Too much of the tale is also done strictly by the numbers.</Review>
            <Review>May not be a crowd-pleaser, but it's a movie that will stick with those who see it.</Review>
            <Review>The film doesn't quite earn Gene Jones's performance, but it engenders considerable goodwill for allowing him to give it.</Review>
            <Review>Dementia is a B-grade psychological thriller, but it often aspires to be much more, and as good as the performances are and as tight as the script might be Testin in arguably the chief reason for that.</Review>
            <Review>Is Gene Jones the best late bloomer Hollywood has to offer? Dementia proves it.</Review>

            <Review>This is one sluggish curse that wouldn't wake even Sleeping Beauty.</Review>
            <Review>This movie is just over 80 minutes, and it feels like (a) they're stretching to fill that much, since so much of what happens is redundant; and (b) that they didn't actually do a lot of takes, since so many of these conversations are stilted.</Review>
            <Review>Nothing to see here.</Review>
            <Review>Well, the brothers Grimm are credited in the opening titles for the story of Briar Rose, but were they still alive, they might have passed on that favor.</Review>

            <Review>Beth Harrington has directed with skill and smarts and Mike Olson contributes terrific photoanimations to make the pre-Selfie Era come alive on screen. Once Johnny starts singing--alone, with June, and/or with anyone else--the soundtrack is pure pleasure.</Review>

            <Review>An inversion of Lawrence of Arabia -- a film told from the perspective of Arab bedouins rather than colonial adventurers, a scrappy coming of age story rather than a grand tale of epic, colonial ambitions.</Review>
            <Review>The effectiveness of the story hinges largely on Al-Hwietat, whose performance is both convincing wide-eyed and complex.</Review>
            <Review>The burden rests on Eid's shoulders, and he more than carries it. He's a natural, showing us Theeb's curiosity, loyalty and ingenuity while still retaining the innocence of a boy who has been sheltered from the world outside the desert.</Review>
            <Review>First-time director Naji Abu Nowar rehearsed his largely nonprofessional cast for almost a year before shooting began, and as the title character, Jacir Eid beautifully conveys a mix of emotions, from wonder to fear to determination.</Review>
            <Review>The further this strikingly assured debut feature by the British-born director Naji Abu Nowar goes along, the more it seems a metaphor for fierce self-determination - an origin story for Middle Eastern discontents.</Review>
            <Review>A disarmingly complex boyhood adventure with no shortage of tension or harsh beauty, "Theeb" marks a winning debut feature for co-writer and director Naji Abu Nowar.</Review>

            <Review>This is a movie that desperately wants to be a raunchy, politically incorrect, gross-out comedy. It gets as far as desperate.</Review>
            <Review>Nothing is rendered in a particularly funny or novel way - it's just crude, shocking statements. Therefore, the film isn't actually offensive because it's trying so hard to be and failing miserably.</Review>
            <Review>Tinged with the sadness of watching a beloved elderly relative making a bloody old fool of himself.</Review>
            <Review>"Dirty Grandpa" is like watching a friend's mediocre improv troupe do an extended spring-break sketch. And your friend just happens to be Robert De Niro.</Review>
            <Review>Crude in nearly every sense of the word, "Dirty Grandpa" is a nasty-humored, poorly made and desperately unfunny film.</Review>
            <Review>Though many of these self-consciously crude jokes don't land, those that do are the life of the party. Late-era De Niro forever, y'all.</Review>
            <Review>Equal parts bad and baffling, it seems to have been written and directed by alien life forms who read YouTube comment sections for a week and drew these conclusions about human behavior.</Review>
            <Review>A burlesque like Dirty Grandpa means to "liberate the oppressed" and does so in a low-comedy way. Ignore the bluenose critics who sharpened their dentures on this movie; ironically, they're the same fools who swallow drivel like The Hunger Games.</Review>
            <Review>No matter how many brief yucks you get out of Plaza's sledge hammer advances or De Niro attempting the kind of fast talking sex talk; you feel desperation.</Review>
            <Review>Pure comedy sewage.</Review>
            <Review>A movie so annoying, so ugly, so lead-footed, so misguided, and so blisteringly unfunny it has to be seen to be believed. Please don't see it, though. It's not worth the sacrifice.</Review>
            <Review>Though there are some polite, heartfelt moments about living life to the full, Dirty Grandpa is an arrangement of outrageous lines and sight gags for those who like their comedy crude, if somewhat pointless.</Review>

            <Review>"Pel√©" is hagiography. But appealing hagiography.</Review>
            <Review>The story of Brazilian soccer's ascension to the world stage is a remarkable one, and the film would have benefitted if the Zimbalists had found a way to add a bit of depth - or even doubt - to the legend.</Review>
            <Review>The rags to riches story of the first 17 years in the life of soccer superstar Pel√© are covered in this painfully routine biopic.</Review>
            <Review>It's as if Pel√© is no longer a flesh-and-blood character, but a cog in an inspiration machine that pumps out manufactured conflict and expected victory.</Review>
            <Review>Between the whitewashing factors and the very familiar narrative beats, there's a lot of this movie that's not much more than a tolerable drag.</Review>
            <Review>A social and sporting claim for the disheartened state of Brazilian football. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Not one of those horrible biopics we've seen lately, but nothing that stands out either. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Soccer fans won't get a kick from this lackluster biopic of one of the game's all-time greats.</Review>
            <Review>When the movie is only 22 minutes old the first time it depicts a crowd chanting Pel√©'s name, be glad it showed some restraint and waited that long.</Review>
            <Review>It is a portrait of a player and his country, and even if the film takes a conventional route to its destination, fans of the game should still enjoy it.</Review>
            <Review>Alas, the script plods along from event to event, and the young actors portraying Pel√© are bland and uninvolving.</Review>

        <StoryLine>When an undercover cop gets too close to revealing the mastermind of a drug syndicate, his cover is blown. Double-crossed and under a false identity, he's thrown into a Thai prison, where a guard discovers the inmate - claiming he's a cop - is a bone marrow match for his dying daughter...and his warden may have an even deadlier operation hidden within the prison walls. In this giddily frenetic follow-up (though not a sequel) to modern martial arts epic Kill Zone (aka SPL: Sha Po Lang), action icons Tony Jaa (Ong-Bak, The Protector) and Zhang Jin (Ip Man 3) team up with Hong Kong megastars Simon Yam, Wu Jing, and Louis Koo for a breakneck story of dirty cops, prison riots, and black market organ transplants, all brought together by a non-stop series of inventive, bone-crunching setpieces.</StoryLine>

            <Review>If you like action films, you need to see "Kill Zone 2."</Review>
            <Review>Mostly, just as "SPL" did with Yen, this sequel serves as an ideal showcase for talented martial artists.</Review>
            <Review>If there's one rewarding thing about many Hong Kong action directors, it's that they rarely dawdle in getting to what fight fans have come for: bracing shootouts and high-impact fisticuffs and footwork.</Review>
            <Review>What makes Kill Zone 2 remarkable is the head-pounding martial-arts action, a ballet of brutality that makes up in murderous choreography what it lacks in narrative cohesion. No one goes to a movie called Kill Zone 2 for plot anyway.</Review>
            <Review>Cheang keeps the movie in a state of exaggerated emotion; it opens with the choral "Lacrimosa" from Mozart's Requiem and a slow-mo shot tinted arterial red, and rarely lets up from there.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately the story is secondary to the action, which rarely lets up and never lets viewers down.</Review>
            <Review>With fierce action, impressive acting, and a compelling storyline, Kill Zone 2 is the first worthy Tony Jaa film to come along since The Protector.</Review>
            <Review>Director Soi Cheang gives the audience plenty to look at in this violent ode to male bonding and family values.</Review>
            <Review>Its very foundation is built on coincidences, which add excess density to an already dense narrative. But Cheang keeps the threads straight, which is as impressive a feat as any of his film's stunts.</Review>
            <Review>Stylistically free but still cleanly delineated in character and crime-film structure, there comes a clear direction for the 21st-century action film.</Review>
            <Review>Unlike certain recent Hong Kong movies that got bogged down in moralizing... Kill Zone 2 delivers the goods in this post-Raid environment.</Review>
            <Review>Underneath a strange, body-horror plot lies a blistering Hong Kong action movie with the type of bone-crunching fight scenes that genre fans crave.</Review>

            <Review>Deriving inspiration from a certain famed Arthur Miller play and reframing it for the era of rampant, media-invoked Satanic Panic fears, "Regression" provocatively blankets its elegiac mystery in a malignant pall of diabolical foreboding.</Review>
            <Review>This is a movie that, because it deals with secrets, promises thrills and possibly a measure of terror; but, in fact, everything is based on an anti-climax, and the result is a resounding "so what?"</Review>

        <StoryLine>The setting is New York, 5 minutes in the future. The glorious technological advances and communication devices of the near future meant to increase connectivity and alleviate boredom are only increasing the anxiety level of the insecure New Yorkers who've inherited them. David (writer/director Benjamin Dickinson) is an overworked, tech-addled advertising executive developing a high-profile marketing campaign for a new generation of Augmented Reality glasses. Feeling stuck in his relationship with yoga teacher Juliette (Nora Zehetner, BRICK, IFC's "Maron"), he envies the charmed life of his best friend, fashion photographer Wim (Dan Gill, THE WEDDING RINGER) and his entrancing girlfriend Sophie (Alexia Rasmussen, CALIFORNIA SOLO) - so he uses the glasses to develop a life-like avatar of her. Unwittingly, fantasy and reality begin to blur. As passions escalate and things get increasingly out of hand, the friends are forced to deal with the impending collision between their public, private and imaginary lives.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Creative Control looks more interesting than it is.</Review>
            <Review>While it hits some of the usual sci-fi tropes, Creative Control's center of gravity isn't tech itself, but the relationships of those who use it.</Review>
            <Review>Even after establishing David as a panicky wreck addicted to his morning Xanax chewables and evening booze, the movie doesn't dramatize his ensuing breakdown so that it makes sense or generates much sympathy.</Review>
            <Review>At times, I felt like I was out on a date with "Creative Control," only to find the movie kept checking its hair in the mirror every five minutes.</Review>
            <Review>Like Antonioni, Dickinson is less interested in narrative structure and character development, but there's a problem here: He has nothing new to say about technology, alienation and the lost art of romance.</Review>
            <Review>The people in this future are shallow, selfish and depressing.</Review>
            <Review>As technology causes humans to drift further apart emotionally, that's a problem the film itself can't reconcile.</Review>
            <Review>Shot in black-and-white, with some smartly strategic use of color, Creative Control has a sleek, polished look that belies its indie beginnings.</Review>
            <Review>It's not easy to make a satire like this without crankiness, or to bring a new talent to the buckshotting of that sitting duck known as Nouveau Brooklyn, where "Namaste" is the Tibetan word for "f--- you."</Review>
            <Review>A legitimately stylish close to a strainingly trendy film, suggesting that Dickinson may indeed have some talent if he could only get over himself.</Review>
            <Review>It captures Brooklyn's trendy Williamsburg neighborhood in a whole new light. Shame the film couldn't do the same with its lame attempts at satire. But, hey, that's reality. And as we all know, it bites.</Review>

            <Review>A messy, hectic, fitfully amusing film-nerd farce.</Review>
            <Review>To be sure, Greenaway's sensibilities may not be for everyone, but in the years to come, this is an artist whose work will be studied. It's a pleasure seeing him come out to play.</Review>
            <Review>Greenaway's madcap style involves quick cuts, scenes changing from black and white to color, split-screen effects and eye-popping visuals that tend to overwhelm. The effect is initially giddy but it ultimately wears the viewer down.</Review>
            <Review>Fans of Greenaway's work - a mix of the brainy, the controversial and the grotesque - won't necessarily be surprised by any of this. They may, however, be disappointed at how little of it actually works.</Review>
            <Review>This interpretation may not be strictly factual, but it's a persuasive narrative and it brings out the strongest instincts in Greenaway, whose most popular movie remains "The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover."</Review>
            <Review>The film's hyperactivity ultimately wears you down. Is it possible to give a movie Ritalin? "Eisenstein in Guanajuato" makes you want to try.</Review>
            <Review>The main character preferences, in the creative process of the portrait that builds Greenaway, is anything but conventional. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Eisenstein in Guanajuato certainly bursts out with a picaresque energy and voluminous scale that is as impressive as anything Greenaway has made in a long time.</Review>
            <Review>It's never quite as funny or stylistically insightful as it thinks.</Review>
            <Review>Formally dazzling, emotionally empty.</Review>
            <Review>As always with Greenaway, the dialogue tends towards the florid and the intellectual. Nevertheless, he remains a master image-maker and an irrepressible subversive.</Review>
            <Review>Peter Greenaway's latest, Eisenstein in Guanajuato, may not be up everyone's street, and even fans may find the self-indulgent longueurs towards the end of the film too much. Still, the premise is interesting.</Review>

            <Review>Having such a small number of characters, like the limitations caused by budgetary constraints, might sound like a recipe for creative claustrophobia, but Gentry turns these givens to his advantage ...</Review>
            <Review>"Synchronicity," a low-budget misfire about time and love, could use some exploding heads, dialogue and ideas.</Review>
            <Review>Sententiousness can be enjoyable when it's intentional and dispensed in small doses. "Synchronicity" gets the dosage wrong.</Review>
            <Review>A dialogue-heavy genre exercise that's smart about the philosophical implications of messing with the timeline but sophomoric when it comes to telling a good story.</Review>
            <Review>The film could double as a metaphor for itself, a time machine constructed entirely of used components, with so little distance from its influences that it lacks its own utility.</Review>
            <Review>Gentry's script plays cleverly within the rules of the sandbox it creates, and its introduction of romantic themes and a fully believable relationship help, but Synchronicity doesn't quite get where it means to go.</Review>
            <Review>Synchronicity is a wonderfully clever sci-fi outing that rises above certain trappings that would have ultimately tripped up a director with a lesser vision and ability at the helm.</Review>
            <Review>A thought-provoking but clumsy sci-fi time bender.</Review>
            <Review>... features some intriguing science-fiction concepts overwhelmed by plenty of pretentious gibberish.</Review>
            <Review>A lot of homage and genre too often get in the way of what could have been a well-paced, smart story</Review>
            <Review>It's one to see twice, at least, and I'm already looking forward to my second go at this world.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>The most salient point Moore makes in "Where to Invade Next" is that so many of the ideas explored in the doc are American, historically speaking.</Review>
            <Review>This is sociology for dummies - and even they might find Moore's points overly laboured.</Review>
            <Review>For anyone who's never seen a Michael Moore film and wants the entire experience at once -- it's all here.</Review>
            <Review>[Moore has] made his most enjoyable film in years and also his most inspiring, the antidote to prevailing global doom and gloom.</Review>
            <Review>Occasionally poignant but ham-handed and only semi-funny.</Review>
            <Review>Moore, taking on his everyman role, delights in sharing that many of the programs and policies he highlights are founded on American ideals.</Review>
            <Review>The main problem about Moore's work is that some things can't be summarized in ten minutes. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>The wishy-washy execution means it is unlikely to win over anyone who doesn't already agree.</Review>
            <Review>If Where to Invade Next isn't exactly forensic it is funny and thought-provoking.</Review>
            <Review>Moore's methods can be off-putting, but he gets results. This is entertainment, but you'll learn something.</Review>
            <Review>By now we know that Moore is far from an objective maker of documentaries; his films always have their own slant, but despite that, it's hard to refute some of the good ideas here.</Review>
            <Review>Fans of Moore will appreciate his ideas behind the film. Those who aren't probably won't. To them I suggest moving to Germany, where your local doctor can write you a prescription for a three-week stay at a posh spa to relieve the tension.</Review>

            <Review>Janis: Little Girl Blue vividly and often poignantly revisits her short life -- and hard and fast times.</Review>
            <Review>Documentary filmmaker Amy Berg (West of Memphis, Prophet's Prey) has made an elegant, affectionate and, in many ways, remarkably cheerful film about Janis Joplin.</Review>
            <Review>It's a wonderful portrait...and it is richly layered.</Review>
            <Review>Fine, judicious, generous portrait of a lady who sang the blues.</Review>
            <Review>"Baby I know just how you feel," she sang. And no one doubted that at all.</Review>
            <Review>Despite the gloomy title and the subject's tragic demise, this valuable documentary of incendiary 1960s blues rocker Janis Joplin is actually more celebration than eulogy.</Review>
            <Review>It looks beyond the wild-child rock-chick cliche to find different shades of Joplin.</Review>
            <Review>It might now have information you can't find in any biography of the artist, but puts her personal life in a whole new light. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>An important film that helps us understand why so many great musicians are part of the 27 club. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Amy Berg explores a less known part of Janis Joplin's life in a very sweet way. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Amy Berg manages to maintain a balance between the rockstar and the human being. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>A much more contained and intimate documentary instead of the usual flashy narrative used in the genre. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>

        <StoryLine>ELSTREE 1976 explores the lives of the actors and extras behind one of the most celebrated franchises in cinematic history, which spans from George Lucas' original A NEW HOPE to J.J. Abrams' recent record-breaking blockbuster THE FORCE AWAKENS. From the man behind film's most iconic villain, to the actor whose character was completely cut from the final film, the documentary delves into the eccentric community these individuals have formed and how the Star Wars franchise continues to impact their lives decades later.</StoryLine>

            <Review>A deadpan documentary with notes of wistful irony ...</Review>
            <Review>Elstree 1976 isn't an essential movie for anyone but the most obsessive fanboy or girl. It's a film about the strange hand of fate, the wages of dumb luck, and the flipside of fame-life on the D-list.</Review>
            <Review>You're hearing some good stories told from the viewpoints of minor characters. This will hold your attention best if you are a "Star Wars" completist or a super-fan.</Review>
            <Review>The most interesting part of Elstree 1976 comes when these actors express ambivalence about their odd celebrity.</Review>
            <Review>In telling a small story of bit players, the director, Jon Spira, captures a more universal picture of the droplets of fame created by a pop-culture tidal wave.</Review>
            <Review>A sweet, quietly funny, fascinating and contemplative study of 10 character actors and extras, none of whom had any idea back in the 1970s they'd forever be defined by the one or two days they spent on the set of a sci-fi movie.</Review>
            <Review>Spira's take is undeniably affectionate, but offers little insight into the trilogy for Star Wars fans. Yet Elstree 1976 is so inextricably linked to George Lucas' space opera, it's difficult to imagine what the appeal could be ...</Review>
            <Review>Amid some amusing tidbits, most of the anecdotes aren't very compelling or insightful, and there's not much else.</Review>
            <Review>How many movies would inspire a documentary about its bit players, almost 40 years after its initial release? Very few, but "Star Wars" is certainly one of them.</Review>
            <Review>Elstree 1976 serves as a relevant Star Wars companion for fans big and small.</Review>
            <Review>It wears out its welcome after about an hour. It also raises a few questions that are left unanswered. But there's still enough here to make it worth a look for fans.</Review>
            <Review>The movie's major take-away? Dave Prowse deserves his own documentary.</Review>

            <Review>A Royal Night Out is a film of enormous charm, texture and good will, thanks largely to the three leads.</Review>
            <Review>It's jazzy fluff, but the film panders.</Review>
            <Review>What makes "A Royal Night Out" palatable are the lead performances.</Review>
            <Review>"A Royal Night Out" is a featherweight trifle.</Review>
            <Review>Unless viewers are aficionados of the old royal family, I'm not sure how interested they'll be in following two posh-accented young women chasing through drunken crowds in period dress, though Powley, in particular, is a charmer.</Review>
            <Review>The lovely performances, especially by Gadon and Powley, make the film a passably pleasing tale of teens gone slightly wild, with a royal twist.</Review>
            <Review>A Royal Night Out goes the zany romantic-comedy route in its fictional depiction of two British princesses partying with commoners at the end of World War II.</Review>
            <Review>Sarah Gadon is the heart of this historical comedy with great production values. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>

            <Review>Glassland smartly plays off Jean's unhinged disintegration against John's tense, subdued control. In that contrast lies the power of this film.</Review>
            <Review>A downbeat serving of kitchen-sink social realism with the sink itself thrown in for good measure.</Review>
            <Review>Glassland is a small film with an emotional punch that wallops above its weight class.</Review>
            <Review>This is a hard, spare, tough movie, at times nearly jarring in its lack of adornment.</Review>
            <Review>There's much in the movie to admire until it runs headlong into a stone wall.</Review>
            <Review>In the movie's best scene, as mother and son dance to an old pop song, the look on Reynor's face speaks volumes about loss and hope. It's a look that's going to be breaking hearts on screen for decades to come.</Review>
            <Review>You've seen stories of substance abuse and its effects on a family, but rarely one as deeply unsentimental and candid as this one.</Review>
            <Review>A harrowing Irish drama of a young man being torn apart by his mother's destructive alcoholism.</Review>
            <Review>It earns its tears, even if it skimps out on everything else.</Review>
            <Review>Glassland is impressive, although Barrett struggles to give this carefully crafted narrative a coherent resolution.</Review>
            <Review>The dialogue is sparse, and a certain plot point is so vague as to be positively confusing. But the actors accomplish a lot with a hooded look, a weary sigh and a guilty sip of wine.</Review>
            <Review>While the cast masterfully shoulders the sad affair, their efforts are undermined by Barrett's unfortunate tendency to tell when showing has already done the job.</Review>

            <Review>Breezy, intelligent, diffuse but uncluttered, Fredrik Gertten's documentary "Bikes vs Cars" could be called a tale of congestion-plagued cities.</Review>
            <Review>Director Fredrik Gertten breaks little new ground as he salts the picture with statistics in support of interviews with bicycle proponents to buttress his theme.</Review>
            <Review>Watching a teacher lead a group of schoolchildren around busy Bogot√° on their little bikes, teaching them how to safely navigate their city on their own power, you might feel hopeful for the future of eco-friendly transportation.</Review>
            <Review>This surprisingly critical portrayal of a cyclist's utopia raises all kinds of issues about traffic planning and bike safety that the doc does not address.</Review>
            <Review>That's the film's first shortcoming-namely, that it doesn't really make a single, lucid point.</Review>
            <Review>Some of the ideas of Bikes vs. Cars have merit, but many... have a noticeable whiff of able-ism, and the film pays only minor lip service to people for whom biking everywhere always is not an option.</Review>
            <Review>Reports from cities around the world about the need for bikes and the problems faced by bikers.</Review>
            <Review>Copenhagen is essentially a vision of the world the filmmaker Gertten yearns for, but he negates his thesis by presenting bike traffic in the city as a public nuisance.</Review>
            <Review>It might benefit... from taking on and deconstructing more of the opposing arguments, rather than simply relying on forwarding those of the cyclist lobby.</Review>
            <Review>The film's message is certainly distressing -- there's no way humans can survive this collective auto-da-f√© -- but at least the ride is fun.</Review>

        <StoryLine>As their parents head out for a date in the city, the three young Thompson children immediately take to their new babysitter, Anna (Sarah Bolger, Into the Badlands, Once Upon a Time), who seems like a dream come true: she's sweet, fun, and lets them do things that break all of their parents' rules. But as Anna's interactions with them take on a more sinister tone, the kids realize that their caretaker may not be who she claims to be. Soon it's up to big brother Jacob to protect his siblings from the increasingly nefarious intentions of a very disturbed woman whose weapon is trust, and whose target is innocence.

            <Review>The result is reasonably satisfying, but the direction shifts from tensile to muddy in the run-up to the finale.</Review>
            <Review>A familiarly premised but stringently executed home-invasion chiller that rarely goes for the straight-up scare when a more insidious one will do.</Review>
            <Review>Parents in the market for some deserved date-night distraction couldn't do much worse than "Emelie" - and that's meant as a compliment.</Review>
            <Review>Mr. Thelin plays with genre clich√©s without upending them, and the results are more creepy than scary, with shivers that are primarily generated by the sight of threatened children ...</Review>
            <Review>In some cases, a slow build is a necessary and effective way to up the scare factor. In this case, the slow build is painstakingly sluggish, a seemingly never-ending climb toward a climax that's not satisfying enough to be worth the wait.</Review>
            <Review>Herbeck's script pokes at the anxieties of parents who leave their kids alone with virtual strangers, while Bolger excels at playing the nightmare version of a babysitter: seemingly sweet, cool, and capable, but secretly evil.</Review>
            <Review>Not only could Emelie feasibly start a spate of similar psycho babysitter knock-offs if successful but it is also a great deal more interesting than most of its sub-genre predecessors.</Review>
            <Review>Creepy, claustrophobic and unnerving, this is the perfect warning against hiring anybody you find off Facebook.</Review>
            <Review>Moments are individually well-crafted but don't always work in the context of the movie as a whole.</Review>
            <Review>Where it does fall back on formula, Emelie is sufficiently well made to hold viewer attention and it succeeds in maintaining a degree of creepiness throughout.</Review>
            <Review>A fun, darkly intelligent twist on a story you think you know well, but one that sadly, like so many others, loses its way in the final act.</Review>
            <Review>There's still plenty about Emelie to creep you out of ever hiring a babysitter again.</Review>

            <Review>To paraphrase something Parton once said about herself: It may look fake, but it's real where it counts. What counts most is the acting, which lends the story a naturalism that the script can't.</Review>
            <Review>The story is a sweet one, and Coat of Many Colors does what it does very well.</Review>
            <Review>Although it's a struggle at times, you do suspend disbelief and go with it because Lind is so adorable, and you want to accept that the saccharine story line could have played out in real life just the way it's depicted in the film.</Review>
            <Review>It's a romanticized view of the past, to put it mildly, and it's as sticky sweet as the caramel apple cider you might find at Dollywood.</Review>
            <Review>Dolly Parton's Coat of Many Colors is a TV movie like mama used to make - a relentlessly faith-based holiday confection geared toward an audience that had reason to feel underserved by network television.</Review>
            <Review>It's refreshing to see such an unsanitized story of faith, family love, and overcoming adversity.</Review>
            <Review>Simply beautiful and beautifully simple.</Review>
            <Review>This is the time of year when sentimentality can be a warming thing, and Parton's Coat will keep an awful lot of people warm this winter.</Review>
            <Review>Just like Dolly Parton, who is one of the best live performers I've ever seen, it is immensely watchable. However, for those who don't regularly visit the house of the lord, it will make your eyes roll like loose marbles in the back of a station wagon.</Review>

            <Review>Atom Egoyan's bold but often ludicrous Remember plays a like a mash-up of The Terminator, Marathon Man and Memento, as filtered through the lens of an old Twilight Zone episode.</Review>
            <Review>There is no actor currently at work capable of embodying the complexity of this character like Plummer.</Review>
            <Review>A shaky premise meets a shaky protagonist in "Remember."</Review>
            <Review>There is too much convenient coincidence and less tension than a payback drama needs, but the cast is as good as always.</Review>
            <Review>Plummer is, by far, the best thing about the film.</Review>
            <Review>Plummer, against all odds, brings pathos and dignity to a role that doesn't deserve him.</Review>
            <Review>The film's real thrills are to be found in the fragility and confusion of Plummer's performance. At 85, few actors find leading roles and he's the oldest actor to have won an Oscar (for Beginners); he deserved better than this.</Review>
            <Review>Plummer himself is perfect for this role. There aren't too many others who could convincingly play a demented nonagenarian with such verve.</Review>
            <Review>Christopher Plummer gives a towering, affecting, prestige-level performance that sharpens the material around him...</Review>
            <Review>Canadian director Atom Egoyan offers his best work in ages with this quietly observant drama. Paying special attention to sounds, places, and tones, the movie turns unexpectedly moving and powerful.</Review>
            <Review>Plummer does fine work in the lead role, but the supporting players tend to go way over-the-top.</Review>
            <Review>[It] mainly uses the Holocaust as a plot point, looming in the far distance but rarely considered. The film is more about the danger of forgetting, a recurring theme for Canadian director Atom Egoyan.</Review>

            <Review>There's a poignant, powerful story lurking at the edges of "Jack of the Red Hearts" but, as is, the film proves a strained, implausible family drama.</Review>
            <Review>"Jack of the Red Hearts" is the movie equivalent of what used to be called a "problem play." As such, it is well done.</Review>
            <Review>From the opening scene [Robb] takes over the screen with a coltish toughness and mercurial charisma.</Review>
            <Review>It's rare that a drama shows such specificity with respect to the experience of coping with autism, and that sensitivity goes a long way.</Review>
            <Review>Jack of the Red Hearts depicts a bond between a troubled teenager and a young autistic girl ... The goodwill for its titular character never feels earned.</Review>
            <Review>Youth in social and economic crisis today converges with autism, and struggling to come of age in this troubled world. Based on the challenges of the director raising her own autistic child, and raw and real mixed with plenty of tough love empathy too.</Review>
            <Review>A dull, predictable melodrama that only pretends to be about autism.</Review>
            <Review>Good acting in thought-provoking but predictable drama.</Review>
            <Review>Showcases the talented young actress Taylor Richardson but never develops beyond placid afterschool-special territory.</Review>
            <Review>Grillo is one of the few filmmakers out there who possesses an understanding of autism and the drain of personal care, and she once again uses this knowledge to deepen material, giving it a perspective few productions dare to offer.</Review>
            <Review>A few POV shots provide us with insight and empathy. Too many of them simply devalue the POV impact and tend to give Jack of the Red Hearts the texture of an ABC Afterschool Special.</Review>

            <Review>For the most part, The Messenger does for songbirds what Winged Migration did for big birds.</Review>
            <Review>The slow-motion close-ups alone should convince you these magnificent creatures are well worth the effort.</Review>

            <Review>The filmmakers, like the songbirds they advocate for, are only messengers, but their message is persuasive and terrifying.</Review>

            <Review>We the people deserve every nutty coincidence, beautiful disaster, luxurious grief montage, and supernatural final-act reveal. Garbage-entertainment is still entertainment. Why, then, does The Choice almost entirely opt out of its own game?</Review>
            <Review>You feel manipulated, but not in the I-can't-help-but-be-moved way that these films usually work. By the time its finale rolls around, The Choice has completely undone its own spell.</Review>
            <Review>The latest Nicholas Sparks adaptation may turn off even his most ardent fans.</Review>
            <Review>Even when things take a turn, the movie doesn't become more complicated or interesting; we simply start down an equally predictable new track.</Review>
            <Review>The Choice feels like Mad Libs with some of Sparks' laziest clich√©s - a romantic rowboat, a colorful small-town carnival, a jealous upper-class boyfriend - and the result is a predictable, recycled mess.</Review>
            <Review>As usual, love will be declared, tears will be shed, rain will fall, stars will be gazed at and dogs will be shamelessly anthropomorphized by their owners.</Review>
            <Review>The Choice is another tired retread of Nicholas Sparks's favorite themes: good ol' Southern living, problematic women, and the specialness of love.</Review>
            <Review>What makes this film a notch above other cookie-cutter Sparks adaptations is a strong cast</Review>
            <Review>The thing that's particularly galling about his latest installment, The Choice, is that the script seems to think it delivers a sophisticated and witty battle of the sexes.</Review>
            <Review>Don't expect anything new other than what you already expect from this film. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>While The Choice certainly isn't for everyone, there is something refreshing to be wrung from such an unabashedly earnest and wholesome world view.</Review>
            <Review>Sticking unremittingly to its formulaic mould, The Choice - boasting all of the worst romantic movie tropes under the sun - is the definition of derivativeness, featuring plenty of hand-holding, eye-gazing and corny romantic exchanges.</Review>

            <Review>"Mojin" wastes some fine actors ... on predictable, one-dimensional characters, and once the tomb is entered, the underground sets become all but interchangeable. What starts eerie becomes strictly cartoonish.</Review>
            <Review>The tone can be uneven at times and the plot gets a little too busy, but Mojin does deliver some escapist fun.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>The movie's a shambles, alternatingly agreeable and aggravating, held together by our interest in its heroine and by Lawrence's tremendously sympathetic performance.</Review>
            <Review>Russell is almost totally uninterested in the story of how Joy Mangano explored a bizarre and unknown new business model and became its first self-made tycoon, and as a result we aren't interested either.</Review>
            <Review>Two years after Jennifer Lawrence appeared in David O. Russell's American Hustle, she gets to show some.</Review>
            <Review>Joy can be viewed as a modern day rags-to-riches fairytale. It's Cinderella without the prince. In a way, that's part of the film's charm.</Review>
            <Review>It's clear that the point here isn't people, it's payoff, emotional and otherwise.</Review>
            <Review>Perhaps people who make gazillions selling housewares on The Shopping Channel deserve to be honoured; if they do, Joy is not a fitting tribute to Mangano - nor to the mop.</Review>
            <Review>Having Jennifer Lawrence as a lead makes this film worth watching. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>The true joy in this movie is another standout performance from Lawrence and its definitely worth watching for that alone, however the story of the Miracle Mop inventor is seriously lacking in any kind of sparkle.</Review>
            <Review>It's a fascinatingly dysfunctional star vehicle, but given its apparent goals, a successful one.</Review>
            <Review>I am a huge Jennifer Lawrence fan -- I think she is an intuitive and smart actress -- and it's great that she's been given a part this meaty to sink her teeth into. And I get why Russell cast her... But boy oh boy, is she miscast.</Review>
            <Review>[Russell] is great at making the audience like his lovable underdogs; when he tries to lionise them, the effort feels insincere.</Review>
            <Review>Joy is worth seeing for Lawrence alone.</Review>

            <Review>Ultimately squashed by a silly and generic love triangle that makes The Hunger Games look like Casablanca.</Review>
            <Review>The storyline is generic apocalyptic science fiction and feels a lot like an uninspired fusion of Independence Day and the TV mini-series "V".</Review>
            <Review>The whole thing appears to have been designed by some crazed Oedipal wing of the N.R.A.</Review>
            <Review>The 5th Wave plays like a Wayans-brothers spoof of movies based on dystopian Young Adult novels. Seriously, it could have been called YA Movie the way it wallows in all the overly familiar tropes of the genre.</Review>
            <Review>The death and destruction in "The 5th Wave" can be highly entertaining, but once that's over, the movie must follow its predetermined formula.</Review>
            <Review>The 5th Wave is simultaneously boring and cringingly overwrought, with a bland protagonist, a completely nonsensical story, and another teen love triangle.</Review>
            <Review>The film feels rushed, the parallel storylines aren't equally satisfying and the CGI looks a bit too, well, CGI.</Review>

            <Review>Yes, there are some powerfully riveting moments and hordes of extremely watchable, athletic youngsters, but director J. Blakeson's film is a paint-by-numbers job that also leaves the ending, predictably, just hanging there.</Review>
            <Review>There's no way around the clunky exposition and rampant clich√©s that make up the majority of The 5th Wave.</Review>

            <Review>There's a great satire to be made about our modern interaction with journalists, and how gullible the American people can be when it comes to how reporters shape stories to their own benefit. "Special Correspondents" is not that movie.</Review>
            <Review>There's nothing wrong with the type of movie "Special Correspondents" wants to be. The problem is that Mr. Gervais doesn't appear capable of making a good version of it.</Review>
            <Review>Let me be clear: Nothing about Special Correspondents is relevant or interesting about media, warfare, or human nature.</Review>
            <Review>A tepid Gervais is better than no Gervais at all, and Special Correspondents has its moments, most of which are supplied by supporting cast members like America Ferrera and Vera Farmiga.</Review>
            <Review>What Gervais may have previously turned into a pointed satire of the news media instead becomes a flimsy farce that's surprisingly low on laughs.</Review>
            <Review>Lots of profanity, drugs in so-so satire.</Review>
            <Review>Gervais has missed the mark again with Special Correspondents, a lacklustre comedy that's big on absurdity but surprisingly low on laughs.</Review>
            <Review>A wasted opportunity. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Special Correspondents is like a mish-mash of some great ideas that go absolutely nowhere.</Review>
            <Review>This work is mildly satirical. The difference here is that the bite is so mild that this barely works as a satire.</Review>
            <Review>If Special Correspondents has one prominent problem - aside from running out of gas before the finish line - it is that no one player in the cast is prepared to step up and dominate when needed.</Review>

            <Review>Along with excellent work by cinematographer Stefan Duscio and composer Dale Cornelius, Petroni elicits sharp performances from his estimable cast, especially Adrien Brody.</Review>
            <Review>Fright fans more interested in thematic depth than visceral thrills may appreciate what writer-director Michael Petroni attempts, but even they'd likely admit there's not much to savor.</Review>
            <Review>The film is part psychological thriller, part horror movie, and the horror elements deliver some solid frights. Mr. Brody isn't asked to stretch much, but he does his usual thing adroitly.</Review>
            <Review>A movie that tries to make a choo-choo out of "The Sixth Sense" but immediately goes off the rails.</Review>
            <Review>Brody does his best, and that initial idea - of a shrink seeing spooks - is fun, even if it's awfully familiar. But the movie really doesn't stand up to further analysis.</Review>
            <Review>Glossily shot yet soullessly schematic ...</Review>
            <Review>Brody fills out his wafer-thin role with more conviction than it truly deserves, and like fellow former Best Actor Oscar-winner Nicolas Cage, is an expert at keeping a straight face in bent circumstances.</Review>
            <Review>Backtrack has a classy, downcast aesthetic that feels a bit like an old piece of furniture melted down and turned into celluloid, or a film infused with the fabric of a chesterfield.</Review>
            <Review>...all very silly and over the top...</Review>
            <Review>It's a decent story, but the film suffers from the muddling effect of ghost story mixed with thriller.</Review>
            <Review>Never mind that it is derivative, it is the lack of engagement in the film's first half that is its greatest problem as it struggles to straddle genres from that of the supernatural to thriller.</Review>
            <Review>The script from writer/director Michael Petroni is so ruthlessly focused on planting symbols and advancing menacing clues that the protagonist's journey into his own past begins to feel pre-ordained.</Review>

            <Review>O'Connor's movie is too sentimental and self-serious to add much of note to the mythos, but Portman embodies her character's grief no less movingly than her forebears.</Review>
            <Review>At times, Jane Got A Gun comes perilously close to staying passive-to becoming A Gun Was Gotten By Jane.</Review>
            <Review>As stripped-down, revisionist Westerns go, "Jane Got A Gun" may not have reinvented the wagon wheel, but it rolls out as a sturdy, well-crafted genre piece despite its rocky road to the screen.</Review>
            <Review>Whatever feminist angle the film might have once aspired to is lost in its listless shuffle.</Review>
            <Review>A Western with potential for feminist table-turning and old-fashioned violence, "Jane Got a Gun" is a major letdown. Despite being co-produced by Portman, the movie sells her character short at nearly every turn.</Review>
            <Review>Jane Got A Gun has the promise of a strong female leading Western; the by the numbers end result doesn't even barely eclipse the central trio's last time on screen.</Review>
            <Review>A rare misfire within Gavin O'Connor's otherwise solid body of work...</Review>
            <Review>It is hard to know what kind of audience this film was made for.</Review>
            <Review>The slow-burn build-up to a final showdown is, of course, a standard Western narrative device, but director Gavin O'Connor repeatedly defuses tension by cutting away to convoluted flashbacks revealing the characters' emotionally tangled backstories.</Review>

            <Review>What it does do - is allow you to park your brain in neutral for 100 minutes, laugh at some silly jokes... and then walk out of theatre and immediately forget it ever happened. And there's nothing wrong with that. In fact, it's kind of refreshing.</Review>
            <Review>Ride Along 2, which picks up not long after the first film ended, doesn't mess much with the formula, except that everything feels more frayed and tired this time around.</Review>
            <Review>Hart and Cube are too good to settle for hawking leftovers. They deserve better. So do we.</Review>
            <Review>Ride Along 2 - everything one would expect and less - is over-the-top imbecilic.</Review>
            <Review>"Ride Along" was a surprise hit, earning $135 million and becoming Ice Cube and Kevin Hart's biggest starring vehicle. "Ride Along 2" is essentially more of the same, and Hart is its driving force. Ride with it.</Review>
            <Review>Ride Along 2 - propelled by an unintelligent, predictable story line and enough gunplay and explosions to eradicate a small nation - is good for a few belly laughs. But not much more.</Review>
            <Review>Ride Along 2 stretches the premise of the original paper-thin ... The unlikely glee of the original is thoroughly gone this time around.</Review>
            <Review>There are only so many bad things you can say about a film that left you genuinely bored and watching the clock, but there really isn't a redeeming feature and all I can say is, you'd be better off giving this one a miss.</Review>
            <Review>A wholly generic and predictable cop movie, not just in its plot but down to the tiniest details of its aesthetic.</Review>
            <Review>About as much fun as a parking ticket.</Review>
            <Review>Unfortunately, thanks to a lazy and often absurd script - an angry alligator also makes an appearance at one point - whatever vision birthed this sequel just doesn't add up.</Review>

            <Review>The fact we care at all about the outcome is a testament to the actors, and only the actors. But buried beneath the Christmas clutter is a much better movie.</Review>
            <Review>It has enough personality and ambition that it could easily become an annual tradition for those who prefer "Silent Night, Deadly Night" to "It's a Wonderful Life."</Review>
            <Review>Although there are some amusing moments here and there and a couple of nicely effective scary bits, it is never quite as darkly funny nor as frightening as it would like to be ...</Review>
            <Review>The movie sends mixed messages. It's hard, but gooey, too. Trick 'r Treat showed that Dougherty has a mean streak (with wit), but with Krampus, he's clearly been charged with delivering a wide-appeal PG-13 film.</Review>
            <Review>Too many obnoxious relatives, evil critters and weak gags at the expense of fat kids and foul-mouthed old ladies.</Review>
            <Review>Lurches between treacle and terror as it stumbles toward a too-easy ending.</Review>
            <Review>The narrow population of people who sincerely like the holidays but also enjoy making fun of them, and responds well to movie monsters has a new piece of essential seasonal viewing.</Review>
            <Review>For an example of how not to blend genres, look to Krampus, which fuses horror, comedy and the Christmas feelgood movie into one lumpy festive package.</Review>
            <Review>A woefully misguided horror effort...</Review>
            <Review>Conjuring up the tongue-in-cheek malevolence of Gremlins, family horror-comedy Krampus unleashes a cloven-hoofed monster and his evil minions upon a squabbling American family.</Review>
            <Review>I loved how director Dougherty played with conventions and inherent lunacy of Christmas.</Review>

            <Review>The movie is fluid, suspenseful, and preposterous-although, more historically than psychologically, and not necessarily in a negative sense.</Review>
            <Review>Both a powerful allegory for post-war regeneration and a rich Hitchcockian tale of mistaken identity.</Review>
            <Review>Life is a bombed-out, soulless cabaret in Christian Petzold's Phoenix, a haunting portrait of identity, loss and the search for answers in post-WWII Berlin.</Review>
            <Review>Sometimes implausible and always engrossing, "Phoenix" takes us to postwar Berlin, a shell of a city where concentration camp survivor Nelly is a shell of herself.</Review>
            <Review>You may not buy all the story twists, but perhaps the script is not meant to be taken literally.</Review>
            <Review>There is intrigue. There is suspense. Guilt -- a man's guilt, a nation's -- hangs heavy in the air.</Review>
            <Review>Nina Hoss's performance is one of the shining highlights of the movie year.</Review>
            <Review>There is no need to mince words here-Phoenix is an absolutely terrific film.</Review>
            <Review>Hungary's Son of Saul may have won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, but another World War II drama, Germany's Phoenix, is actually the superior picture.</Review>
            <Review>a shrewd, engaging play of psychological dexterity that, despite its melodramatic roots, never feels arch or forced</Review>
            <Review>An authentic melodrama, carefully employing history, genre and beloved filmic precedents to generate large, complicated, unsettling emotions.</Review>
            <Review>Phoenix, Christian Petzold's meditation on individual and cinematic ouroboros, lands on Blu-ray with a masterful transfer from the Criterion Collection.</Review>

            <Review>More spellbinding than satisfying, but memorable and even haunting all the same.</Review>
            <Review>Tale of Tales is the most faithful and creatively rendered fairy tale onscreen to date, bizarrely satisfying and totally worth a patient, focused viewing.</Review>
            <Review>The director invests his filmmaking with so much bawdy, darkly comic energy that it's all the more perplexing that "Tale of Tales" never quite stirs to life.</Review>

            <Review>A series of comparatively pat resolutions and an abrupt conclusion prevent this from emerging as one of the year's best pictures -- even so, there's still much to recommend.</Review>

            <Review>For the tots, the film is blandly inoffensive enough to offer some Saturday afternoon entertainment, but this isn't one of those crossover hits that parents can enjoy just as much as their kids.</Review>
            <Review>Neither its animation nor voice performances are particularly memorable, but Norm of the North, especially in its early section set in the Arctic, has its appealing moments.</Review>
            <Review>It's got elements of Happy Feet, Madagascar, Despicable Me, Ice Age, and any number of other films. But most of these elements go nowhere.</Review>
            <Review>Think of every trope associated with animated family movies and you'll find them all in Norm of the North, a thoroughly uninspired story of a polar bear attempting to save his habitat from a hypocritical hippie seeking to develop condos in the Arctic.</Review>
            <Review>The animation already looks dated, and it feels as lazy as the bland narrative, which finds Norm traveling to New York City to try stop construction on his home.</Review>
            <Review>A bland, nearly incompetent animated movie that assumes kids can only be entertained by the sights of a dancing polar bear, of "cute and marketable" lemmings (the movie's own description) urinating in an aquarium, and of a bird defecating on people.</Review>
            <Review>With its strangely adult plot about global warming and real estate development and its mediocre animation style, Norm of the North is one to skip.</Review>
            <Review>Norm of the North is nothing but wasted potential.</Review>
            <Review>When stacked up against the Disneys, Pixars and Illuminations of the world, this comparatively modest, lower-tier family film hailing from Lionsgate is middling and kind of lame.</Review>
            <Review>All in all, Norm of the North is one big ball of mess. Uninvolving, unfunny and visually inferior to its peers, this is a straight-to-DVD production at best. How it managed to sneak its way onto the big-screen, we will never know.</Review>
            <Review>In spite of the positive message on the preservation of the wild, the film falls short in the supposedly comedically inclined moments.</Review>
            <Review>Norm of the North is a rancid excursion into well-intentioned animated chaos that proves to be an excruciating endurance test no one of sound mind or body should ever attempt to watch, and that includes their children.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>I√±√°rritu has constructed an epic fable of uncommon grace and resonance--a film that, like its hero, achieves a kind of transcendence.</Review>
            <Review>The journey is long and painstaking, the better to give you a sense of just what is being opposed to what.</Review>
            <Review>DiCaprio is called on to depict the man's desperation, grief and searing anger almost entirely through his eyes and he does it with remarkable depth, turning Glass's endurance into a steadfastness both physical and emotional.</Review>
            <Review>DiCaprio may get put through bloody hell, but on a big screen "The Revenant" is heaven, with Lubezki's camera painting the American West as a rapturous primeval proving ground.</Review>
            <Review>There is so much to like and admire and study closely, including DiCaprio's mature, committed, ruthless and yet empathetic performance.</Review>
            <Review>The enormously talented Alejandro G. I√±√°rritu ("Amores Perros," "21 Grams," "Birdman") strikes again with this 19th century American fable, one of the most brutally beautiful movies I've ever seen.</Review>
            <Review>The Revenant is a harsh, outrageous and significant film. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>The Revenant is epic, atmospheric and visceral. It is also a great old-fashioned yarn.</Review>
            <Review>The Revenant is a muddled and lumpy affair, one whose occasionally brilliant flourishes are buried in an overlong movie in love with its own sense of grandiose suffering.</Review>
            <Review>It's a wallop of spectacle and soul-searching that director Alejandro G I√±√°rritu serves up in his follow-up to last year's Birdman - a revenge-propelled must-see epic, master-crafted to leave you breathless.</Review>
            <Review>As an experience, it's thrilling, terrifying and sobering. But there's nothing to The Revenant except what darkness lies in the hearts of men, and who on the earth needs to know any more about that.</Review>
            <Review>For all that The Revenant is aggressively dour to the point of self-parody, it's exquisitely made.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2015</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>88</Duration>
        <StoryLine>To speak of African cinema is to speak the name of Ousmane Sembene. Known as "the father of African film," this was no easy title to bear, as shown in this personal essay about one of the world's greatest artists. Sembene! takes you from Dakar, Senegal, to the docks of Marseille, France, to New York City. In a career spanning 40 years, Sembene tasted the highs and the lows, only to re-invent himself with a powerful blend of documentary, French New Wave, and Realism, creating films that shocked the sociopolitical power structures of the day. Classics like Xala, Black Girl, and Moolaade established his cinematic vision and made him an international emissary who presented the inner lives of his people on film. Told by those who knew him best and with fascinating archival interviews, Sembene! constructs a revealing portrait of a curious, cantankerous, and deeply intellectual artist. Sembene promoted a new vision of Africa, and his films injected that vision into the world. Sembene! is a testament to the power of story, highlighting how it can plant a seed of thought that crosses generations.</StoryLine>

            <Review>A richly crafted documentary that serves as an enlightening tribute to the filmmaker who masterfully tapped into the medium's wide-reaching socio-political potential.</Review>
            <Review>For a filmmaker who believed in giving Africans their own voice, it seems appropriate to offer such an unvarnished portrait.</Review>
            <Review>Each time we see an image of Sembene with a camera in this documentary, it still feels like a revolutionary statement.</Review>
            <Review>Mr. Semb√®ne was an inspiration; as a film, "Semb√®ne!" is something less than that, petering out as it goes on, but at least offering a fair-minded tribute to a master.</Review>
            <Review>The remarkable career of Senegalese filmmaker Sembene Ousmane gets an appropriate overview in this intelligent, slightly dry doc.</Review>
            <Review>Sembene emerges here as a courageous man dedicated above all else to his art and the vision he felt compelled to express.</Review>
            <Review>...honors the Senegalese novelist and director Ousmane Sembene, who is often called the father of African cinema,</Review>
            <Review>A rich, engaging portrait not only of Africa's great filmmaker, but also of the course (and necessity) of influence, including co-filmmaker Gadjigo's journey while discovering more about the life and work of his late friend.</Review>
            <Review>Sembene! finds its own rhythm: part-retrospective, part-academic study in the spirit of the director's work.</Review>
            <Review>Sembene! should be a major step in drawing attention back to a titan of world cinema, whose influence was never contained by the frame, or the screen.</Review>
            <Review>Conventional bio-doc enlivened by personal perspectives and impressive array of footage, photos, archival and intimates' interviews, and film clips. . .Leaves out mentors.</Review>

        <Duration>98</Duration>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>What makes Drunk Stoned Brilliant Dead feel particularly vibrant is how the Lampoon's specific art direction is put to use.</Review>
            <Review>If you think there is nothing funnier than putting a sacred cow in a blender and hitting the pur√©e button, this is the movie for you.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is an orgy of boomer self-congratulation -- yet it lacks even that movie's ironic notation of how a bastion of white-male privilege managed to pass itself off as radical.</Review>
            <Review>Tirola's documentary is brisk and entertaining, if not especially thoughtful. But then neither was the magazine, whose militant bad taste spawned "Saturday Night Live" and so much more.</Review>
            <Review>We can only imagine with glee what these comic geniuses could have done with some of today's political and cultural figures.</Review>
            <Review>A frenetic, rough-edged, unapologetic tribute to the Lampoon, featuring some amazing archival footage, nifty bits of animation and dozens of straightforward talking-head interviews that crackle and pop.</Review>
            <Review>This is a celebration, not an examination, and those looking for a critique of the ribald publication, radio show, off-Broadway play, and film franchise [should go] elsewhere.</Review>
            <Review>Drunk Stoned Brilliant did convince me that the Lampoon has a colorful, even important, journalistic history, and that some extraordinary talents were involved, however often they were drugged out.</Review>
            <Review>Director Douglas Tirola makes the anarchic but nonetheless productive rise of what would become a multimedia franchise great fun.</Review>
            <Review>With this sensitive yet playful voice, Tirola shows how decades of richly comedic material found its cultural maturity.</Review>
            <Review>A fluke phenomenon like this couldn't happen now, but we should be grateful it ever happened at all.</Review>
            <Review>The film understandably assumes that everyone who had anything to do with National Lampoon was a comic genius, but that's simply not the case.</Review>

            <Review>Stuffed with examples of the nose-thumbing spirit that has sustained their popularity despite the bandmates' refusal to reveal their individual identities, the film is a fine primer for the curious.</Review>
            <Review>We hear statements of admiration for the band from such longtime fans as Penn Jillette (of Penn &amp; Teller) and "The Simpsons" creator Matt Groening. But there is precious little context or critical thinking to make one truly care.</Review>
            <Review>The film is a must-see for those who want to be introduced to the band, even if part way through you may find that you've hit your limit.</Review>
            <Review>There's plenty of eye and ear-catching stimulation in this survey of the Residents' 40-year career.</Review>
            <Review>The task of parsing the meaning behind all their conceptual madness is left to a small but faithful army of fans, who speak lovingly of the band's devotion to art at the expense of commercial success.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>Less offensively nationalistic than the second installment but falling short of the glowing humanity, genial Cantonese humor and visual flair of the first, the pic is somewhat tarnished by its pedestrian plot and limp characterization.</Review>
            <Review>Yen is appealing, the story moves right along, and the martial arts sequences are (to my untrained eye) impressive. In short, a good enough conclusion to the Ip Man saga.</Review>
            <Review>"Ip Man 3" is pretty much what you'd expect, but there's something extra special about an action movie that ends not on a moment of triumph but one of introspection.</Review>
            <Review>The plot of the film is pretty silly, but it functions largely as a fight-delivery system, and on that level it's relatively successful.</Review>
            <Review>Early in "Ip Man 3," Yip is visited by a young Bruce Lee, and Yip decides he's not ready for training. But if it led to an "Ip Man 4," who'd complain?</Review>
            <Review>The only real spark in the film is provided by Yen's costar Zhang Jin as Cheung Tin-chi, an upstart devotee of the wing chun school intent on knocking Ip off his hallowed throne atop Hong Kong's martial-arts pantheon.</Review>
            <Review>... a handsome production and busy film with plenty of activity around a simple plot that stitches together familiar martial arts movie clich√©s.</Review>
            <Review>'Why am I crying at the awesomeness of this fight?' Because it's art. Martial arts produce the same response as that 'Marriage of Figaro' aria in 'The Shawshank Redemption.'</Review>
            <Review>This swinging between extreme silliness and the poker-faced hero worship of Ip Man the character makes this more an exercise in pastiche than a movie.</Review>
            <Review>A respectable action drama that doesn't try to replicate the pleasure of its predecessors, instead admirably turning to contemplate Ip's priorities in life.</Review>
            <Review>It's kind of a shame that this series feels so determined to stick to the facts of real-life kung fu grandmaster Ip Man (Donnie Yen), because it's a lot more fun when it's a good old-fashioned martial-arts free-for-all.</Review>
            <Review>It's inevitable that everyone will Wing Chun tonight, and when they do, you actually give a damn what they're fighting for.</Review>

            <Review>Predictable but unexpectedly enlightened.</Review>
            <Review>The movie's mean-spiritedness becomes even more painful than the dippiness of the source material.</Review>
            <Review>Wayans is ... incapable of limiting himself to parodying one movie at a time, tossing in riffs on Whiplash, Magic Mike, and Zero Dark Thirty to varying degrees of success.</Review>
            <Review>As with other staples of the screen-parody genre, the comic bull's-eyes arrive only intermittently.</Review>
            <Review>Wayans continues his pattern of creating movie simulacra - calling them "parodies" or even "spoofs" puts far too fine a point on it - whereby we're supposed to laugh because we recognize the thing that is being reenacted.</Review>
            <Review>As a piece of cultural criticism, however, it painstakingly eviscerates nearly every scene in "Grey" and skewers latent sexism, classism and ludicrous sexual innuendoes, as well as the original's numerous plot holes.</Review>
            <Review>The message remains, ultimately, one of female empowerment ... but here it's presented through an endless blizzard of latex genitalia, racial epithets and bodily fluids.</Review>
            <Review>There are undoubtedly four or five one-liners that will have you in stitches, but given the scattergun approach to jokes, that makes for a rather minuscule percentage.</Review>
            <Review>Another depressing "cinema parody" that isn't half as amusing as the film(s) it wants us to laugh at.</Review>
            <Review>50 Shades of Black does, at least, have to good grace to be 50 times more entertaining than the original.</Review>
            <Review>The laziest visual gags are accompanied by a cavalcade of insensitive, vulgar jokes that never work no matter how many silly faces are pulled.</Review>
            <Review>Woefully uninspired and toxically unfunny, this film is so rotten it could necrotize your soul. Horrible, just horrible.</Review>

            <Review>Trammell carries the film with the physicality of his performance as the jittery, panicked Sonny, exerting a tremendous effort to contain his rising desperation and hysteria.</Review>
            <Review>If there were Oscars for Best Performance in a Movie Academy Voters Wouldn't be Caught Dead Watching, Trammel's performance would be a lock for a nomination.</Review>
            <Review>Mr. Trammell's drug-induced stammers and tics don't by themselves add up to a compelling portrayal, nor is this drama of the down and out at all gripping.</Review>
            <Review>Unfortunately McCann's eerie atmospherics and masterful weaving of flashback sequences into the narrative can't save the movie from encroaching clich√©.</Review>
            <Review>Even when all the puzzling pieces of Sonny's existence don't quite fit, Trammell's beautifully unhinged performance offers a compelling vision of a grieving narcissist burrowing into the rabbit hole of his own mind.</Review>

            <Review>Partridge portrays David with immaculate timing and meticulous attention to detail. We feel for the character's pain, but never quite trust him.</Review>
            <Review>Partridge has a strong screen presence, but the potential power of his storytelling approach is negated when emotions get mushy in the third act. That's when we figure out that this film doesn't know exactly what it wants to say.</Review>
            <Review>Equally fascinating and frustrating, writer/director/actor Ross Partridge's "Lamb" explores a threatening February and November relationship between odd kindred spirits.</Review>
            <Review>"Lamb" is empathetic and untrustworthy, haunting but often unpersuasive. In the end it's hard to say what the film's point is. But it lingers in the mind.</Review>
            <Review>In the novel, Lamb is a fantasist who uses Tommie as a blank (pure) slate on which to write a new life story. Mr. Partridge never figures out how to complicate his version and its voices, or maybe doesn't want to.</Review>
            <Review>Feeling creeped out is unavoidable, but it's an inquisitive unsettling born of a faith that people are inherently complicated, worthy of love, capable of good and yet all too often mired in well-meaning intentions that hurt more than help.</Review>
            <Review>Ross Partridge's unsettling drama Lamb, based on Bonnie Nadzam's novel, leaves this agonizing question to linger over the action for most of the way, which isn't quite as cruel a proposition as it seems.</Review>
            <Review>It is at once earnest, sinister, tender and impossible to figure out.</Review>
            <Review>Lamb clearly wants to make a thoughtful exploration of two lost people, yet the intentions get waylaid by the sheer weirdness of the situation.</Review>
            <Review>The film's more difficult trick is to make us care for Lamb even as we recoil at how he near he gets to a moral precipice. The friendship between the two characters may be wildly inappropriate, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have value to them.</Review>
            <Review>It's a beautifully shot film, and Oona Laurence evokes 1970s Jodie Foster, which is appropriate considering that it's exactly the kind of role Foster would have crushed back in the day. Hopefully, Laurence will turn out as well.</Review>
            <Review>Ross Partridge directed, wrote the screenplay (from a novel by Bonnie Nadzam) and delivers the strong central performance. He keeps us on edge in all three capacities ...</Review>

            <Review>Some handsome location shooting in New Orleans doesn't make up for the Oscar winners' relentless hamming and a plot that twists way beyond credibility.</Review>
            <Review>Such a ragged and desultory muddle is "Misconduct."</Review>
            <Review>Why on earth is Anthony Hopkins involved in this? Or Al Pacino?</Review>
            <Review>Except for Mr. Hopkins and Mr. Pacino, going through their familiar paces, incompetent is the word.</Review>
            <Review>A derivative but diverting thriller featuring relatively subdued turns by Anthony Hopkins and Al Pacino.</Review>
            <Review>A disaster of Room-sized proportions.</Review>
            <Review>An overcomplicated potboiler that's so bad it's almost good.</Review>
            <Review>It's so hilariously inept that it's almost worth watching.</Review>
            <Review>The plot is gossamer thin, the twist would take a two-year-old about as many seconds to see coming and it's a miracle there is any scenery left by the time Pacino and Hopkins were done.</Review>
            <Review>It's with strange awe that you realise, halfway through the legal thriller Misconduct, that it may actually be the worst film either Anthony Hopkins or Al Pacino have ever starred in.</Review>
            <Review>It shamelessly cribs from 90s potboilers (a last-minute twist is stolen from a notable film of the decade) and Pacino is hammier than a hog roast, but it's too lurid to be dull.</Review>

Speaking no Spanish and lost in her foreign "homeland," she reluctantly takes refuge at her estranged father's cattle ranch. As she clashes with her unyielding father, her attempts to return home to the U.S. thrust her into a dangerous bond with a foreign smuggler, Ricky. Caught between her father's sermons, Ricky's promises, and the encroaching military, Claudia must navigate a tightrope of impossible choices.

            <Review>Co-directors Dwyer and Kaitlin McLaughlin prove more adept at the first act's low-key character building than the action-movie showdowns they're building toward, but Claudia's use of a makeshift flamethrower late in the game is an unexpected joy.</Review>
            <Review>McLaughlin, for whom this is her first feature-length screenwriting credit, gives her characters incisive dialogue that keeps the human relations front and center. She also knows the value of silence and its ability to convey fear, dread and loneliness.</Review>
            <Review>It's the sort of movie that has a sense of authenticity to it, even if the circumstances themselves are tremendously dramatic. It's a strong, solid debut from Dwyer, and will hopefully serve as a calling card for him and his talented cast.</Review>

            <Review>[The two leads'] heartbreaking performances imbue this familiar Austin-set narrative with a fiery edge.</Review>
            <Review>Hannah Fidell has quickly become one of the faces to watch in independent film, her naturalistic style of filmmaking and ability to get the best of our her actors and shepherd improvised scenes creates characters and movies you want to root for.</Review>
            <Review>The euphoria and anguish of first love has been captured in countless films, but few do it with the level of raw authenticity and intimacy as 6 Years.</Review>
            <Review>It gives shape to the anxiety and emotional tumult that comes with maturation and the struggle to hold a relationship together after irreparable fissures have already started to form.</Review>
            <Review>Indie romance has domestic violence, lots of sex, drinking.</Review>
            <Review>...a film worth watching, one that depicts young love in all its toxic and swooning glory.</Review>
            <Review>6 Years has universal appeal in spades, two lovely lead performances and a whole lot of truth.</Review>
            <Review>Next time out, Fidell needs to find some kind of midrange between A Teacher's outr√© leanings and 6 Years' conventionality.</Review>
            <Review>There is enough in 6 Years from Farmiga and Rosenfield's performances to warrant a watch, and Fidell's ideas and subtle developments around such a challenging story are heartfelt and mostly well-rendered.</Review>

            <Review>Raw, funny and incredibly moving.</Review>
            <Review>The story isn't particularly original, but Mustang's achievement is to criticize a society that sexualizes everything women do while still celebrating the girls' sexuality.</Review>
            <Review>Erg√ºven isn't peddling blind optimism so much as a realism animated by the belief that freedom-far from being inevitable-must be fought for. That it will be fought for.</Review>
            <Review>That there are five sisters allows Erguven to explore the scenario's several possible outcomes, be it happy ending or tragedy or the bittersweet fates in between.</Review>
            <Review>Erg√ºven's film, beautifully shot and beautifully performed, cuts its storybook tone with starker, more brutal truths.</Review>
            <Review>Part of a welcome international wave of films made by women directors that focus on girls growing up in worlds of men - and on what they look like when no one's looking.</Review>
            <Review>Mustang is a strikingly original, if disturbing film, which certainly deserves to be seen by us all.</Review>
            <Review>There's nothing surprising in the film's aesthetic, but it's executed with admirable skill and vitality.</Review>
            <Review>While a highly realistic film because of its naturalistic actors, it's equally stylised by providing space for the actors through formal decisions that amplify their emotions.</Review>
            <Review>Mustang is astonishing; staying with you long after viewing.</Review>
            <Review>Very solid and well-constructed film that is eye-opening without being heavy-handed.</Review>

            <Review>It keeps you tensed and anxious and never sure of how anything will turn out. You get your money's worth.</Review>
            <Review>To give credit where it's due, this lukewarm mess of a movie delivers what its title promises.</Review>
            <Review>This overly talky, slackly executed game of cat-and-mouse comes off as cheesy rather than chilling.</Review>
            <Review>Big-budget action epics might be the current norm, but there's something to be said for the slow burn. Enter Standoff, which delivers pretty much what its title advertises.</Review>
            <Review>It's both cleverly written and directed.</Review>
            <Review>The concept might have worked better as a short, where the bookend action sequences would have had more impact and the extended middle stretch wouldn't have included so many silly twists and misguided stabs at moral complexity.</Review>
            <Review>Thomas Jane and Laurence Fishburne in a very different sort of faceoff, of post-military conflict damaged souls in this PTSD psychological crime thriller. As one struggles against his inner demons, and the other succumbs to the mental ravages of war.</Review>
            <Review>Histrionics aside, Standoff still has a lot to offer, with Thomas Jane giving a grounded performance to clash with Laurence Fishburne's own over the top one.</Review>
            <Review>A shoot 'em up with surprises and style to spare.</Review>
            <Review>What should be a simple genre piece is overly complicated by the unfocused ambitions of its director.</Review>
            <Review>Plays like the faintest copy of a copy of countless superior films.</Review>
            <Review>Perhaps the feature isn't dramatically explosive or inventive, but Alleca keeps it lean and captivating, giving "Standoff" an enjoyable energy with healthy bursts of action and antagonism.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2016</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>84</Duration>
        <StoryLine>HAVANA MOTOR CLUB tells a personal, character-driven story about Cuba's vibrant community of underground drag racers and their quest to hold Cuba's first official car race since shortly after the 1959 Revolution. It tackles how Cuba's recent reforms - the owning of property, allowance of small businesses, and greater exchange between Cubans, Cuban Americans, tourists, and other foreigners - have affected the lives of these racers and their families. One racer enlists the help of a Cuban American patron in Miami to bring in parts for his modern Porsche. His main competitor is a renowned mechanic who uses ingenuity rather than resources to create a racing machine out of his father's 1955 Chevy Bel Air. Another racer ponders whether he will participate in the race or sell his motor - one that he recovered on the ocean floor from a ship used to smuggle Cubans off the island - in order to flee Cuba on a raft headed to Florida. Meanwhile, the race itself is in jeopardy of coming to fruition due to factors ranging from its status as an elitist sport to the arrival of the Pope in Cuba. Through the experiences of these racers and their community, HAVANA MOTOR CLUB explores how Cuba is changing today and what its future holds in light of the Obama Administration's recent move to normalize relations with the island nation.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Flanagan's taut direction reinforces his rep as an up-and-comer we will hopefully be hearing much more from.</Review>
            <Review>Silence is golden in "Hush," one of the more inspired concoctions to emerge from the busy Blumhouse horror-thriller assembly line in recent years.</Review>
            <Review>So tense and involving as to make everyone watching a flinching, wincing, cheering participant, "Hush" ought to join the best works of Hitchcock, Carpenter and De Palma as a future teaching tool in genre film courses. This is how it's done.</Review>
            <Review>Bolstered by intelligent characters and a nail-biting premise, Hush is easily one of the most striking scary stories 2016 has to offer.</Review>
            <Review>Hush doesn't just upend horror tropes. He makes us wonder why we liked them in the first place.</Review>
            <Review>It's a sharp, finely tuned thriller that goes down familiar paths but with flair and skill. Flanagan doesn't hold back on the gore, but he doesn't rely on it.</Review>
            <Review>Mike Flanagan has a knack for making the most out of smaller-scale stories, and Hush is no different.</Review>
            <Review>A fast-paced, impressively efficient, and wildly suspenseful cat &amp; mouse thriller.</Review>
            <Review>Mike Flanagan, following up his excellent Oculus, does a superb job of employing a rather familiar premise as a springboard for a tense and creepy little chiller.</Review>
            <Review>An allegory for how isolation could be the downfall of humanity wrapped up in a smart and effectively scary home invasion story, Hush really impressed and left me with an even deeper appreciation for Flanagan's approach as a visual storyteller.</Review>
            <Review>Hush has a solid first half before the cat-and-mouse shenanigans begin to seem repetitive and prolonged. Still, at 82 minutes Hush is a concise and well-executed horror nightmare.</Review>
            <Review>It's a game of cat and mouse, but while it proceeds as expected in the grand scheme - killer stalking a victim who tries to stay a step ahead - the thrills are in the details.</Review>

            <Review>If you were at a creepy dinner party, and the hosts decided to show a video of their vacation in which they spent time with a crazy cult leader in Mexico, would you stick around for the main course?</Review>
            <Review>Psychological thrillers just don't get any better than this.</Review>
            <Review>Beautifully paced, the movie traces a steady arc from amiability to apocalypse.</Review>
            <Review>John Carroll Lynch shares credit with a superb ensemble, but it's his halcyon turn as a pitiable demon that unifies the action.</Review>
            <Review>All this foreboding produces no suspense: It's evident from the bloody prologue where "The Invitation" is headed.</Review>
            <Review>Will is the proxy through which we experience the increasingly confounding web of suspicion and surprises that are obfuscated by social niceties and facades of politesse.</Review>
            <Review>A must-see psychological thriller.</Review>
            <Review>Is this a film about grief masquerading as a horror film -- or vice versa?</Review>
            <Review>A must see picture.</Review>
            <Review>An emotional rollercoaster. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>I'm glad I knew almost nothing going in, so I won't say much more, except that the masterful slow burn is its own payoff</Review>
            <Review>Fans of the horror movie genre might be able to pick up on what's going on, but not without a lot of fight and sway by "The Invitation".</Review>
