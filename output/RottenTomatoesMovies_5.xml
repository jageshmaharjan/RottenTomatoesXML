            <Review>The basic story's narrative and psychological simplicity - characters stating their beliefs over and over again - becomes an increasing burden.</Review>
            <Review>A substandard "crime drama" that reeks of the Idiot Plot Syndrome.</Review>
            <Review>"After the Fall" belongs to a type of movie that is too lazy to connect the dots and fill in the blanks between its supposedly teachable moments.</Review>
            <Review>If you can avoid dwelling on its derivative qualities, "After the Fall" has its own case to make about how far the middle class has fallen - and continues to slide.</Review>
            <Review>[The film] has much to recommend, including gorgeous New Mexico landscapes, sumptuous digital cinematography and -- as we might expect from Klein -- virtuoso editing.</Review>
            <Review>Scanlon's desperate dive into a life of armed robbery is simply not believable, despite Bentley's best efforts.</Review>
            <Review>There are hints along the way of the socioeconomic strife that Klein wants to explore, yet they become lost in a muddled screenplay that doesn't establish sympathy for its protagonist or his plight.</Review>
            <Review>Forgettable...Bentley is bland, first scene to last, and thanks to its subject, the film is instantly dated</Review>
            <Review>Fall isn't going to cure the world's ills, but it does define a few of them to satisfaction, creating an engrossing journey into extremity without ringing all the obvious bells on the way down.</Review>
            <Review>A film that could only succeed by sorting through gradually darkening shades of gray works exclusively in embarrassingly bold strokes.</Review>
            <Review>Moral ambiguity is center stage, and the film ultimately succeeds by sending audiences home to ponder their own levels of sin.</Review>
            <Review>Beautifully shot but disappointingly slack, Things People Do is ultimately as dull and forgettable as its title.</Review>

            <Review>Brotherhood Of Blades is a gripping, entertaining martial arts drama in which the cut-and-thrust of the narrative is as important as the swordplay action.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>80</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Director Christina Voros and producer James Franco pull back the curtain on the fetish empire of Kink.com, the Internet's largest producer of BDSM content. In a particularly obscure corner of an industry that operates largely out of public view, Kink.com's directors and models strive for authenticity. In an enterprise often known for exploitative practices, Kink.com upholds an ironclad set of values to foster an environment that is safe, sane, and consensual. They aim to demystify the BDSM lifestyle, and to serve as an example and an educational resource for the BDSM community. In kink, we discover not only a fascinating and often misunderstood subculture, but also, in a career far from the mainstream, a group of intelligent, charismatic, and driven people who really, truly love what they do.</StoryLine>

            <Review>The doc is often terrific fun. But it is a work of observation and advocacy rather than journalism.</Review>
            <Review>It's not all about catharsis and transcendence for these folks; sometimes it's just about providing sordid sexual fantasies to people who need them.</Review>
            <Review>Kink may ultimately be too slight to rank as a great documentary, but it does suggest the arrival of a great documentary filmmaker.</Review>
            <Review>More than just a thorough examination of hardcore pornography, Christina Voros's doc is also a sort of chronicle of the filmmaking process.</Review>
            <Review>kink wonderfully achieves its goal of lightly educating and demystifying the world of BDSM, but for people that are already familiar with this world, you may find yourself left wanting.</Review>

            <Review>A deeply cynical movie masquerading as a complex moral dilemma, the Australian drama "Felony" proves only that skilled actors and slick photography can tart up even the most problematic script.</Review>
            <Review>Starring a trio of top male actors in splendid roles, the intricate, intimate "Felony" is a police story crossed with a perceptive psychological drama.</Review>
            <Review>It's a rare treat to see a suspenseful crime drama delivered with so much nuance and restraint.</Review>
            <Review>There's nothing glamorous about Felony's depiction of police work. These are stressed-out cops, flailing under pressure.</Review>
            <Review>Strong acting all 'round helps, but unfortunately this is just a slow ride to nowhere.</Review>
            <Review>A lifeless Australian morality play about three corrupt police officers who cover up a hit-and-run.</Review>
            <Review>It's unfortunately weighted down by a plodding pace and a depressing, dull narrative that reveals nothing about the characters or human morality.</Review>
            <Review>It's potentially juicy morality-play material, but Edgerton's script does nothing novel with it, so that most of Felony is a long, drawn-out slog</Review>
            <Review>It's an impressive piece of writing, keeping one hand on formula while the other searches for the truth of the moment, finding all sorts of unseemly and desperate behavior to dissect.</Review>
            <Review>It's Wilkinson who's the true standout as a boozy, belligerent, woefully compromised soul.</Review>
            <Review>Not even the always dynamic Tom Wilkinson ... can save Felony from Edgerton's preachy screenplay and a performance that lacks personality and a clear point of view.</Review>
            <Review>It reveals itself to be a profoundly cynical movie posing as a work of idealism, and it's all the more insidious because it's otherwise so bland and forgettable.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>138</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Southern Baptist Sissies is a film of the theatrical experience of writer/director Del Shores' GLAAD Award-winning play about four gay boys growing up in the Southern Baptist church. It explores the conflict between the caustic rhetoric of dogmatic religion and the fragile development of adolescent homosexuality while challenging hypocrisy, exposing damage and offering hope. The intimate experience of theatre on the film screen reveals the complicated emotions from all sides - the confused child, the struggling adolescent and the angry and damaged adult.

            <Review>Designated for a safe space containing a receptive audience, the play neither provokes nor challenges. It preaches to the choir instead of spreading the word.</Review>
            <Review>The pieces of the play fit together a little too neatly, but "Southern Baptist Sissies" has many powerful displays of heavy emotion, building to a cathartic climax.</Review>
            <Review>To call it stagey is an understatement, since it is simply a filmed version of a performance of (Del Shores') play. As such, it is also overlong at 138 minutes without the benefit of an intermission and comes across as preachy and pedantic.</Review>
            <Review>A filmed staging of Del Shores' provocative stage play, this movie is an engaging exploration of the point where religion and sexuality collide in the American South.</Review>

            <Review>The main question Rosewater grapples with is whether Stewart can hack it as a filmmaker. The answer: sort of?</Review>
            <Review>Rosewater certainly has merit as an act of atonement on Stewart's part and a tribute to people like Bahari... In the end, however, the movie needs to stand on its own, apart from its noble intentions and the popularity of its writer-director.</Review>
            <Review>The hard-focus clarity of the images (Bobby Bukowski did the cinematography) leads to an intimacy with anguish that passes into expressionism.</Review>
            <Review>This is Jon Stewart's directorial debut; the talk show comedian has a handle on the material and conveys it clearly.</Review>
            <Review>Rosewater ... has an urgency that's all about the storytelling smarts of its first-time writer-director.</Review>
            <Review>Stewart does a credible job of maintaining the story's immediacy, but I must say I felt relieved that the film wasn't a masterpiece. If it was, we'd have more reason to fear Stewart will leave The Daily Show.</Review>
            <Review>[Rosewater features] fine playing from Bernal and Bodnia, and striking mixing of real and recreated footage of the riots that transpired after the rigged election.</Review>
            <Review>We rarely get the sense that Stewart is talking down to us - which is why it's such a disappointment that 'Rosewater', is so often pitched and played like a carefully dumbed-down TV movie.</Review>
            <Review>For the most part Rosewater is well-acted, tension-filled and slyly iconoclastic. Say hello to Jon Stewart, movie director.</Review>
            <Review>It's a somewhat bumpy road for the first time filmmaker, but it's surprisingly effective when it needs to be.</Review>
            <Review>Despite a few stylistic flourishes, the production is an earnest and straightforward account of what happened, with moments of naturalistic humor based on some major miscommunication.</Review>
            <Review>Stewart proves himself an adept visual stylist here, using simple techniques such as lighting scenes using the glow of a laptop screen to reflect the darkness that comes from being physically cut off from the people Bahari cares about the most.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>Woodruff's direction is smooth enough on a technical level, but the film's storytelling has little dimension, even for a melodrama.</Review>
            <Review>The actors are uniformly handsome and mostly serviceable, though the same can't be said about the filmmaking or the writing.</Review>
            <Review>Watching "Addicted" is like eating Cheese Whiz straight from the jar. There's no nutritional value. It's kind of embarrassing. But it does satisfy a base craving for cheap, immediate sensation.</Review>
            <Review>The film unfortunately depicts black female sexuality, a topic rarely portrayed onscreen, with all the depth and subtlety of a late night Cinemax offering.</Review>
            <Review>"Addicted" doesn't know whether it wants to be a modern-day bodice-ripper, a morality-tinged cautionary tale or a serious snapshot of sexual compulsion. Whatever the case, it fails on all fronts.</Review>
            <Review>Billed as an erotic thriller but playing more like an R-rated daytime soap, "Addicted" marks a rare but dramatically neutered opportunity to explore a black woman's sexuality onscreen.</Review>
            <Review>Addicted is the kind of film for which the Alan Smithee pseudonym was invented.</Review>
            <Review>Part soapy melodrama, part steamy thriller of infidelity gone sideways, this film is wholly unconvincing as a study of sexual compulsion.</Review>
            <Review>While the leads are certainly attractive enough to bring the book to life, the film fails to live up to the melodrama and seductiveness that made the book popular.</Review>
            <Review>Far be it from me to totally trash a seemingly-silly soap opera males might find laughable to the same extent it moves females to tears. Go figure!</Review>
            <Review>If one squints hard enough, all the nudity and grinding might retain appeal, but for those who can't switch their brain off, the picture is maddeningly inconsistent and comically performed.</Review>
            <Review>Every bit about the dangers of sex addiction as Cheech and Chong movies are about the dangers of pot smoking.</Review>

            <Review>Kill the Messenger does a credible if not dazzling job. In fact, the movie is a lot like the reporting that inspired it: a good introduction to a diabolically tangled tale.</Review>
            <Review>Clichés and obviousness litter the movie.</Review>
            <Review>It's oversold and under-reported. But Kill the Messenger flies high on Jeremy Renner's all-stops-out performance as 1990s-era journalist Gary Webb. Flaws aside, the film inspires a moral outrage that feels disconcertingly timely.</Review>
            <Review>The story of a crusading reporter's determined search for truth, "Kill The Messenger" gains its not-inconsiderable power by not being the kind of movie that particular description might lead you to expect.</Review>
            <Review>A resonant journalistic cautionary tale gets packaged as a hokey thriller in Kill the Messenger, a movie with a message that isn't nearly as urgent as it needs to be.</Review>
            <Review>Drugs, government, truths, mustaches. "Kill the Messenger" is an admirable journalism thriller that takes on a lot of big subjects.</Review>
            <Review>The script by former journalist Peter Landesman, who recently directed the medical drama Concussion, does a good job of simplifying a complex real-life chain of events.</Review>
            <Review>The film doesn't demand that you now respect Webb or sing his praises, but it does ask you to look at the cracks in that tranquil façade, and to keep looking, no matter how much it seems to fracture.</Review>
            <Review>The first half of the movie captivates as it runs through his impressive investigation. But the fallout from Webb's scoop is less enthralling and the story loses traction as it focuses on his crumbling personal life.</Review>
            <Review>The muddled movie contains all the elements of a top-notch muckraker, deployed erratically and to increasingly diminished returns.</Review>
            <Review>It's sporadically gripping but ultimately rather frustrating fare, leaving us intrigued enough by the conspiracy-theory backstory to want hard documentary evidence rather than mere dramatic licence.</Review>
            <Review>Jeremy Renner is on terrific form... but the rest of the movie doesn't quite live up to his impressively nuanced performance.</Review>

            <Review>The setup never really matures beyond a sentimental teenage fantasy with a TV-caliber climax tacked on ...</Review>
            <Review>At its frequent best ... it provides a potent metaphor for a life-changing relationship, cleverly literalizing the way a new romantic connection can feel like a voice in your head that you never want to stop hearing.</Review>
            <Review>It's not a rousing success, but as a lightweight sketch drawn out to uneven feature-length, it manages to deliver a minor entry in the Whedon canon by keeping its most insightful character-driven ingredients intact.</Review>
            <Review>It's the kind of total miscalculation that can only be cooked up by a writer of real skill and passion, going all in on a spectacularly bad idea.</Review>
            <Review>In Your Eyes manages to make a grounded, effective and honestly moving romance out of a premise that on it's face seems self-consciously novel.</Review>
            <Review>[A] disposable but not entirely unlikable confection that feels like a first-timer's passion project and not the work of an A-list writer of Whedon's stature.</Review>
            <Review>A nice first step into Whedon's attempt to site his big-budget fantastical ideas into a smaller, more personal film.</Review>
            <Review>It feels more like Nicholas Sparks than Joss Whedon.</Review>
            <Review>For those unshackled by brittle cynicism and willing to play in an imaginary realm far cuter than anything Joss Whedon has come up with before, then In Your Eyes will be a warmhearted delight.</Review>
            <Review>Whedon is beloved for his work in genre film and television ("Buffy the Vampire Slayer"), but he excels here with a more intimate story.</Review>
            <Review>Think of it as a rom-com version of The Shining, or Nicholas Sparks on a macro-budget.</Review>
            <Review>It's a bit padded, and the ending is trite, but In Your Eyes is a sweetly realized and moving fantasy romance.</Review>

        <Duration>75</Duration>
        <StoryLine>This feature-length animated cartoon was based on the "Peanuts" characters created by comic-strip artist Charles M. Schultz. The gang is shipped off to summer camp, where Charlie Brown gets a "Go away and leave me alone" bunkmate, and where CB's beagle Snoopy ends up winning most of the athletic trophies. The Snoop also has a running feud with a mean-spirited pussycat. Meanwhile, budding feminist Lucy organizes an anti-boy campaign amongst the girl campers. The bulk of the action transpires when the gang builds a raft to enter a dangerous shoot-the-rapids race, only to be outclassed by the professionally built vessel picked up by their competitors. Happily, pluck and luck wins out over arrogance and mean-spiritedness.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Like the source material, this is one terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day that families just might find themselves revisiting often.</Review>
            <Review>It's funny, fast, and charming.</Review>
            <Review>Arteta keeps the action speeding along while eliciting spot-on performances. Carell is at his discombobulated best, and Garner anchors the proceedings with aplomb.</Review>
            <Review>There are a couple of scenes that fall flat, losing the manic push of the rest of the story, but the mood is so screwball that the film hurtles past its own mistakes. It's good fun.</Review>
            <Review>This is where the comedy comes from: that lurking fear that even the most routine of daily domestic tasks is just a spilled coffee cup away from disaster.</Review>
            <Review>"Alexander" won't change your day, but it's not terrible, horrible, no good or very bad, either.</Review>
            <Review>It's the rare, current kid movie made with real actors. Unfortunately, it's not remotely adult-funny. That's OK. Parents suffer. It's what they do. Go and suffer for the kids.</Review>
            <Review>And while the problems had are sadly very white and upper class ones, the message is still relevant. It's also rather funny-at times.</Review>
            <Review>The film may be a good way to distract kids for an hour and 20 minutes, but are any of its messages appropriate?</Review>
            <Review>I found it genuinely adorable and entertaining.</Review>
            <Review>Alexander... etc. isn't exactly a terrible film, but it was definitely in need of a little retooling so that the events plaguing this family weren't quite so unbelievable, annoying, and on the lower end of the comic scale.</Review>
            <Review>Alexander is funnier than one would expect. In a weird way, it's full of refreshingly cranky, dorky goofing.</Review>

            <Review>A fascinating, visually stunning, emotionally devastating documentary by Thomas Allen Harris.</Review>
            <Review>This is sound-bite cinema, revealing at times, but also frustratingly basic stuff.</Review>
            <Review>With the thousand words vividly painted through each picture, we connect, identify and find solidarity.</Review>
            <Review>Harris indulges in too many personal memoir detours and overdoes the talking heads, but much of the imagery on display is extraordinary.</Review>
            <Review>Though a tad uneven, as a whole the documentary cannily juggles an overview of African-American history in general with the specifics of its photographic representation and talents.</Review>
            <Review>Thomas Allen Harris' lush, lovely, loving Through a Lens Darkly chronicles the role of photography in a 170-year history of the lives of black Americans. A teeming abundance of stirring and often brilliant imagery by African-American artists.</Review>
            <Review>Provocative and mildly engaging. It could have used a better organization of its wealth of facts.</Review>
            <Review>It's all way too much, for in his desire to be comprehensive, Harris plumb forgets that less would have been more.</Review>
            <Review>Perhaps too ambitious in scope, a few truly powerful sequences still manage to elevate this historical overview of African-American photography above its uneven style.</Review>
            <Review>Director Thomas Allen Harris has made an earnest, though often sloppy, documentary on the essential role imagery plays in shaping the narrative of a people.</Review>

        <StoryLine>A teenage boy raised by gorillas in Africa falls for a pretty conservationist following a chance meeting in the jungle, but finds their romance threatened by a menacing Silverback, and a scheming capitalist in search of a new energy source in this animated adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs' classic tale. John Greystoke, Jr. was just a toddler when he accompanied his adventurous mother and father on a journey into Africa in search of a mineral that could revolutionize the energy industry. That trip turns tragic, however, when their helicopter crashes in a race to escape a massive storm, leaving young John the sole survivor. Raised from that day forward by a motherly gorilla named Kala, the boy, now named Tarzan, quickly integrates into the family of primates. But alpha male Silverback Tablat refuses to accept Tarzan's presence, viewing him as a direct threat to the clan. Nearly a decade later, Tarzan encounters beautiful Jane Porter, and begins to long for human contact. When Jane returns to the jungle accompanied by smooth-talking entrepreneur William Clayton a few years later, her relationship with Tarzan is rekindled. But while Clayton has ostensibly come to the jungle to support Jane's conservationist endeavors, he's actually searching for the very same energy source once sought by Tarzan's father, and hopes to turn a tidy profit by exploiting the precious resource. The situation turns critical when Jane recognizes Clayton's true intentions, and the only one who can save her from both the villainous industrialist and the menacing Tablat is the noble Tarzan of the apes. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>Proves that technical knowhow and a reliable old yarn will only get you so far when imagination is lacking.</Review>
            <Review>The motion capture feels like a stunt, while the stunts ... don't.</Review>
            <Review>All of this feels awfully simplistic, like a 10-minute cartoon sketch bloated into a full-length movie, and one that's backed by an over-explanatory voiceover that can sometimes sound awkward.</Review>
            <Review>Beautifully animated tale has some violence, intense moments.</Review>
            <Review>The use of motion-capture technology gives the characters very fluid movement and a hyper-realistic quality, but doesn't bring them alive more than traditional CGI animation.</Review>
            <Review>The latest reimagining of a classic text leaves one feeling like a character from Godot -- waiting on a barren stretch of road for something, or someone, to show up and alleviate the never-ending monotony.</Review>
            <Review>The villains are cardboard cutouts, and the good guys aren't much better; wildlife advocate Jane (voiced by Spencer Locke) is a disappointingly passive character.</Review>
            <Review>There is much to admire in "Tarzan," but no lingering emotional through-line to this particular telling.</Review>
            <Review>A perfect mute-button movie, better seen than heard.</Review>
            <Review>Although Reinhard Klooss has the technology to bring this concept to life, the result exposes a level of storytelling short on ideas and inspiration.</Review>
            <Review>Amazingly, amid all the overlayered effects whoopla-hoopla, Tarzan still manages to find sufficient time and space to be very boring.</Review>
            <Review>The human characters all look flat and dead-eyed.</Review>

FAITH CONNECTIONS explores such diverse and deeply moving stories such as those of a young runaway kid, a Sadhu, a mother desperately looking for her lost son, a yogi who is raising an abandoned baby, and an ascetic who keeps his calm by smoking cannabis, all connected by one faith against the spectacular display of devotion.

By day the father scrapes out a meager income as a human billboard for luxury apartments, while his young son and daughter roam the supermarkets and malls surviving off free food samples. Each night the family takes shelter in an abandoned building. The father is strangely affected by a hypnotic mural adorning the wall of this makeshift home. On the day of the father's birthday the family is joined by a woman-might she be the key to unlocking the buried emotions that linger from the past?</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>An adopted 11 year old girl from the suburbs becomes convinced that country singer Dolly Parton is her biological mother, and embarks on an epic quest to seek out her true identity with her adoptive mother in hot pursuit. The year is 1976: Parton is burning up the country music charts, and imaginative pre-teen Elizabeth (Julia Stone) has just discovered that her parents aren't who they seem to be. Determined to get back to her roots, Elizabeth runs away from home, and never looks back. Meanwhile, her adoptive mother (Macha Grenon) realizes she hasn't been doing the confused girl any favors by hiding the truth, and searches desperately for Elizabeth in hopes of getting a second chance to become a real family. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>This winter romance by Rohmer, then in his 70s, demonstrates that faith and art can work miracles.</Review>
            <Review>Rohmer's style, over the years, has become so easy and natural that, at its best, his work never seems like fabricated drama... While this low-budget Tale of Winter may seem simple, it's a masterly simplicity.</Review>
            <Review>As usual, Rohmer works magic with his generally unfamiliar casts, drawing from them more they perhaps realize they're yielding.</Review>
            <Review>Rohmer has become such a master of his chosen classic genre -- the crystalline philosophical tale of character and romantic choice -- that this is a nearly perfect work, in performance as well as execution.</Review>
            <Review>With A Tale of Springtime and A Tale of Winter, Eric Rohmer has given us a pair of wonderful motion pictures... I wonder what Summer and Autumn will bring.</Review>
            <Review>It has, as ever, enormous compassion, wit and insight, and its ending is exquisitely affecting.</Review>
            <Review>A quintessentially Rohmeresque film in that it leaves viewers feeling they have eavesdropped on someone else's life and maybe gleaned a few lessons from the experience.</Review>
            <Review>Eric Rohmer takes an intriguing voyage.</Review>
            <Review>Rarely has this great filmmaker been so successful at blending his most serious concerns with such engaging entertainment.</Review>
            <Review>This witty adult fairy tale, set in the heart of the callous city, is a joy to behold thanks to the naturalism of its performances and the sublime subtlety of its direction.</Review>
            <Review>Eric Rohmer's A Tale of Winter is a beautifully buoyant film, both intellectually challenging and rapturously romantic.</Review>
            <Review>The myriad small joys and failures of everyday life are the director's homeland, piecing together a naturalistic, redemptive and compassionate story.</Review>

When his grandmother dies, he finds out he may be able to take over the lease on her sprawling rent-controlled apartment on Manhattan's posh Upper West Side. The doorman and a lawyer convince him to lock himself in for 12 days, the time it will take to get the lease legally changed to Danny's name. If he leaves the apartment, the landlord will most certainly not let him back in the building; they would go to great lengths to get market-rate tenants in there. Desperate not to return to his dump in Queens, Danny agrees. But once he's locked in, Danny begins to hear strange noises. And unexplainable events start happening in apartment 1003: things he's thrown away reappear, uninvited visitors show up at his door, while welcomed guests vanish unexpectedly. Danny may not be the only OCCUPANT. Perhaps he should have stayed in Queens.</StoryLine>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>It develops into a study of obsession, hypocrisy, righteousness and self-doubt, questioning motive and then gob-smacking the audience with the wholly unexpected.</Review>
            <Review>While initially a gentle interrogation of Christian dogma, The Overnighters expands to a larger investigation of altruism and its roots in private psychologies.</Review>
            <Review>Moss uses images of drill towers or blistering flame as visual metaphors for other things transpiring on screen: the fracturing of a family, the heated fury that comes with a sense of betrayal.</Review>
            <Review>"The Overnighters" is commendable for many reasons, not the least of which is the way it allows complex issues to remain complex. There is a clear conflict between the pastor and the town, but there's no good vs. evil.</Review>
            <Review>So much of "The Overnighters" tells all sorts of truths, and Moss earned the trust of his subjects, whatever they might think of the result.</Review>
            <Review>The movie might seem like just another liberal do-gooder profile, yet a shocker ending throws new and disturbing light on the situation, amplifying the Christian themes at the heart of the story.</Review>
            <Review>It's about humanity: our paranoia, fear, and stubbornness to evolve into a species where peace could ever be a viable reality.</Review>
            <Review>One of the most potent examples of cinéma vérité to arrive in recent years, Jesse Moss's "The Overnighters" transcends the genre with a multifaceted examination of complex social issues facing the town of Williston, North Dakota.</Review>
            <Review>An existentially probing documentary with more layers than a twisty Hollywood thriller, at turns inspiring, challenging, sobering and finally devastating.</Review>
            <Review>Has been described as a 21st-century 'The Grapes of Wrath,' but its plot twists are of the type that might have caused Tom Joad to hightail it back to Oklahoma.</Review>
            <Review>This story, touching many social issues, is told on a very personal level. There is an extraordinary revelation near the end of the film. It is as if it was written by a great screenwriter, but instead, it is real life. Amazing.</Review>
            <Review>In The Overnighters documentarist Jesse Moss found his story and pursued it with remarkable empathy, all in the best traditions of the genre.</Review>

            <Review>Where it scores big is its wealth of ideas-visual, emotional, cultural-and its deep well of bitter, voice-of-experience rage</Review>
            <Review>Even as the jokes cut deep, Dear White People doesn't hesitate to get real.</Review>
            <Review>Screenplay is tight, funny, smart and insightful, and [the] direction has just enough indie feel without becoming too self-conscious or preachy.</Review>
            <Review>The pitch on Dear White People is that it's "Do the Right Thing for the Obama generation," which is both an oversell and a disservice to Justin Simien's witty satire about race relations on a fictional Ivy League campus.</Review>
            <Review>Dear White People offers up some droll and relevant observations on the commodification of race and ensures that Justin Simien is a filmmaker to watch.</Review>
            <Review>A dagger-sharp satire, a film filled end-to-end with tiny sticks of dynamite, each lit carefully with a gleeful smirk.</Review>
            <Review>It is smart, funny and provocative without being rude, even if some of the actual events and behaviours depicted are shocking. The film itself is not the shocker, the things it says about how we see each other is the embarrassment.</Review>
            <Review>Dear White People is too smart for its own good.</Review>
            <Review>It's witty, boisterous and immensely likeable, but don't mistake its considerable charm and slick elegance for superficiality.</Review>
            <Review>Dear White People is less than the sum of its very polished parts -- a first feature that's just impressive enough to be frustrating.</Review>

            <Review>A well-made and well-shot companion piece to the album, telling the story of Nas' early life and the circumstances that led to his birth as a hip-hop legend.</Review>
            <Review>Time Is Illmatic does a terrific job of weaving hip-hop history into a highly personal story.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is inspiring and tragic, and, directed by street artist One9, it's captured in an artful, emotional way that will speak to an audience beyond rap fans.</Review>
            <Review>As both an origin story about a great artist and a distillation of '80s urban blight, it's as breathless and real as any street-corner rhyme.</Review>
            <Review>The album lives as a touchstone, and a turning point, in New York hip hop. The film may be far less significant, but it does bear witness to the music's greatness.</Review>
            <Review>Since many of the themes from "Illmatic" have become mere clichés in contemporary rap, this film serves as a reminder of the potential and the promise that hip-hop truly holds.</Review>
            <Review>Brief, informative and direct, the historical details post-Illmatic grow less interesting, yet the film's first half is electric and engaging.</Review>
            <Review>The result, directed by graffiti artist and first-time director One9 is less an ordered history of facts than an emotional snapshot of the artist's childhood and thoughts about where he is today.</Review>
            <Review>As humbling as hagiographies come.</Review>
            <Review>Paints a vivid portrait of all that Nas the artist and Nasir Jones the person are in a remarkably efficient 75-minute run time.</Review>
            <Review>You certainly don't have to be a pre-established fan to appreciate this picture, as sometimes just seeing how much something can mean to others is gratifying enough.</Review>
            <Review>An essential celebration of the New York rapper's groundbreaking 1994 album.</Review>

            <Review>A movie bearing as faux-naive a title as this has to make a pretty good case for itself. This it decidedly does not do.</Review>
            <Review>Potential peeps out occasionally in Hector and the Search for Happiness, but then flounders and gets lost in a bland sea of sentimentality and cultural myopia.</Review>
            <Review>While there's limited value in Hector's search for happiness and the dozen-plus "lessons" he learns about the emotional state, the film works nicely as a character piece.</Review>
            <Review>This film is a winner. It will not only entertain you, but also make you think about what it takes to bring happiness into your own life.</Review>
            <Review>A rancid, insulting, and cynical dramedy about a man who travels around the world to reconnect with his soul.</Review>
            <Review>Hector and The Search for Happiness wors because it's basically a "self-help" movie. [full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Hector and The Search for Happiness is a feel good movie that avoids feeling preachy at all times. [full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Full of good intentions and lessons, perhaps this was the reason to its great success as a book, but as a movie it fails entirely. [full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>In look and feel, Hector and the Search for Happiness is a cross between The Secret Life of Walter Mitty and Eat Pray Love and is only marginally better than those films.</Review>

Sieger is training in the new athletics team for the national relay championships and meets the intriguing and unpredictable Marc. The friendship that develops seems nothing out of the ordinary, but Sieger secretly harbours stronger feelings for Marc. He engages in a lonely struggle with himself when it emerges that Marc is also in love with him. With his best friend Stef, Sieger discovers a motocross track outside the village. Events soon take on a momentum of their own as Sieger quickly becomes involved with Jessica. At last, he counts for something in the eyes of his tough older brother Eddy, who is secretly using the track to tear around on a moped. Sieger keeps quiet about this to his father, who often clashes with the rebellious Eddy since their mother's death. Sieger tries to make peace between the two, but his mind is elsewhere, as he finds it increasingly difficult to deny his feelings for Marc.</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>There is more interest in food these days than ever, yet there is very little interest in the hands that pick it. Farmworkers who form the foundation of our fresh food industry are routinely abused and robbed of wages. In extreme cases they can be beaten, sexually harassed or even enslaved - all within the borders of the United States. Food Chains exposes the human cost in our food supply and the complicity of the supermarket industry. Supermarkets earn $4 trillion globally and have tremendous power over the agricultural system. Over the past 3 decades they have drained revenue from their supply chain leaving farmworkers in poverty and forced to work under subhuman conditions. Yet supermarkets take no responsibility for this. (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>In the city of dreams, a desperate actress will put it all on the line for the role of a lifetime... no matter what the cost. Determined to make it in Hollywood, aspiring actress Sarah Walker (Alexandra Essoe) spends her days working a dead-end job under the watchful eye of her patronizing boss, Carl (Pat Healy), enduring petty friendships with other struggling artists and competing actors (Amanda Fuller, Fabianne Therese, Noah Segan, Shane Coffey and Natalie Castillo) and going on countless casting calls in the hopes of finally catching her big break. After a series of strange auditions with a mysterious casting duo (Marc Senter &amp; Maria Olsen) from famed production company Astraeus Pictures, Sarah finally lands the leading role in their newest film. The producer (Lou Deszeran) thinks she has a bright future ahead of her, but this coveted opportunity comes with bizarre ramifications that will transform Sarah both mentally and physically into something beautiful and terrifying. From Travis Stevens, the producer of Cheap Thrills and Jodorowsky's Dune, Dennis Widmyer &amp; Kevin K�lsch's Starry Eyes is an occult tale of ambition, possession, and the true price of fame.(C) Official site</StoryLine>

            <Review>The degeneration into familiar genre tropes reduces the impact of the wittily satirical set-up, with the result that Starry Eyes fails to live up to its initial promise. But the film indicates genuine talent on the part of its directors/screenwriters.</Review>

            <Review>An age-old fable given a modern Hollywood twist, Starry Eyes is a sublimely satirical and horrific examination of the real price of blind ambition that isn't afraid to let things get nasty or weird.</Review>
            <Review>A rough, gritty indie combo of Faust and Black Swan -- set in the cutthroat world of young Hollywood.</Review>

            <Review>STARRY EYES' story is not uncommon, but its execution is grand. The film is harrowing and insightful, unafraid to go to places both dark and deep.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>It's not perfect. But it is special, especially for a mid-budget Hollywood action drama, and it has stuck firmly in my mind since that late-night screening last Friday.</Review>
            <Review>Stahelski and Leitch, both former stunt men, unsurprisingly tackle action sequences with glee... but the quieter scenes are more sophisticated, incorporating a sense of fantasy and visual splendor that almost makes the wafer-thin plot feel fresh.</Review>
            <Review>Yet, for all the film's stylishness and a body count worthy of a small civil war, there's no getting around the fact that stiff, stoic Reeves -- who is capable of a few funny, deadpan lines -- isn't a particularly compelling lead action figure.</Review>
            <Review>Stylishly violent and not much else.</Review>
            <Review>Action movies are about movement, and John Wick pursues that goal with remorseless verve.</Review>
            <Review>John Wick feels like action manna for its cleanly designed gun-fu sequences... but the revenge plotting is deeply dopey and we shouldn't have to choose one or the other.</Review>
            <Review>John Wick is the platonic ideal of a disposable action movie. It gives you everything you want, nothing you don't, and gets you in and out of the theater.</Review>
            <Review>Mindless fun on top of mindless fun, a one-note work with nothing at all to say, content to hit the same note for 90 minutes straight.</Review>
            <Review>This is an achievement on an action level that might not break new ground, but it's an extremely focused and competent crowd-pleaser.</Review>
            <Review>[A] blisteringly fun action romp.</Review>
            <Review>If John Wick is the best looking action film in recent memory, it's also bolstered by a phenomenal cast of actors who, be they in parts big or small, manage to craft three-dimensional characters out of stock archetypes.</Review>
            <Review>If you can put up with the constant gunfire and the aggressive score, John Wick offers ridiculous but satisfying action.</Review>

            <Review>The melodrama feels so hurried and half-baked that the end result isn't just disappointing. It's borderline infuriating.</Review>
            <Review>The sunlight is golden, the accent's rural (this one's set in Louisiana), people die, sagacious letters are read aloud.</Review>
            <Review>At a certain point ... the coincidences and tragic incidents start to pile up at a startling rate and nothing can be taken seriously.</Review>
            <Review>For all of the eventfulness it jams into a (poorly edited) two-hour package, The Best Of Me ends up extracting the best of absolutely no one.</Review>
            <Review>As a drama, it fails, but the camp value is high, making it more fun than your average would-be weeper. It's silly, but at least it's not a slog.</Review>
            <Review>Interminably long, dragging out its molasses heart through what seem like three different endings.</Review>
            <Review>You know what to expect: a star-crossed romance for lovers from different worlds, kisses in the rain, moonlight swims, fateful separations and the tragic death of at least one leading character.</Review>
            <Review>The Best of Me's chemistry lives in the idea of a second chance at first love - would you take it if you could? - but not between the actors, unfortunately.</Review>
            <Review>I would be amazed to hear even the most ardent Sparks fan defend it as anything more than rubbish.</Review>
            <Review>The Best of Me turns into a half-baked dramatic thriller, with violent confrontations, gunfights, plenty of nasty characters and one big scary action scene.</Review>
            <Review>This film could be a real tearjerker for Sparks fans; everyone else may find it tough to stomach.</Review>
            <Review>There's something heavy-handed, even for Sparks, in the telling of the couple's story, particularly when it comes to Dawson's family: they are leering, brutal embodiments of evil who function as handy plot devices.</Review>

            <Review>[Evans] carries Untold by admirably fulfilling the two essential functions of a period-movie hero: to enunciate comic-book dialogue with Shakespearean authority and to look great with his shirt off.</Review>
            <Review>Most of the time, I found myself feeling like I was waiting for a turn with the gaming controls.</Review>
            <Review>If you can selectively ignore this litany of inanity, you may find some substantial earthy pleasures in "Dracula Untold."</Review>
            <Review>The idea is to humanize one of the most fearful monsters in the Western crypt. But Dracula Untold goes way overboard, past domestication and into canonization.</Review>
            <Review>A generic vampire tale in the Underworld vein that comes closer to the infamous Van Helsing than a memorable re-interpretation of a legendary monster.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is the latest multiplex filler to co-opt a classic tale only to drown it in computer-generated murk. Even the title has the ring of something created by committee.</Review>
            <Review>It contains some interesting visuals, great sound editing, and a decent score by Game of Thrones' Ramin Djawadi. However, as a villain origin story, which it purports itself to be, Dracula Untold is an absolute failure.</Review>
            <Review>Neither Shore nor Evans can do much with Vlad's internal wrestling over good and evil, mostly because the writers have refused to define the struggle with a realistic psychology.</Review>
            <Review>Might be worth seeing solely for the moment when Dracula says, "I'm worth 1,000 boys and you know it."</Review>
            <Review>It's just a bunch of nonexistent people getting knocked over by nonexistent bats.</Review>
            <Review>Toothless, poorly scripted and drowning in an overload of pointless CGI, Dracula Untold just plain sucks, both as a medieval epic and as the supposed launching pad for a new generation of movie monsters.</Review>
            <Review>"Dracula Untold" is the story of how one man tried to save his homeland from an invading army. It's not about Bela Lugosi feasting on tender white necks in polite society. If you can get past this, then you might enjoy this origins story.</Review>

        <StoryLine>The first feature film from comedy leaders CollegeHumor, Coffee Town is an updated workplace comedy for the generation that works out of coffee shops. Will (Glenn Howerton) is a 30-something website manager who uses local caf�, Coffee Town, as his office. When the owners of the shop discuss plans to convert Coffee Town into a bar, Will enlists the help of his two best friends Chad and Gino (Steve Little and Ben Schwartz) to save his freeloading existence. In order to thwart the plans of Coffee Town's owners, the trio stages a robbery to create the illusion of an unsafe neighborhood not suitable for the proposed venue. Also standing in their way is Sam (Josh Groban), a disgruntled barista with delusions of grandeur-he wants to be a rock star-and Will's heartache over unrequited love for Becca (Adrianne Palicki).

        <Duration>94</Duration>
        <StoryLine>1864: as war ravages the nation, on the outskirts of the Civil War business as usual continues for slave-owners and traders. THE RETRIEVAL follows Will, a fatherless 13 year-old boy, who survives by working with a white bounty hunter gang who sends him to earn the trust of runaway slaves and wanted freedmen in order to lure them back to the South. On a dangerous mission into the free North to find Nate, a fugitive freedman, things go wrong, and Will and Nate find themselves alone and on the run. As the bond between them unexpectedly grows, Will becomes consumed by conflicting emotions as he faces a gut-wrenching final decision: to betray the father figure he's finally found, or risk being killed by his gang. Thrilling, but grounded in historical research, THE RETRIEVAL serves as an insight into the little-told story of the grey area between slavery and emancipation, and the horrific moral dilemma that comes with being forced to betray your fellow man.

            <Review>The Retrieval's potency transcends its scope. It shows you, in microcosm, the sacrifices that forge the conscience not only of a boy, but of a nation.</Review>
            <Review>"The Retrieval" comes at you like a haunting slip of a memory, one that writer-director Chris Eska retrieves from a mostly forgotten era in unforgettable ways.</Review>
            <Review>It is indeed a beautiful film, but with each horizon tinged with sadness. If it was an Instagram filter, it would probably be called melancholy or something.</Review>
            <Review>The movie's flaws are not missteps, but steps not taken.</Review>
            <Review>Low-budget period indies rarely inhabit their world as convincingly as does this drama, which is set in the South in 1864.</Review>
            <Review>Both in its structure and its dialogue, Eska's writing is similarly adroit, and he matches those accomplishments with the topnotch performances he gets from his three leads.</Review>
            <Review>The film is subtle at times, yet provides an intense depiction of internal destruction, betrayal and sacrifice.</Review>
            <Review>It's not a coming-of-age movie, and it's not a slavery movie. Nor is 'The Retrieval' a Civil War movie.</Review>
            <Review>... less a Civil War picture than a road movie and a coming-of-age tale.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 1980</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>87</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Sauve Qui Peut (la Vie), a pessimistic but visually stunning film, marks Jean-Luc Godard's return to cinema after having spent the 70s working in video. The film presents a few days in the lives of three people: Paul Godard (Jacques Dutronc ), a television producer; Denise Rimbaud (Nathalie Baye), his co-worker and ex-girlfriend; and Isabelle Riviera (Isabelle Huppert), a prostitute whom Paul has used. Denise wants to break up with Paul and move to the country. Isabelle wants to work for herself instead of her pimp. Paul just wants to survive. Their stories intersect when Paul brings Denise to the country cottage he is trying to rent and Isabelle comes to see it without knowing that the landlord has been her client. The film is broken into segments entitled "The Imaginary," "Commerce," "Life," and "Music." Each of the first three sections focuses on one character and the last section brings all three characters together. This complex film is often closer to an essay than a story; it uses slow motion and experimental techniques to explore questions of love, work, and the nature of cinema. Sauve Qui Peut (la Vie) was Godard's first film with his frequent collaborator Anne-Marie Mi�ville, who edited and co-wrote the film. ~ Louis Schwartz, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>If I'm complaining about this movie a lot for one I'm deeming better than fair, it's because I was frustrated by how its first-rate ingredients, Binoche chief among them, somehow failed to create a spectacular end result.</Review>
            <Review>This potent Norwegian drama by Erik Poppe, himself a veteran war photographer, opens with a gripping sequence.</Review>
            <Review>The whole cast is good, but as always, all roads lead to Binoche, who is wonderful.</Review>
            <Review>Poppe can't match the stunning opener of Binoche photographing a suicide bomber in Kabul with scenes of domesticity. But Binoche never falters. She's the film's fire and grieving heart.</Review>
            <Review>Poppe crafts some powerful scenes that pose questions not easily answered.</Review>
            <Review>What makes "1,000 Times Good Night" more than a dramatic essay on wartime journalism is Ms. Binoche's wrenchingly honest portrayal ...</Review>
            <Review>The geopolitical realities of 2015 entitle us to expect something more nuanced than this.</Review>
            <Review>Shot with a gorgeous eye, the filmmakers aren't afraid of lens flare or overexposure to add an ethereal beauty to horrific circumstances of which we're bracing for impact.</Review>
            <Review>Binoche is impressive, bringing a steely, self-contained detachment to even the most intimate moments with her family. But Erik Poppe, the director, slathers the film in overly sentimental music choices</Review>
            <Review>Alas, following on from such a striking and tense opening was always going to be difficult. The focus swiftly shifts to an account of disturbed domesticity, and so does the A Thousand Times Good Night's effectiveness and interest.</Review>
            <Review>Anger and anguish visible in her eyes and etched in the lines of her face, Juliette Binoche delivers a terrific performance.</Review>
            <Review>It's a rich, fascinating and provocative film that never takes sides or opts for easy answers.</Review>

            <Review>For viewers, Brandon's action feels tragic and inexcusable. The hard part is how to respond to it, and Valentine Road, like much of "the system," doesn't suggest any easy answer.</Review>
            <Review>Moving and infuriating ...</Review>
            <Review>Though the ugly phobia that gave rise to the killing and permeated the legal proceedings boils the blood, the film's tone is somber rather than angry, and its effect is quietly devastating.</Review>
            <Review>Plumbs the pathetic depths of intolerance and distorted compassion in one of the supposedly most liberal states in the union. Its panoramic and both-sides approach to a brutal, traumatizing act of retaliatory violence chills and stills the heart.</Review>

            <Review>Zenovich has assembled better-than-usual talking heads, all sympathetic even when dishing the worst bad behavior.</Review>
            <Review>Omit the Logic is more likely to omit laughter as it focuses on Pryor's false career starts, drug use, depression, multiple marriages and divorces, his struggles with MS, and the infamous incident in which the comedian set himself on fire.</Review>
            <Review>This may be a jet-ski ride over Pryor's life rather than a deep-sea dive but it offers a firm celebration that's likely to encourage those who have watched it to seek out more material from the man himself - and that can never be a bad thing.</Review>
            <Review>As a showcase of Pryor's talent and influence, Omit the Logic is undeniably fun. It just feels a little slight given the massive cultural influence of its subject matter.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2012</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>84</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Tales of the Night is renowned animation auteur Michel Ocelot's first foray into 3D animation. A hit at the Berlin Film Festival, the film extends the earlier shadow puppet style of Ocelot's Princes and Princesses, with black silhouetted characters set off against exquisitely detailed Day-Glo backgrounds bursting with color and kaleidoscopic patterns - the subtle use of 3D creating a diorama-like effect. The film weaves together six exotic fables each unfolding in a unique locale, from Tibet, to medieval Europe, an Aztec kingdom, the African plains, and even the Land of the Dead. In Ocelot's storytelling, history blends with fairytale as viewers are whisked off to enchanted lands full of dragons, werewolves, captive princesses, sorcerers, and enormous talking bees - and each fable ends with its own ironic twist. -- (C) GKIDS</StoryLine>

        <Title>Jews And Baseball: An American Love Story</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2010</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>91</Duration>
        <StoryLine>JEWS AND BASEBALL: AN AMERICAN LOVE STORY explores the connection between Jewish Americans and baseball, our nation's most iconic institution. More than a film about sports, it is a story of immigration, assimilation, bigotry, heroism, the passing on of traditions, and the shattering of stereotypes "You should be an attorney or a doctor, but not a ballplayer," one former major leaguer remembers, describing the prejudices that he and other Jewish athletes faced. But despite the stereotypes, and in the face of hostility from fans and even violence from opposing players, there have been standout Jewish players in every decade from the 1860s to the present. JEWS AND BASEBALL is the first major documentary to tell their stories. Interviews include fans, writers, executives, and especially players - including Al Rosen, Kevin Youkilis, Shawn Green, Norm Sherry, Ron Blomberg, Bob Feller, Yogi Berra, and a rare interview with the legendary Hall of Fame pitcher Sandy Koufax. Fans Ron Howard and Larry King speak of the meaning of Jewish ballplayers in their own lives, while historians and even two baseball-loving rabbis relate the stories of Jewish players to the turbulent history of the last century. These powerful personal and historical stories are interwoven with an extraordinary collection of rare archival footage and photos, and a musical score ranging from Benny Goodman to Yo-Yo Ma to Rush. Dustin Hoffman narrates this engaging story of great drama, unforgettable games, and the broad sweep of American history. --&amp;copy; Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>"Jews and Baseball: An American Love Story" not only lives up to its title -- how could it not? -- but also delivers a bit extra as well.</Review>
            <Review>Were it not for a masterly production coup...this slight and unambitious work would be wholly indistinguishable from basic-cable filler.</Review>
            <Review>A reasonably comprehensive tribute to athletics as the great melting pot.</Review>
            <Review>Peter Miller's historical docu strikes out a stadium-load of assumptions.</Review>
            <Review>I doubt there's much here any die-hard fan doesn't already know, but having it retold from the perspective of a struggling, respect-hungry community merely makes the metaphoric affinities of the game that much more persuasive.</Review>
            <Review>The organization, the writing by Ira Berkow, the footage, the research, all excellent. But it could have been so much more.</Review>
            <Review>It's a must for baseball fans-Jewish or otherwise.</Review>
            <Review>This engaging and well-put-together documentary has universal appeal to sports fans, regardless of ethnic background. It has a running time of 91 minutes that passes by much too quickly.</Review>
            <Review>Good info. But Jews and Baseball is too genteel, too reverential and not nearly exciting enough.</Review>
            <Review>(Prioritizes) statistics and on-field accomplishments over larger questions of religion, culture and community.</Review>
            <Review>The film feels simultaneously micromanaged and slapdash, spouting generalities about the game while neglecting to show a full at-bat.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>Akhavan's most effective resource as a storyteller is her own face, a sometimes Chaplinesque blend of farce and pathos. She is a big talent to watch.</Review>
            <Review>Akhavan's confidently off-kilter approach to basic human interaction makes for an authentically ironic, adorably wistful, smartly observed ride.</Review>
            <Review>There's a lot to get across here, a lot of information, but the real strength of "Appropriate Behavior" is that you can sense, in every scene, that Akhavan really has something to say.</Review>
            <Review>For all its disorganization and lack of an ending or even a sense of direction, "Appropriate Behavior" is alive.</Review>
            <Review>It seems poised to become a similar cult classic for young urbanites.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately, Appropriate Behavior works almost in spite of itself ...</Review>
            <Review>Approaching contentious topics with clarity and tact and attempting to find the correct balance between irony and outright offence within a comedic context can often be a tricky affair.</Review>
            <Review>Appropriate Behavior marks a strong first-time effort for the director, and establishes her ability as both a filmmaker and as an actress with considerable screen presence.</Review>
            <Review>Ms. Akhavan shows promise as an assured director, a talented writer and an interesting actress.</Review>
            <Review>What seems most promising about Akhavan's directing talent is her very specific eye.</Review>
            <Review>The terrific film captures, among other things, the terror of trying to get back into the dating scene when you don't really fit into any scene.</Review>
            <Review>This deeply flawed debut is worth checking out. Akhavan is definitely one to watch.</Review>

            <Review>I'd praise Horovitz for going the darker route if My Old Lady wasn't so wrenchingly obvious and Kevin Kline's character wasn't so venal and cruel.</Review>
            <Review>It's too twee and theatrical to take seriously.</Review>
            <Review>My Old Lady feels as stubbornly stuck in that expansive and underlit apartment as Madame Girard herself, and you may find yourself bolting for a lungful of relief.</Review>
            <Review>One minute we're chuckling along with a broadly comic setup; the next, characters are talking about suicide.</Review>
            <Review>There's a potentially compelling movie here about the price that children pay-over entire lifetimes-for their parents' selfish indulgences, but it winds up smothered in feel-good cuteness.</Review>
            <Review>Kline's character is an alcoholic and not exactly lovable, but we come to empathize. Smith, the grande dame of British theater and film, is wickedly wry and quick.</Review>
            <Review>A movie chock full of cliches, very predictable ones, although undeniably entertaining. [Full Review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>I needed a little something to lift my spirits, and I found "My Old Lady" did the trick.</Review>
            <Review>Kline and Smith have some nice moments together, even if the transition from breezy comedy into more serious drama is clumsy.</Review>
            <Review>Just when you think the story is going to proceed on a well-worn, cosily romantic track, its characters unpack their emotional baggage, revealing unexpected depths of hurt and taking the film into bittersweet dramatic territory.</Review>
            <Review>It's solidly predictable and somewhat grating, only partially redeemed by a reliably watchable cast.</Review>
            <Review>As we learn more about the tormented family backgrounds, broken love affairs and suicide attempts of the protagonists, the film begins to sag under the weight of its characters' mounting self-pity.</Review>

            <Review>May we be excused, "Miss Meadows"?</Review>
            <Review>It exists somewhere between serious character study and satirical fish-out-of-water story, never figuring out which it wants to be.</Review>
            <Review>Despite an eccentric streak (which turns erratic), the script doesn't allow much room for the premise to take flight.</Review>
            <Review>Hopkins fails to fulfill the potential of her own script.</Review>
            <Review>As an ostensible work of satire, it lacks bite, never truly questioning or complicating its heroine's actions; the film isn't even outrageous enough to be appalling (which paradoxically makes it appalling).</Review>
            <Review>Miss Meadows is an interesting character study of someone just trying to make the world a better place through murder, and questioning whether her methods may actually be the cause of the world's decay.</Review>
            <Review>... struggles to find a consistent tone, and doesn't offer sufficient context to give emotional resonance to a female-empowerment fantasy that ultimately feels too detached from reality.</Review>
            <Review>Isn't a terribly convincing movie, but it does feature a refreshingly twisted turn from star Katie Holmes.</Review>
            <Review>An uneven mix of exploitation, satire and misguided social commentary.</Review>
            <Review>It's so relentlessly upbeat and deliberately artificial that it admits no cynicism or judgment, and it makes the film daringly weird.</Review>

        <StoryLine>DAYS AND NIGHTS is writer/director Christian Camargo's directorial debut, inspired by Anton Chekhov's The Seagull and set in rural New England in the 1980s. The film centers around Elizabeth (Allison Janney), a movie star, who brings her paramour Peter (Christian Camargo) to her lakeside estate to visit her family on Memorial Day weekend. The household includes her ailing brother (William Hurt), her artist son (Ben Whishaw), his ethereal muse (Juliet Rylance), the family doctor (Jean Reno) and the estate's custodian (Russell Means), the careless caretaker (Michael Nyqvist) and his wife (Cherry Jones), their temperamental daughter (Katie Holmes) and her long suffering ornithologist husband (Mark Rylance) -- the keeper of the sacred land where a bald eagle is trying to raise its young. During the weekend a disastrous turn of events leads the family from dysfunction to heartbreak and, ultimately, salvation. (C) IFC Films</StoryLine>

            <Review>The cast, so packed with talent that Jean Reno and Cherry Jones barely register, is stuck with stagey dialogue. Juliet Rylance, in the Nina part, has a particularly hard time.</Review>
            <Review>In a movie, nothing good ever seems to happen at a country house. And when it comes to this film, nothing very interesting happens, either.</Review>
            <Review>One can certainly give this movie A for effort, but the achievement falls far short of the lofty intentions.</Review>
            <Review>At 92 minutes, Days and Nights feels choppy and hurried, pushing the narrative toward inevitable tragedy rather than exploring how these dispirited people got there.</Review>
            <Review>Lines are read as if unrelated to the ones that came before it, giving conversations a stilted, unnatural coldness.</Review>
            <Review>It's difficult to invest emotionally in these lugubrious characters and their various avenues of depression and dysfunction.</Review>
            <Review>Those who are familiar with the comedic drama are likely to find Camargo's ideas interesting, if a bit obligatory, while those who have neither read nor seen "The Seagull" may just come away thinking of it as a pretentious art film.</Review>
            <Review>This god-awful reimagining of a Chekhov masterpiece will only have you yearning to see Sidney Lumet's underrated 1968 version.</Review>
            <Review>The drama over dinner comes in small analgesic portions, and the secrets feel canned and the dialogue is too pretty to be believable.</Review>
            <Review>Camargo maintains an odd relationship with the source material, his script lost in the limbo between 'inspired by' and 'adapted from.'</Review>

            <Review>This seemingly ordinary biographical documentary about the retiring animation master unfolds, at a deceptively gentle pace, into a work of immense beauty.</Review>
            <Review>A fitting coda to a great career.</Review>
            <Review>[It] does the world a service by chronicling and preserving, in a most charming and understated way, Miyazaki-era Ghibli and the human element beneath its creative genius.</Review>
            <Review>One last peek behind the curtain at the masterful Studio Ghibli</Review>
            <Review>Mami Sunada's documentary, while quite the insider's and fan's film, is also a deeply elegiac portrait of the labour and laboriousness, flecked with uncertainty and doubt, behind some of the finest art- and imagination-fuelled films of the past 30 years.</Review>
            <Review>If the magic of this magic kingdom is no longer concentrated in this particular pile of bricks and mortar on the outskirts of Tokyo, we can take heart in the fact that it's immortalized forever in every frame of every film that Ghibli ever made.</Review>
            <Review>Miyazaki dispenses endlessly quotable observations. For example: 'Filmmaking only brings suffering... How do we know movies are even worthwhile? If you really think about it, is this not just some grand hobby?'</Review>

            <Review>Kidman and Firth are both excellent in their sadness and savagery, and Joffe builds tension far better than most of the horror movies available at your local Cineplex this Halloween weekend.</Review>
            <Review>There's no edge, no pulp, no grit under its fingernails.</Review>
            <Review>It's shallow, it's silly, it's pat. It's... forgettable.</Review>
            <Review>Throbbing musical crescendos and flickery flashbacks abound but apart from some outlandish plot machinations, nothing here is good or bad enough to be memorable.</Review>
            <Review>With luck, Kidman will erase this inept thriller from her memory as quickly as it leaves theaters.</Review>
            <Review>It isn't Hitchcock, but it will do.</Review>
            <Review>There are a lot of decent jolts and pregnant pauses that build to an unexpectedly emotional ending - there won't be that much new if you've read the book, but it's still an intriguing premise all the same.</Review>
            <Review>Ssuperbly acted and, for much of its intricately plotted length, grips like a vice.</Review>
            <Review>What went wrong in this adaptation?</Review>
            <Review>It takes only 90 minutes (it seems longer) to get to an ambiguous ending that is typical of the cynical way mysteries are scripted nowadays.</Review>
            <Review>...seriously lackluster...</Review>

            <Review>A theologically questionable but fitfully exciting melodrama about fear and loathing among the non-Raptured.</Review>
            <Review>There's a fundamental problem here. The movie relies on the instinctual human fear of death, but its message is that dying is a promotion.</Review>
            <Review>Some will balk at the idea of a faith based horror film, however The Remaining successfully manages to walk the fine line between bloody-minded entertainment and religious discourse.</Review>
            <Review>Nimbly directed by Casey La Scala, and performed with engaging conviction, this Book of Revelations faith-based shocker is surprisingly effective.</Review>
            <Review>Its physical form is in cinemas; its soul is already circling the 24-hour garage bargain bin.</Review>
            <Review>Like Paranormal Activity at a wedding - Paranuptial Activity? - this low-budget horror has its moments. Much, much better than Legion, although not as scary as the actual Book of Revelation.</Review>
            <Review>The human dramas are deftly sketched, the performances decent, and the religious hand-wringing just bearable.</Review>
            <Review>Horror movie about the Rapture has deaths, scares.</Review>
            <Review>The Remaining has to qualify as one of the most stirringly adequate, totally acceptable explicitly Christian horror movies ever made.</Review>

            <Review>Not dissimilar in merrily ghoulish spirit to 'The Nightmare Before Christmas', it's hugely entertaining.</Review>
            <Review>Such a crowded, colorful, more-is-not-nearly-enough aesthetic could easily have felt garish and confusing. But for some reason, it doesn't.</Review>
            <Review>This Mexican fiesta of animated splendor is packed with visual delights far more sunny than sinister as they burst forth as if flung from an over-packed piñata.</Review>
            <Review>Without a doubt, it is one of 2014's best animated films; a holiday delight that exuberantly bursts at the seams with irresistible cultural pride.</Review>
            <Review>Whether en ingles o en espanol, The Book of Life is a delight. In an animated universe cluttered with kung-fu pandas, ice princesses and video-game heroes, Gutierrez and del Toro have conjured up an original vision.</Review>
            <Review>The Book of Life moves breezily from one scene to the next, keeping the pace brisk and rarely skipping a beat.</Review>
            <Review>Though visually eye-popping, where The Book of Life shines is in the unique way it presents the themes we see in all family films; the importance of family and being true to yourself.</Review>
            <Review>Colourful and fast-moving, this animated film mines myths around the Mexican Day of the Dead to create a children's story about death.</Review>
            <Review>A colorful, joyous and buoyant lark that draws more from Mexican tradition and Greek myth than ghoulish Burton-esque kitsch.</Review>
            <Review>The Mexi-centricity is novel and welcome, as is the flirtation with morbidness, but the film overall is filled with the usual trademarks of sub-Pixar animation: glib one-liners, anachronistic pop-culture references, and inspirational cliches.</Review>
            <Review>The Book of Life is a fun children's movie that is unlike most of what's being released in English-language markets for any demographic.</Review>
            <Review>Don't be fooled by the cutely-drawn characters on the poster promoting The Book of Life. For this is one of the more original and ambitious (in storytelling terms, at least) animated offerings of recent times.</Review>

            <Review>"Why Don't You Play in Hell" is violent and irreverent, packed full with crazy ideas, and about as much bloody fun as you can have in a theater right now.</Review>
            <Review>Sono achieves a level of insanity that most filmmakers wouldn't even dare to challenge, turning Why Don't You Play In Hell? into a uniquely decadent cinematic treat that delivers exactly as advertised.</Review>

        <StoryLine>The untold story behind History, a well-kept secret behind the world-wide icon : Nelson Mandela's release was a Plot for Peace. PLOT FOR PEACE is a character-driven historical thriller documentary feature about the demise of apartheid. It tells the story of Jean-Yves Ollivier, alias "Monsieur Jacques", whose behind-the-scenes bargaining was instrumental in bringing about regional peace and the end of racial discrimination in South Africa. For the first time, heads of state, generals, diplomats, master spies and anti-apartheid fighters reveal how Africa's front line states helped end apartheid. The improbable key to Mandela's prison cell was a mysterious French businessman, dubbed "Monsieur Jacques" in classified correspondence. His trade secret was trust. (C) Trinity</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>James Franco, Mila Kunis, Jessica Chastain, and Zach Braff star in this dramatic and inventive look at the life and work of ionic Pulitzer Prize-winning poet C.K. Williams. Williams (Franco) has a beautiful, adoring wife (Kunis) and a young son. But as he prepares for a reading in New York City and struggles to create new work, he is haunted by memories of his past-from his first sexual encounter to a later tragic loss. An ensemble of 12 directors work with a star-studded cast to weave together this moving and unique story of a complex man and the relationships that defined him. (C) Starz</StoryLine>

            <Review>Based on Pulitzer Prize-winning poet C.K. Williams's autobiographical work, "The Color of Time" is about poetry, though it has none to speak of.</Review>
            <Review>"The Color of Time" is an odd bird in that its 12 cooks don't necessarily spoil the broth. The problem is that they leave it as broth.</Review>
            <Review>The film is too sincere an expression of admiration for this poet's work to feel pretentious, but it's like a music video for the poems, often literal in its biographical readings.</Review>
            <Review>A cool concept, and A for effort.</Review>
            <Review>Franco makes a lot of art, both good and bad. But no one provides a bolder example of the vanishing lines that used to separate movie stars, fringe artists, and working actors.</Review>
            <Review>The uniformity of its languorous, lens-flared visuals may wear on all but the most ardent Terrence Malick devotees, many of whom, I suspect, are also grad students.</Review>
            <Review>Either Franco thinks his every creative whim doesn't stink, and we should be delighted to sample all his artistic endeavors, or he's a selfless, mentoring, caring teacher.</Review>
            <Review>The idea of students collaborating with a stable of famous actors is a wonderful story in itself, but to then treat the culmination of the exercise as more than a student thesis film does it a disservice.</Review>
            <Review>This dreamlike film, directed by twelve graduate students from New York University, fails to make celebrated American poet C.K. Williams much more than a mildly interesting daydream. Despite its top acting talent, it even inspires a deeper sleep.</Review>
            <Review>The Color of Time serves as a reminder that literalizing and adapting poetry for the screen is usually not a good idea.</Review>
            <Review>Probably should have stayed in the classroom.</Review>
            <Review>"The Color of Time," for all the experimentalism of its conception, falls some way short here, and ends up an irreproachably tasteful, easily digestible, but an unsurprising, undemanding watch.</Review>

            <Review>There are a number of fine reasons to see the courtroom-meets-family melodrama The Judge. As you might suspect, two stand out: actors Robert Duvall and Robert Downey Jr.</Review>
            <Review>A charismatic performance from Downey Jr and the growling presence of Duvall make up for a multitude of sins in this big and brash family drama .</Review>
            <Review>I don't expect The Judge to usher in a new era of legal thrillers, but I'm happy to see Downey leave the Marvel universe and Baker Street behind.</Review>
            <Review>It wants to be many movies, and fails at being even one of them.</Review>
            <Review>This is not by any means a bad movie. The script has its bright patches, the setting is picturesque, and the cast is full of actors you'll want to see.</Review>
            <Review>An overstuffed, overlong slog of a legal drama. Director David Dobkin coats every cliché with cheap theatrics. Go ahead, see The Judge just for Downey and Duvall. But to cite another recent dud, this is where I leave you.</Review>
            <Review>It remains watchable to the very end, mostly thanks to a stolid cast that absolutely refuses to be sucked into the muddied tropes that make up the screenplay.</Review>
            <Review>One of those films that goes under the radar but has everything in it, making it a great film. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>The main plot anchors itself with quite a lot of naturalism, an ironic half-smile, and that measured point of repulsion-attraction mastered by the great Luchini, expert on human toads that tie us with their tongues. [Full Review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Love affairs and literature. Rom-com and courtroom drama. The mix isn't really promising, but Christian Vincent manages to make a good marriage out of them. [Full Review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>The familial dysfunction is familiar and cliched, but the two complement each other nicely. Duvall makes the audience, and Hank, work to get to know him, and by the time the denouement rolls around you are glad Hank kept on prodding.</Review>
            <Review>The Judge has a few good things going for it... What the film doesn't have is faith that the audience can appreciate solid dramatic acting for more than, oh, three minutes at a stretch.</Review>

            <Review>An impressively solid World War II movie of the kind they don't make anymore.</Review>
            <Review>While these orgies of violence are staged with tense, gruesome precision, they don't convey much beyond what we already know. Namely, that war is hell. Message received.</Review>
            <Review>Pitt, who at 50 still looks great with his shirt off, has the gruff charisma to play a dauntless soldier with killer courage and a vestigial streak of humanity.</Review>
            <Review>It's an "unflinching" account of war -- "unflinching," in quotes, because every moment of the film is composed to grind your face into the muck and be proud of itself for doing so.</Review>
            <Review>Pitt is at the top of his game, playing a man who has forgotten whatever he used to be and has wholly embraced his role in this war.</Review>
            <Review>Led by Pitt, who sublimates his persona so deeply into Wardaddy that you can forget about his movie star baggage, the cast is exceptional.</Review>
            <Review>Fury is a well crafted, incredibly taut war film, one that sets aside the Great Man Theory of war and instead focuses on war-fighting men.</Review>
            <Review>Yes war is hell (again), but Fury manages to its own special kind of hell. One hell of a tank movie it is too.</Review>
            <Review>A beautifully brutal work that pulls zero punches, gives zero damns, and willfully mucks around in the muddy moral waters that comprise war.</Review>
            <Review>Fury's violent decapitations and exploding torsos feel exploitative or, worse, uninteresting, because the film never quite earns the dramatic stakes it strives for.</Review>
            <Review>Ayer is like Sam Peckinpah without the self-loathing, or the poetry.</Review>
            <Review>A gut-wrenching look at the depressing and vicious ramifications of war.</Review>

            <Review>You can respect that it was made for a fraction of the cost of the average, similarly politically superficial American action-thriller, but that doesn't make the failure any more noble.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately, despite all its toughness, the film's flaws make it a little too vulnerable to stand up on its own.</Review>

            <Review>A thoroughly enjoyable and fascinating documentary about Landis' amazing feats as a forger and con man.</Review>
            <Review>It's the kind of story a filmmaker dreams of - and yet, "Art and Craft" leaves the viewer uneasy.</Review>
            <Review>Perhaps the year's most delightfully charming documentary.</Review>
            <Review>Sam Cullman, Jennifer Grausman, and Mark Becker, the directors of "Art and Craft," have themselves an enticing subject in Landis's activities. They do not have an enticing subject in Landis himself.</Review>
            <Review>Directors Sam Cullman and Jennifer Grausman maintain a bright tone and a melancholy undercurrent, which combine in an eminently watchable character study.</Review>
            <Review>Wonderful and not a little sad.</Review>
            <Review>This documentary about one of the most prolific forgers in history is a fascinating character study of two men, the forger, a man compelled to copy works of art and pass them off as originals, and the man compelled to stop him from from doing that.</Review>
            <Review>The moviemakers have created a unique portrait of a highly unusual, gifted oddball who is -- unlike his paintings -- a true original.</Review>
            <Review>Operating out of a crummy lifelong bachelor's apartment, this prolific art forger is an unassuming and even sympathetic mastermind. With his tall, thin frame and baldish head, he resembles an El Greco Eisenhower, accessorized with Alfred E. Neuman ears.</Review>
            <Review>An insightful glimpse into mental illness and an obsession with fame. Just the story of a mild-mannered con man with issues. A film worth viewing.</Review>

            <Review>If only it weren't such a disturbingly retro and sadistically sensationalized take on the subject. If only it were any good at all.</Review>
            <Review>Like some of King's other tales, it loses its way, devolving into a rape revenge fantasy whose potency is diluted by silly gimmicks like a talking GPS system with a mind of its own.</Review>
            <Review>Solid star turn, eerie production values, even a killer ending. Nice symmetry, Steve.</Review>
            <Review>Such commercial considerations notwithstanding, in the wake of a recent run of cynical Lifetime movie topics, from Saved by the Bell to Brittany Murphy, Big Driver runs into another creative dead end.</Review>
            <Review>A few horror-story cliches seep in, but with Bello playing a character who is strikingly unglamorous and at times not even sympathetic, Big Driver should deliver for its audience.</Review>
            <Review>It's too simple and straightforward for its own good.</Review>
            <Review>You've gotta really be willing to throw logic out the window to enjoy "Big Driver," a revenge-thriller based on the Stephen King novella. But, as TV movies go, it isn't that bad and certainly the cast is excellent.</Review>
            <Review>An often toothless and ridiculous rape revenge thriller...</Review>
            <Review>It's a powerful film - not because its story of a vengeful female will shine a light on social injustices, but simply because it grips viewers and doesn't let go until the credits are rolling. Maria Bello is a pain-stricken wonder.</Review>
            <Review>Big Driver is slimmer in content, as well as form, than Misery, but it is nonetheless gripping.</Review>

            <Review>A thriller with so many viewpoints, feints and fake-outs that it swiftly disappears up its own URL.</Review>

            <Review>The larger questions Coherence asks us to consider about parallel worlds are interesting, if not exactly original, while absurdist touches help elevate it from more traditional thrillers.</Review>
            <Review>At once a suspenseful mind game and a wily mash-up of surreal quantum physics theories, this low-cost thriller proves that something approaching brilliance is not just a function of budget.</Review>
            <Review>James Ward Byrkit completes his journey from storyboard artist...to writer-director with this overextended but mostly enjoyable trip into the Twilight Zone.</Review>
            <Review>The film's not perfect-the hand-held camerawork sometimes distracts from the unnerving mood-but it's a good, spooky mind-bender.</Review>
            <Review>[The] surprises, while cleverly doled out over the film's brisk 88-minute running time, don't entirely offset the general displeasure of spending time with this particular circle of friends, lovers and old flames ...</Review>
            <Review>"Coherence" is proof that inventive filmmakers can do a lot with a little.</Review>
            <Review>Coherence is a smart, tense genre outing that thoroughly shows up big-budget tent-poles with its superior inventiveness.</Review>
            <Review>Keep your ears open and your eyes peeled because Coherence is all about the details.</Review>
            <Review>A no-budget, mind-bending exercise in the fragility of human relationships with a bit of quantum physics thrown in, Coherence is thoughtful and well-made thriller with a hint of mystery to it that simmers nicely below the surface.</Review>
            <Review>It's a great little movie, intelligent and creepy.</Review>
            <Review>Coherence's brilliance comes from forcing the question of whether we truly know what we're capable of.</Review>

            <Review>Green in particular seems to be channeling the bride of Frankenstein for half her scenes. It's an awkward mix of styles, and it doesn't work.</Review>
            <Review>An enjoyable, if uneven, adaptation of Laura Kasischke's coming-of-age novel about a teenage girl whose mother vanishes into thin air.</Review>
            <Review>'White Bird in a Blizzard" develops engine trouble early on, right around the time it asks us to accept Eva Green as a desperate suburban housewife.</Review>
            <Review>Oh, the small-town/suburban horror of it all.</Review>
            <Review>"White Bird in a Blizzard" is an odd little concoction, a coming-of-age story that, only in passing, is also a mystery.</Review>
            <Review>Kudos to Woodley -- star of a major film franchise, the young-adult dystopian The Divergent Series -- for taking on more unusual projects.</Review>
            <Review>Araki's latest drama is a refreshingly frank coming-of-age story, featuring another great performance from Woodley.</Review>
            <Review>Woodley reminds us that she's not just the hippie queen of YA adaptations, but a bracing actress who's not averse to taking some gutty risks.</Review>
            <Review>It's Woodley who steals the show with her underplayed and heartbreaking performance as a girl suddenly bereft of her overbearing mother.</Review>
            <Review>A misguided personal trip that rambles confusedly between drama and mystery, without guaranteeing genuine interest. [Full Review in Spanish]</Review>

            <Review>Fascinating, maddening, and ultimately very sad.</Review>
            <Review>The film not only canonizes its hero - who committed suicide amid a nasty federal indictment against him - but also brushes aside any big-picture concerns about national security and Internet piracy.</Review>

            <Review>Deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Documentary.</Review>

            <Review>A brilliant and idealistic soul sacrificed at the altar of Barack Obama's war on intellectual and political transparency.</Review>
            <Review>Passionately tells a tragic tale of injustice.</Review>
            <Review>I was hesitant about seeing this movie. I thought it was just another film glamorizing suicidal people. It turns out to be more of a celebration of the short, but incredibly productive life of Aron Swartz and the things he stood for.</Review>
            <Review>Knappenberger argues that the case against Swartz was overzealously pursued in order to make an example of him and on the evidence presented here it's hard to disagree.</Review>
            <Review>Brian Knappenberger's captivating film gives much to think about, including what oversight should be required when the government looks into our lives.</Review>
            <Review>An essential - and enraging - documentary about the life, career, and death of Internet activist Aaron Swartz, a danger to corporate hegemony whose work could not be allowed to continue.</Review>

            <Review>It's a movie that raises as many questions as it addresses, and which never quite convincingly answers even the most pressing one: Just what made the son of a radical Palestinian-liberation leader go to work as an Israeli spy?</Review>
            <Review>The movie's empty pizzazz is especially irritating because the story would have been compelling without any embellishment.</Review>
            <Review>It's a harrowing tale of intrigue and betrayal, but also one of a friendship that survives despite extraordinary circumstances.</Review>
            <Review>[A] gripping documentary set against the internecine battle between Israel and Palestine.</Review>
            <Review>This a film that leaves many unanswered questions, but it's nonetheless satisfying, because it resonates emotionally and offers a ray of hope that the human spirit has the ability to trump entrenched political perspectives.</Review>
            <Review>These interviews complement rather than contradict each other.</Review>
            <Review>"The Green Prince" is a dramatized documentary based on Yousef's autobiography, "Son of Hamas." And, while I don't particularly care for reenactments, I do believe Israeli filmmaker Nadav Schirman did an excellent job of bringing Yousef's story to film.</Review>
            <Review>Though no film really has a hope of untangling the complexities of the conflict, this succeeds in putting a human face on them.</Review>
            <Review>It's a remarkable story, told with slick thriller flair, focusing increasingly on the interdependence of its subjects, who chose personal morality over political rhetoric, with isolating results.</Review>
            <Review>Schirman, a young Israeli film-maker, has gotten hold of an extraordinary espionage story and - how could he not? - turned it into an undeniably gripping documentary.</Review>
            <Review>Depending on your perspective, Nadav Schirman's troubling documentary is either a story about heroism and friendship or a study in extreme treachery and bad faith.</Review>
            <Review>Taut dramatic reconstructions and an extraordinary story of strained allegiances, subterfuge and an unexpected friendship makes the The Green Prince as tense as any Hollywood thriller.</Review>

            <Review>As a vehicle for those two actors, The Drop is gangbusters.</Review>
            <Review>It's a classic case of a little becoming a lot onscreen on the basis of a single impressive performance.</Review>
            <Review>You have to sit through the slow parts to savor the cool parts. The movie's little surprise is that you didn't waste your time watching it; you were just being primed for an explosion of low volume and high impact.</Review>
            <Review>This is a movie you stumble across when hunting for something to watch: goodish, with the right dreary atmosphere.</Review>
            <Review>The Drop's unpredictability is organic rather than sensationalistic. The movie doesn't pull surprises out of thin air for the sole purpose of shocking an audience - it lets them develop naturally.</Review>
            <Review>Not that it needed demonstrating, but Hardy once again shows what quiet force and phenomenal range he has. He's like a young Liam Neeson with Michael Fassbender chops.</Review>
            <Review>A puppy upstages James Gandolfini in his final film.</Review>
            <Review>'The Drop' reminds us of what Gandolfini always did well: providing support, heft, and color, in the tradition of our finest character actors.</Review>
            <Review>The film has loose ends and doesn't quite catch fire but the ending is excellent and lifts it over the line.</Review>
            <Review>Gandolfini died suddenly, at age 51, shortly after finishing The Drop. That leaves us hanging on his every exquisitely timed pause, and sensing the sheer weight of his personality every time he enters a room.</Review>
            <Review>Free of the extraneous nuts and bolts that so often come with crime dramas, turning simple moments like a well-placed umbrella into something genuinely menacing.</Review>
            <Review>Aside from a few memorable exchanges and effective bursts of violence, The Drop could've use more imagination to distinguish itself from the pack.</Review>

            <Review>Quality is often irrelevant in a horror movie; shock is the key.</Review>
            <Review>The script, by Gary Dauberman, is a clichéd mess, lacking humor and surprises. But Leonetti stages some fright-worthy sequences ...</Review>
            <Review>What about this movie is supposed to scare us?</Review>
            <Review>What we mostly get in Annabelle is what we've gotten from so many other horror films: creaking floors, funky white-robed figures, home appliances that go off on their own, mysterious writing that shows up in mysterious places.</Review>
            <Review>Annabelle, an effective prequel to horror pastiche The Conjuring, surpasses its predecessor simply by virtue of occasionally being scary.</Review>
            <Review>Although [Leonetti] covers no new ground - things are largely predictable - he pays tribute to horror classics such as "Rosemary's Baby."</Review>
            <Review>In the hands of a better creative team, an all-Annabelle film might have been a grand slam. Here it's a bloop single, narrowly avoiding a tag out on the basepaths.</Review>
            <Review>Annabelle, at its heart, feels like it should be part of an anthology collection, clocking in at twenty or thirty minutes, instead of at feature length.</Review>
            <Review>Annabelle's problems are legion but let's start with the bait-and-switch hook that promises a killer doll and instead delivers a shadowy gargoyle.</Review>
            <Review>We could chat all day about how "Annabelle" lifted (even stole) bits from better films. But, that would take away from the net effect of this evil doll movie. "Annabelle" is a very good horror film, originality be damned.</Review>
            <Review>Watching Annabelle is like watching a movie you've seen a dozen times before, just with different actors and slight variations on the same scare tactics.</Review>
            <Review>For much of its running time, Annabelle is so bereft of ideas for scare tactics that when the doll isn't involved, it's hard to differentiate it from any other domestic horror movie that's ever come out.</Review>

He began running with the wrong crowd and was soon fully immersed in a life of petty crime. The eldest son of two first generation Italian parents, Nick always felt the pressure to contribute to the family's American dream, especially once that dream stopped making ends meet. After his mother passed, his father (Paul Ben-Victor) refused to accept his help financially, even though it was needed to help support his younger brother Vitto (Kenny Wormald). Nick never gained acceptance from his father, who looked down on Nick for his lifestyle. (C) Millenium</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>Virgil First Raise wakes in a ditch on the hardscrabble plains of Montana, hungover and badly beaten. He sees a shocking vision: his father, ten years dead, lying frozen at his feet. Shaken, Virgil returns home to his ranch on the Reservation, only to find that his wife, Agnes, has left him. Worse, she's taken his beloved rifle. Virgil sets out to town find her- or perhaps just the gun- beginning a hi-line odyssey of inebriated and improbable intrigues with the mysterious Airplane Man, his beautiful accomplice, Malvina, and two dangerous Men in Suits. Virgil's quest also brings him face-to-face with childhood memories, traumas and visions of his long lost brother Mose. Virgil, bloodied and broken by his quest, realizes that he must look inward for the strength he needs to survive. In the mountains, he seeks out Yellow Calf- an old blind man, who helps him grasp the truth of his origins. By embracing- and no longer fleeing- his memories, Virgil is finally able to thaw the ice in his veins.(c) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>The Boxtrolls represents the best animated movie to reach theater screens since The Lego Movie exploded on the scene in February.</Review>
            <Review>There are many more delighted 'Ewwws' than too-easy 'Awws' in this charming, if a tad cynical, feature from the creators of Coraline and ParaNorman.</Review>
            <Review>It's a world that runs in a parallel universe akin to that of Charles Dickens, with creatively named characters involved in seemingly outlandish adventures in a Victorian-era city where a moral or two plays out in the end.</Review>
            <Review>It's a felt, funny, bracingly sincere kids' movie. And even more refreshing, it takes as a theme our social fixation with waste, salvage and repackaging.</Review>
            <Review>Without being didactic, "The Boxtrolls" presents the dangers of a hierarchical society, separated out into high-status and low, and also has some very interesting and moving things to say about identity, family, and morality.</Review>
            <Review>It's a wonderful world, full of Rube Goldberg contraptions below and colorful Dickensian squalor and excess above.</Review>
            <Review>The Boxtrolls is a thoroughly enjoyable movie that I already have plans to see a second time.</Review>
            <Review>By far its biggest downfall is the characters, they are simply not very appealing.</Review>
            <Review>Laika's technical implementation is exquisite, in what is their most complex undertaking yet.</Review>
            <Review>A delightful film that provides a kid-friendly story at the expense of dark realism.</Review>
            <Review>Stuffed full of quirky details, bizarre characters and cockeyed humour.</Review>
            <Review>In a weak year for feature-length animated films, "The Boxtrolls" was clearly the best in my estimation. That doesn't sound like much of a recommendation, but it truly is.</Review>

        <Duration>105</Duration>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>Contrived or not, the story is put across with pleasing, unpretentious conviction and skill by Macy.</Review>
            <Review>Rudderless is humane and almost entertaining.</Review>
            <Review>The film is a roller-coaster of emotions and the jolt, when it comes, will send you reeling.</Review>
            <Review>For all its noble intentions and loaded emotions, "Rudderless" proves a largely hollow, uninvolving affair.</Review>
            <Review>The story takes an even sharper left turn in the last half hour, raising emotional issues it can't adequately address.</Review>
            <Review>"Rudderless" isn't always smoothly paced, and features a plot twist that's awkwardly handled, but at its heart is a performance that resonates - and a director that, I hope, has more stories to tell.</Review>
            <Review>A lot of the emotional communication comes through in the music, especially when Sam cannot confront his own feelings, reminding us why we make music in the first place.</Review>
            <Review>Shock can lead to awe, but in the case of Rudderless, shock leads to "ahhh, they blew it."</Review>
            <Review>Skillfully directed by William H. Macy, "Rudderless" is one of those small independent films that it's a privilege to discover</Review>
            <Review>The picture is performance-driven, without a wandering eye, to the extent that you can't help but feel moved every time Billy Crudup's Sam busts out his guitar.</Review>
            <Review>Touching drama about father remembering lost son with music.</Review>
            <Review>Even though the screenplay strains credibility at times, and the music really isn't that great, the thoughtful premise is handled with sensitivity instead of crassness.</Review>

            <Review>Life's a Breeze spins a sitcom plot into passable yet predictable entertainment.</Review>
            <Review>As amiable and windswept as its title promises, for better or worse.</Review>
            <Review>A small sweet film, the sort of unexpected pleasure movie fans often find at a small film festival or on some second-tier cable channel.</Review>
            <Review>"Life's a Breeze" is a small film with a considerable amount of charm. Comic and idiosyncratic, it takes a warmhearted view toward its protagonists while still seeing them for exactly who they are.</Review>
            <Review>"Life's a Breeze" is ultimately about as cutting and memorable as its title.</Review>
            <Review>The film's surface naturalism and visual grit simply cover up a screenplay that's as full of crap as the average recent Hollywood comedy.</Review>
            <Review>Yes, if it wasn't for the salty language, this might just be a TV movie. But, I liked it.</Review>
            <Review>Despite the occasional emotional overtones, this is really a very light and enjoyable comedy.</Review>
            <Review>The mundane story is not much, but the likable characters are fun.</Review>
            <Review>Flanagan and appealing newcomer Kelly Thornton, as Nan's teenage granddaughter, deliver the only tolerable performances, probably because they don't say much, and like us, just observe the silliness on display.</Review>
            <Review>Set amidst long unemployment lines, Daly freshly finds the heart within the slapstick and social criticism when he focuses on the oldest and younger generations.</Review>
            <Review>A terrific Irish dramedy about clutter, family solidarity, and an 80-year-old woman's response to a major gift she is given.</Review>

        <Duration>107</Duration>

            <Review>Say this for Terry Gilliam: Even when he repeats himself, he's unique.</Review>
            <Review>Gives one the sense that the ex-Monty Python-ite thinks he's at a filmmaker version of the Last Chance Saloon, manufacturing and recycling as fast as he can.</Review>
            <Review>It's bursting with Gilliam's trademark manic energy, but the focus and execution are so soft that that energy ends up derailing the film instead of invigorating it.</Review>
            <Review>The culture's caught up to Gilliam. Everybody's doing Orwell now. But Gilliam's appropriation feels both aptly skeptical and unfashionably utopian.</Review>
            <Review>There is something so generous and so full-hearted in this profusion that to complain seems churlish, but "The Zero Theorem" has a bothersome ratio of misses to hits.</Review>
            <Review>This "Theorem" is all sizzle, zero steak.</Review>
            <Review>While it doesn't match his previous masterpieces, it frequently manages to recapture the anti-authoritarian spirit and whirling dervish quality of his best work.</Review>
            <Review>The ultimate irony of this film is that it revolves around the old thematic chestnut of pointless existence, yet ultimately finds little reason for its own.</Review>
            <Review>Little of this has any dramatic interest; it's full of bits of sour whimsy.</Review>
            <Review>Qohen and Bainsley are quirkily interesting though being little more than cyphers. And as in any Gilliam picture, there are some crazy flights of fancy, but this one is never grounded enough to come alive.</Review>
            <Review>Produced quickly on a slight budget, 'The Zero Theorem' devolves into a dead end that asks that old question: Is that all there is?</Review>
            <Review>Gilliam is reworking past preoccupations and the romance is pretty stale, but the mix of elements in this pop-eyed, Euro-corporate world keeps the film engaging. What also sustains The Zero Theorem is its lingering on solitude.</Review>

            <Review>let it grab you by the noodle and zap you into its whacked-out vision of human existence. You'll feel much better for it, I promise.</Review>
            <Review>Lucy is not about to win any prizes from Mensa ... but this isn't quite like any other blockbuster you'll see this year.</Review>
            <Review>No one has ever accused French action director Luc Besson of thinking too hard, and this frantic exercise in pseudoscience and goofball metaphysics is best enjoyed by following his lead.</Review>
            <Review>Part philosophical/scientific treatise, part action movie, a film that goes from mayhem to boredom in a heartbeat.</Review>
            <Review>Besson has made very, very bad films in the past, but this is the first time he has presented one so idiotic that the only way to properly convey its flaws is to enumerate them.</Review>
            <Review>Scarlett Johansson carries the film effortlessly, bridging Besson's narrative and logical ellipses by fully embracing his crowd-pleasing intentions and convincingly depicting Lucy's psychological transformation.</Review>
            <Review>It's a film that takes great delight in her essentially co-opting a long series of tropes and storylines typically reserved for men in stories of this type, which is an old trope in the feminist action movie wheelhouse.</Review>
            <Review>Throughout it all, Johansson is a cool and calm presence.</Review>
            <Review>Ms. Scarlett is mad appealing, capable and fierce. Lucy is no more illogical than any superhero movie you've ever seen, and an hour shorter.</Review>
            <Review>Say what you will about 'Lucy,' which is an absurdly silly and sometimes aggressively stupid movie, but it's at least interested in showing us something new.</Review>
            <Review>Prof. Norman (Freeman) says we use 10 percent of our brains. Dolphins, at 20 percent, evolved bio-sonar so sophisticated science can't match it. Watch Lucy evolve 100 percent.</Review>
            <Review>It's an antagonistically unintelligent piece, one that clearly views itself as equal parts entertaining and profound. It's neither.</Review>

        <Duration>82</Duration>
        <StoryLine>World for Ransom is an unofficial extension of the popular 1950s TV series China Smith. Most of the Smith personnel, including star Dan Duryea, director Robert Aldrich and cinematographer Joseph Biroc, are on hand for this inexpensive but well-mounted melodrama. Duryea plays a mercenary adventurer who gets mixed up in a scheme by foreign spies (who wear baggy suits and speak with Slavic accents) to kidnap a nuclear scientist. Actually it isn't the whole world that's held for ransom--only the city of Singapore, which the spies threaten with nuclear annihilation. World for Ransom star Dan Duryea is solidly supported by old pros Gene Lockhart, Patric Knowles, Reginald Denny and Nigel Bruce.</StoryLine>

            <Review>While The Pirates has its moments -- as when Yeo-wol and Jang bond late in the film -- little of it is compelling as comedy, drama or action. About the only thing The Pirates steal is time.</Review>
            <Review>It's a derivative trove of swashbuckling action, romance, comedy, special effects and revisionist history - the kind of film that would be pitched to studio execs as "Pirates of the Caribbean" meets "Free Willy."</Review>
            <Review>Neither the action nor the comedy in this action comedy is consistently strong.</Review>
            <Review>"Pirates" is fun, though with a running time of more than two hours, it's overlong. And too many of its battle scenes are too dimly lit.</Review>

            <Review>While it's a painless watch, "Wolves" looks comparatively bland as an adolescent male answer to Canada's last notable bigscreen werewolf effort, the femme-focused "Ginger Snaps" franchise.</Review>
            <Review>Swoopy-haired star Lucas Till makes for a credible young western-style hero, but even he's upended by the often silly, inconsistent story.</Review>
            <Review>The kind of pleasantly eccentric werewolf coming-of-age story that should be seen as the third-billed title in a horror movie marathon. When viewed on its own, one can't help but wonder who "Wolves"' was made for.</Review>
            <Review>Wolves limps along with a clunker of a script and unremarkable effects.</Review>
            <Review>As unoriginal as its title, David Hayter's "Wolves" is yet another hoary, hairy transformation narrative featuring lycanthropy as a metaphor for coming of age.</Review>
            <Review>The first 30 minutes of this cheap-looking monster drama are admittedly rough going. But once the "Twilight"-meets-"Sons of Anarchy" silliness kicks in, there's a lovable lunacy at work.</Review>
            <Review>There's modest fun to be had in this campy low-budget horror flick that ultimately doesn't have much bite.</Review>
            <Review>Forgettable werewolf flick is soapy and occasionally gory.</Review>
            <Review>This, as you've doubtless guessed, is all quite silly. And occasionally charming, too, in its wilfully old-fashioned way.</Review>
            <Review>A superhero-style origin story, only one that involves big, hairy, scary werewolves and some True Blood-style lunacy.</Review>
            <Review>It's loud and violent, but the feature drags more than it should, struggling with iffy performances and lousy visual effects to raise a properly furry screen commotion.</Review>
            <Review>Hayter burns through [his] shocking reveal early, giving his seldom funny, never scary fresh-faced horror-Western a listless quality, even at its slender runtime.</Review>

            <Review>As the narratives build toward their predictable conclusions, "Men, Women &amp; Children" seems wholly unaware that these various evils existed long before Facebook and Instagram.</Review>
            <Review>"Men, Women &amp; Children" is crowded with characters and subplots, a few of which resonate - but more often, an individual's story seems lost in the cyberflurry.</Review>
            <Review>It's like a collection of shared and traded Instagram posts. Revealing the telling moments of individual lives in snapshots leaves an itch to dig deeper.</Review>
            <Review>In trying to be a big, important movie, "Men, Women &amp; Children" is about none of the above.</Review>
            <Review>Men, Women &amp; Children attempts to achieve the tone of Reitman's early films, pirouetting between behavioral levity and dark melodrama, yet it often falls flat.</Review>
            <Review>The problem with Men, Women &amp; Children - and it's a big one - is that the movie isn't telling us anything we don't already know.</Review>
            <Review>The entire cast all turn in first-rate performances, as Reitman has given us a finely executed and fascinating cautionary tale that leaves lots of food for thought.</Review>
            <Review>It's the kind of movie where you wouldn't be surprised to discover Reitman and co- writer Erin Cressida Wilson were ticking the boxes on a literal checklist.</Review>
            <Review>(Writrer-Director) Reitman indicts our society, which has become not just wired but thoroughly trussed up. He comes down too hard, though, on the one character who is perceptive enough to see from the start where all this connectedness is heading.</Review>
            <Review>If Reitman's aim was to push buttons, make us think, and give his cast a stage for some stellar performances, he's succeeded wildly.</Review>
            <Review>It looks fantastic but adds nothing to the discussion of a post-9/11 world - Men, Women &amp; Children merely exploits it.</Review>
            <Review>The name of the film is "Men, Women &amp; Children." Don't forget the animals, because this one's a real dog.</Review>

            <Review>'Love is Strange' takes something so right and leaves it hanging all wrong.</Review>
            <Review>"Love Is Strange" is a testament to love, not in an overly sentimental way, but in a realistic way.</Review>
            <Review>"Love is Strange" boasts an abundance of patience and kindness - but not much of a pulse.</Review>
            <Review>Sachs rarely overstates his themes. "Love Is Strange" is largely a restrained drama about the loss of comfort.</Review>
            <Review>Love Is Strange is drab-looking and has its longueurs, but it's emotionally very full.</Review>
            <Review>I can't say enough about how smart and clear-eyed it is. And moving: I'm wiping tears off my keyboard as I type this.</Review>
            <Review>Yes, love is strange, but thank the heavens for that. In a world where lives are increasingly swayed by mortgages and job security, the nonsensical weirdness of love may be our only salvation.</Review>
            <Review>Pivoting on a loving couple growing older, not having finances in place, needing to rely on others to get by, Love Is Strange has universal poignancy.</Review>
            <Review>True to Sachs' style, the movie isn't designed as an actor's showcase. We're not supposed to notice the acting here -- just the people.</Review>
            <Review>John Lithgow and Alfred Molina... deliver wonderful performances as long-in-love older gents kept apart by the real estate market (a familiar story, and not just in New York, it seems).</Review>
            <Review>Pitch-perfect acting and a fine control of high emotion that never slips into treacly sentiment distinguish this small and lovely ensemble piece by writer-director Ira Sachs.</Review>
            <Review>Sachs understands [Lithgow and Molina's] consummate skills as actors; putting them together, the result is wonderfully warm and wise.</Review>

            <Review>"Young Ones" is a futuristic look at a world with little water, but the most barren thing in this Western-sci-fi flick is the character development.</Review>
            <Review>Young Ones has some interesting twists but falls short as a reworking of a classic Hollywood oater.</Review>
            <Review>Too bland to qualify as a really notable disaster, "Young Ones" finds young Paltrow still trying to find his voice.</Review>
            <Review>No matter how grim the future may be, it deserves a better movie in the here and now.</Review>
            <Review>The setting is futuristic, but the themes are ancient in "Young Ones," Jake Paltrow's eccentric merger of frontier western and science-fiction gadgetry.</Review>
            <Review>There's more than enough originality on display to wet the beaks of sci-fi and western fans alike.</Review>
            <Review>The problem is that the film is in perpetual fast-forward mode... speeding through all its flash and developments.</Review>
            <Review>An awkward, heady mixture of science-fiction, soap opera, western and Greek tragedy but the quality of the performances and the cinematography render it better than you might have feared.</Review>
            <Review>It's intermittently arresting but ultimately exasperating.</Review>
            <Review>There hasn't been as convincing a sci-fi dustbowl story since the original Mad Max.</Review>
            <Review>There are some intriguing concepts at play here, and a striking visual style amid the harsh arid landscapes, yet the slow-burning story boils down to simplistic elements of revenge that feel familiar.</Review>

In short, it's a journey of discovery, to find out the reasons behind the enormous spike in various forms of diabetes, over the last three decades, and what can be done about it. Oh...I get it another movie about how we eat too much and we're all going to die. Not really. Well, yes...as a culture we do certainly eat too much. But more importantly it's what we've been eating that may be the biggest problem. Refined and processed foods, especially processed carbohydrates have become a staple of our culture, and we are reaping the consequences. What makes Lathe and Eric experts on the topic? Nothing. They are not claiming to be experts in any way shape or form. They are filmmakers talking to a variety of experts in several fields who will present some very interesting data.(C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>For those who have ever nursed suspicions that the answer is "not enough," Honeymoon will inspire chills much more bone-deep than the ones provoked by, say, some poltergeist flinging around chairs.</Review>
            <Review>Leslie and Treadaway extract plenty of existential doubt and distressing emotion from what is essentially a claustrophobic two-hander.</Review>
            <Review>The gory final act can't help but be an explanatory letdown after so much enigmatic fizz, but that's little bother when the rest of Honeymoon delivers a steady dose of newlywed nightmare.</Review>
            <Review>I wish the film withheld more information from its audience to raise the overall tension but it's a solid genre pic, made so primarily by two entirely committed performances from its talented leads.</Review>
            <Review>A lean, low-budget debut that taps into newlywed anxiety with subtle wit and no small amount of style.</Review>
            <Review>Achieves emotional resonance due to how effectively it joins its source of horror with the stuff of everyday human anxieties.</Review>
            <Review>As a horror film, Honeymoon is a rare intellectual work.</Review>
            <Review>Honeymoon is a mature film, in which karma packs a real punch.</Review>
            <Review>...an atmospheric and occasionally frightening chiller that ultimately doesn't quite add up to much.</Review>
            <Review>Covers a lot of emotional and intellectual terrain for such an unassuming and modest indie horror film, and that's only part of what makes it so impressive.</Review>
            <Review>A skin-crawling thriller without compromise, "Honeymoon" is unpleasant, whip-smart and mesmerizing.</Review>
            <Review>Janiak does find a great deal of success turning that dreamy romance on its head, plunging her leads into a nightmarish scenario and ensuring you'll never forget what happened to them.</Review>

            <Review>The music is so terrible and it is such a focal point of the film that it was difficult to get past it.</Review>
            <Review>"The Identical" is ultimately too schematically sentimental, even with Liotta playing against type, to have much of an impact.</Review>
            <Review>Trading strictly in visual and narrative cliches, The Identical is so solemn and silly that at times you could swear it was a lampoon.</Review>
            <Review>While it's not a dull time, working within a fictional construct it lacks the depth to really make this come alive.</Review>

            <Review>Frank's film is much more of a noir outing than a straight action feature, and Neeson slips right into the tone and feel of the hard-boiled detective offering.</Review>
            <Review>As a throwback to a type of nasty, ugly crime film of yesteryear, A Walk Among the Tombstones cleans up.</Review>
            <Review>As nauseating as the film's inventive sadisms can be, Frank succeeds far more in the details than in the larger picture that tries to relate this world to ours.</Review>
            <Review>While we're waiting for the release of Taken 3, the man who was Oskar Schindler is keeping us in an action hero frame of mind with the moody-but-essentially-empty A Walk Among the Tombstones.</Review>

            <Review>If this is your kind of movie, it's hard to find one better made.</Review>
            <Review>There are nice moments of humour and the nostalgic 1990s feel, the change in technology and the shadow of Y2K works well even if it makes some of us feel our age.</Review>
            <Review>Audiences are likely to oscillate wildly between boredom and repulsion, with only Neeson enthusiasts finding anything to embrace.</Review>

            <Review>"Jessabelle" is interesting in some of the small details, and in its strong sense of the Louisiana bayou atmosphere, and then it completely falls apart when it starts being a horror film.</Review>

        <Duration>84</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Peaceful, rustic Metzburgh is a quiet village which was a former industrial town whose glory days are long past after the collapse of Metzburgh Grain. Teenager Mark Lowe (Jason John Beebe) and his ex-girlfriend Lucy Greenheart (Sarah Manzella) are stuck in a lovers quarrel when a meteorite crash lands in the passive community. Glen (Robert Bozek ), an ex-employee of the grain silos who became homeless after the collapse of the mills, stumbles upon the fiery crash. Unaware that his find could be dangerous, he gets too close and a chemical poison sprays out of the meteorite, enveloping him. The chemical agent known as Ombis begins to turn his insides into a slimly substance. Unable to stop the spread of the infection, Glen runs onto the road where Mark and Lucy find him. The two take him to the only Doctor in town, Doctor D (Deborah Manzella) . Mark and Lucy are shocked by their gruesome discovery and immediately contact the local Sheriff Thomas Brackett (Richard Satterwhite) who is on a date with a lovely waitress Daisy (Kathy Murphy). With their date being interrupted, they aid the traumatized love birds. With no sign of the creature or its victims, Brackett dismisses Mark's fantastic story. Quickly returning to where the meteorite crash landed, Mark finds a new horrific discovery that the meteorite wasn't the only creature to crash land on Earth. With the towns folk overrun by the virus and the collateral damage adding up, a special containment team shows up to try and keep order and contain the plague. The human struggle of the residents of Metzburgh and their fight for survival then begins as the village is overrun with the alien invasion and the mutated humans that it creates.</StoryLine>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>[Hossein Amini's] polished storytelling carries this along, generally compensating for the mundane visuals and the actors' skilled but unmoored performances.</Review>
            <Review>At a certain point, it's akin to reading a mediocre murder mystery. You finish it because you're too far in to quit, as opposed to actually caring how things wrap up.</Review>
            <Review>What the movie lacks in suspense, it could make up for with erotic tension. That's missing, too.</Review>
            <Review>Everything about The Two Faces of January is right, even as the events it describes - a couple's idyllic Grecian holiday, a charming American's adventures abroad - go terribly wrong.</Review>
            <Review>The movie never reaches a boil. Instead, it simmers and simmers until you're suddenly shocked at the hot water you're in.</Review>
            <Review>Things get awfully twisted under that hot Mediterranean sun.</Review>
            <Review>It's a classy looking movie for sure, and as pleasant a travelogue as Ripley was in its day. But Highsmith's psychological edge is absent for much of this and its shade of noir has suffered a serious bleaching in all that Mediterranean sun.</Review>
            <Review>A handsome thriller with plot twists that don't always make sense, "The Two Faces of January," moves slowly, but ultimately entertains.</Review>
            <Review>A perfectly ordinary, unexceptionally satisfactory film... does a fine job with the mechanics of the plot, but it whiffs a bit on the characters.</Review>
            <Review>This is a well-written and well-acted movie. The relationships in the triangle at the center of the film are not easily made convincing, but excellent acting makes it work. This is a very solid thriller with a lot of compelling emotional complexity.</Review>
            <Review>Rather than rise, this story cools off, fading away into unconvincing, accidental tragedy and an attempted emotional coda that feels more stapled on than woven in.</Review>
            <Review>Despite admirable moment-to-moment feats of actorly legerdemain from the primary and secondary cast alike, there's a deadly lack of heat. The costumes sing, the cigarettes fume. The simmer satisfies but never earns the tale's godless gloom.</Review>

            <Review>Bad Turn Worse is a taut noir tale, bolstered by a trio of excellent lead performances and a well-plotted script.</Review>
            <Review>Directors Zeke and Simon Hawkins add air-quote references to Jim Thompson, Steven Soderbergh, and the Coen brothers but are too proud of the movie's twists to make them truly snap.</Review>
            <Review>It's a confident, engaging film, undone by some narrative sag in the middle but worth seeing for its opening and closing acts.</Review>
            <Review>"Bad Turn Worse" simply peters out by the night of the big heist, never achieving more than being imitative of small-town noir instead of getting inside it.</Review>
            <Review>A juicy neo-noir like "Bad Turn Worse" doesn't have to make total sense to grab you. All it has to do is spit like a snake enough times to show that it means business.</Review>
            <Review>This cowboy noir works fine as a genre riff, but screenwriter Dutch Southern draws so liberally on the work of Jim Thompson, Cormac McCarthy, and the Coen brothers that he ought to take them all out for drinks.</Review>
            <Review>A taut thriller with assured performances from its central core, the film eventually finds itself exactly where logic would expect it to be.</Review>
            <Review>It has a humid sense of place, a few effective twists, and most importantly a terrific primary villain.</Review>
            <Review>The brothers take a lean screenplay and turn it into a memorable thrill ride.</Review>
            <Review>Entertaining pulp.</Review>
            <Review>Another super-solid indie thriller along the lines of Blue Ruin &amp; Cold in July. Highly recommended.</Review>
            <Review>Bad Turn Worse isn't bad, it's simply generic, but it owns its genre with such swagger one can't help but look forward to seeing these actors, directors and writer in action again.</Review>

        <Duration>84</Duration>
        <StoryLine>In MEMPHIS, a strange singer with 'god given talent' drifts through the mythic city of Memphis under its canopy of ancient oak trees, shattered windows, and burning spirituality. Surrounded by lovers, legends, hustlers, preachers, and a wolfpack of kids, the unstable performer avoids the recording studio and is driven to spend time in his own form of self-discovery. Shown in fragments, his journey drags him from love and happiness right to the edge of another dimension. Featuring an explosive performance and score from the singular recording artist-come-wizard, Willis Earl Beal, MEMPHIS is a film steeped in folklore, music, surrealism, and the abstract search for glory.

            <Review>The film feels like a sketch rather than a portrait, beautifully rendered but incomplete in the details.</Review>
            <Review>The film is less than 80 minutes and if you cut the shots that go on too long it would be less than an hour.</Review>
            <Review>Tim Sutton's second feature, starring the young contemporary musician Willis Earl Beal as a musician with the same name, captures the mood of the blues with pitch-perfect sensuality.</Review>
            <Review>"Memphis" is a gorgeous, gorgeous movie-the kind that prompts critics to say "every frame could be a painting"-but it is also proof that the woozy, opaque mode of American independent filmmaking has its limits.</Review>
            <Review>There's a self-awareness to both Sutton's direction and Willis' performance that deflates some of the potential pretentiousness from the proceedings.</Review>
            <Review>Beal is an excellent choice of lead, managing to hold the viewer's attention without ever coming across as so charismatic or dynamic that we question Willie's lack of success.</Review>
            <Review>...drifts between the earthy and the celestial, with a scratchily sublime soundtrack to match.</Review>
            <Review>Its metabolism may be unfamiliar, but this extraordinary movie has true rhythm, and true life.</Review>
            <Review>'I created this,' Beal says early in the film. 'I imagined it into existence.' The words could be a manifesto for filmmakers, an articulation of the director's mission, particularly in the case of as singular a work as 'Memphis.'</Review>

        <StoryLine>In the vein of crime classics like MEAN STREETS and INFERNAL AFFAIRS, REVENGE OF THE GREEN DRAGONS follows two immigrant brothers Sonny (Justin Chon) and Steven (Kevin Wu) who survive the impoverished despair of New York in the 1980s by joining Chinatown gang "The Green Dragons". The brothers quickly rise up the ranks, drawing the unwanted attention of hard-boiled city cops. After an ill- fated love affair pits Sonny against his own brother, he sets out for revenge on the very gang who made him who he is. From acclaimed Director Andrew Lau and Andrew Loo, and legendary Executive Producer Martin Scorsese comes a brilliant mix between a Hong Kong action film and a New York City crime thriller, portraying the never-before-told true story of "The Green Dragons".

            <Review>The representation of Asian American men as hot-blooded toughies in the film does put a dent in the omnipresent nerdy eunuch stereotype and the model-minority myth.</Review>
            <Review>There's a good story somewhere in "Revenge of the Green Dragons," but it's not the one Lau and his colleagues chose to retell.</Review>
            <Review>This crudely made thriller plays like a stilted Cantonese riff on organized-crime cliches, substituting blood and brutality for novelty or insight.</Review>
            <Review>This crime drama wants to be a Chinese-American "Goodfellas," but it ends up just looking bad.</Review>
            <Review>What initially feels like brash energy peters out until what's left mainly evokes pretty ordinary gangster movies.</Review>
            <Review>[A] generic, nondescript gangster saga.</Review>
            <Review>Revenge boasts Martin Scorsese as an executive producer (and it really does boast - Scorsese's is the first name we see), but the cliché-ridden narrative and patchy acting prevent the film from being Chinatown's answer to Goodfellas.</Review>
            <Review>The self-inflating tale of two immigrant brothers, who join a Chinatown gang as kids, falls woefully short of significance, despite being executive produced by Martin Scorsese.</Review>
            <Review>It doesn't bring anything new to the table. And its pacing, grim tone, and cheesy guitar riffs belong squarely in the '80s.</Review>
            <Review>Violent, generic, not awful, but nothing more than that.</Review>
            <Review>Vicious '80s gangs fight in graphically violent drama.</Review>
            <Review>An ugly, dispiriting mess, full of clichés, bad taste and bombast.</Review>

            <Review>This is a nutty film, and for the most part I mean that in a good way.</Review>
            <Review>Gone Girl promises to be an unnerving portrait of marriage as ruin, but then it opts for madness and implausibility.</Review>
            <Review>This is the most elegant, exquisitely made trash.</Review>
            <Review>Fincher is as Fincher does. And what Fincher does better than almost anyone is create moody, meticulously crafted thrillers that straddle the divide between genre and art.</Review>
            <Review>Gone Girl is a sick movie, but it's a lumbering, anti-imaginative kind of sick.</Review>
            <Review>In the film's final stages [Fincher] seems to be relying entirely on craft - but, boy, is it effective craft.</Review>
            <Review>Is Fincher himself sexist? No. I don't think so. Could Gone Girl appeal to and feed a growing tendency in society to justify the idea of women as threat? Absolutely.</Review>
            <Review>Novelist Flynn nicely adapts her book to the screen, remaining predominately faithful to her source material.</Review>
            <Review>The latest effort by director David Fincher to suss out the meaning of modern American life.</Review>
            <Review>'Gone Girl' may come advertised as a thriller, but that's Fincher being a trickster-he's gone and made the curtest, nastiest, most acidic black comedy about the marital accord since 'The War of the Roses.'</Review>
            <Review>A dark warning against the cost of domestic bliss, is perhaps a perfect date movie for happy or unhappy couples, since the film's extreme satire takes cover under the sharp, highly engaging narrative and storytelling heft.</Review>
            <Review>Simply brilliant. Highly recommended! [Full review in Spanish]</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>A hip-looking mess of a movie, made tolerable by Benjamin's spacey-cool Hendrix. Great costumes, few insights.</Review>
            <Review>It's a risky approach that's bound to frustrate many folks, but it's also quite illuminating in its own way.</Review>
            <Review>You can sense the movie's desire to break free of the demands of the rock biopic, but you can also sense it constantly being pulled back.</Review>
            <Review>Thanks to Benjamin's performance and the unique quality of the subject itself, the movie's hard to dismiss.</Review>
            <Review>A flawed, ambitious and deeply peculiar portrait of one of the 20th century's most enigmatic musical talents, in the year before he ascended to rock-god status, that resembles no other pop-music biopic you've ever seen.</Review>
            <Review>Benjamin captures Hendrix's nodding swagger, his effortless cool, and most important, his voice - going beyond mimicry into some other, spookier realm.</Review>
            <Review>All these things-aesthetic, composition, acting-ultimately end up secondary when compared to the dynamic performance at the film's center.</Review>
            <Review>Against all odds, John Ridley has assembled the ideal team to tackle an exceedingly ambitious project, one that bears fruit at nearly every turn.</Review>
            <Review>... an interesting curiosity that takes chances and gets at a certain truth about its enigmatic lead character.</Review>
            <Review>[A] disjointed and clumsily made biopic of rock icon Jimi Hendrix.</Review>
            <Review>André Benjamin does a fair job of conveying Hendrix's languid charisma and grace... But the soapy drama remains about as convincing as the troop of rock lookalikes who file past at intervals.</Review>
            <Review>Andre 3000 makes an A-grade Hendrix, but this biopic sees the legend's legacy fall into a bit of a haze.</Review>

            <Review>A film remarkably true to life's haphazard rhythms.</Review>
            <Review>Made by a black American woman, about a black American woman, it's a study of a culture where the matriarchs are strong by necessity and trapped by circumstance - adrift in the middle of nowhere.</Review>
            <Review>[A] hushed, tenderly observant drama about a young woman trying to do right by herself and her marriage while her husband is in prison.</Review>
            <Review>This is a tough-minded story of change that happens in almost imperceptibly tiny increments - as true growth so often does in reality.</Review>
            <Review>This film is about a particular African-American experience, true, but it's also about the human experience. It will haunt you. It should.</Review>
            <Review>A sluggish enterprise, not measured or languorous or full of detail, but plodding, with scenes that run too long and others that are unnecessary.</Review>
            <Review>Before directing Selma, Ava Duverny made Middle of Nowhere (2012), a small story about a woman who put her aspirations on hold when her husband goes to prison.</Review>
            <Review>I should love this movie, but something about it kept me at arm's length.</Review>
            <Review>Burrows deep into a lower working-class, primarily female African-American milieu and culture rarely presented onscreen with any sort of realism or understanding.</Review>
            <Review>This isn't about dramatic revelations and charge confrontations. DuVernay, who also wrote the original screenplay, has made a film about those moments lived between the decisions...</Review>
            <Review>DuVernay uses this situation as a light but poignant metaphor for Ruby's personal growth, as she finds a way to escape her own kind of prison.</Review>
            <Review>Though writer-director Ava DuVernay avoids any and all cliché right up until the closing titles, I have no qualms ending this review with one: I wholeheartedly look forward to her next project.</Review>

            <Review>"Finding Fela!" is an apt title for this dynamic and thorough documentary by Alex Gibney.</Review>
            <Review>At its best, the film manages the trick of constructing a modern myth while simultaneously deconstructing it - on one level, this is a story about how to tell a story. Plus, it's got a great beat and you can dance to it.</Review>
            <Review>The constant flipping between stagecraft and reality creates a dissonant static that prevents any satisfying connection with the film.</Review>
            <Review>The early songs are a celebration; the later music is a weapon. It would be nice to get more of both, but for that there are the reissued CDs, not to mention this film's soundtrack, a decent sampler.</Review>
            <Review>For all his strangeness, Fela had a captivating side, and his music could be riveting. That's why the film disappoints - a movie about such a man as this ought to be more exciting.</Review>
            <Review>A fine introduction to a fascinating African musician</Review>
            <Review>It is the man himself that will draw you into this film, even if you are not a fan of musical documentaries.</Review>
            <Review>Fela Kuti was a one-in-a-million figure with indomitable presence. What film could possibly contain him?</Review>
            <Review>The wild life, risky art and radical politics of an African revolutionary receive generally entertaining if inappropriately conventional treatment in this documentary...</Review>
            <Review>Leaves you tapping your feet and scratching your head about why such a rich story didn't generate a better, deeper, smarter movie.</Review>
            <Review>Gibney unearths a wealth of archive footage that reaffirms Kuti's superstar status, and watches as Jones wrestles with the contradictions that made the musician such a troublesome icon - confronting some, sidestepping others.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>92</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Sitting in an empty theater, a film archivist watches the grainy footage that will be his undoing. David and his wife are perfectly happy-or so he believes. When he finds out the home he shares with his wife and son was the scene of a ghastly turn-of-the-century murder, David dismisses it as ancient history. That is, until the sinister history ripples into the present and casts a shadow over life as he knows it. And when a looming secret shatters his marriage, David can't help but suspect the dark spirits of the house are somehow involved. In his drive to unveil the shadows hidden in the walls, David begins to descend into insanity, threatening the lives of everyone around him. Through ghastly imagery and a chilling score, Ivan Kavanagh's The Canal is an Irish ghost story that will leave you with a fear of the dark and a dripping chill down your spine long after the film's conclusion.

            <Review>Injecting explicit imagery into an old-fashioned possession story, writer-director Ivan Kavanagh brandishes his unusual mix of styles right from the beginning.</Review>
            <Review>Over all, the action is too cryptic, and the pedestrian dialogue doesn't help.</Review>

            <Review>A wonderfully shot, cleverly written, and subtly effective horror movie.</Review>
            <Review>The Canal, though reliant on atmospherics and superb sound design, looks and feels more than genre cinema than Kavanagh's earlier, freakier one.</Review>
            <Review>Making the most of its modest attributes and a wrenching central performance by TV regular and Hellboy veteran Rupert Evans, this Irish chiller lurches from unspoken eeriness to outright horror as it plots a familiar paranormal trajectory.</Review>

            <Review>People are just like birds, this French drama asserts-over and over again, with mind-numbing obviousness, until you might feel like spreading your wings and flying away yourself.</Review>
            <Review>An airport hotel may not seem the most inspiring of locations for a story of life-changing consequence, but French filmmaker Pascale Ferran's delicate, compassionate "Bird People" is just that sort of risk-taking existential adventure.</Review>
            <Review>The vehicle for the message feels haphazard, as if Ferran were trying to create a patchwork of various film types rather than one cohesive piece.</Review>
            <Review>Bird People has ideas about nature, human and otherwise. It's got a sense of romantic wonder.</Review>
            <Review>An artful experiment that only half works.</Review>
            <Review>Ferran is prone to "flights of fancy," pardon the pun, as some scenes in his film go on unchecked while others aren't allowed nearly the right amount of time to develop.</Review>
            <Review>Bird People is one of those rare opportunities to see something different and exceptional. [full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>The premise sounds interesting, but it suffers from a lack of cohesiveness. [full review in Spanish]</Review>

        <Duration>79</Duration>
        <StoryLine>It's been said that the first 21 years defines the career of an artist. Few directors have single-handedly shaken up the film establishment like the godfather of indie, Richard Linklater. From the groundbreaking SLACKER to his innovative BOYHOOD, Linklater has reached the 21-year mark and has unapologetically carved his signature into American pop culture. Get a raw and honest perspective on Richard through candid conversations with Ethan Hawke, Jack Black, Keanu Reeves, Billy Bob Thornton, Matthew McConaughey, Jason Reitman, Julie Delpy and others, and see their stories brought to life through hilarious animated sequences. For a man who became famous for celebrating the cool and casual, Linklater emerges as a surprisingly strategic and visionary director who has already established a legacy and perfected a style that can't be denied.

            <Review>An amiable but wholly unnecessary movie that plays like a feature-length version of those reels one watches while eating rubbery chicken at a banquet honoring a much-loved artist.</Review>
            <Review>Feels slapped together, something you'd see at an awards dinner, save for the dippy cartoon segments, which considering the subject's creative use of animation ("A Scanner Darkly"), undercut every anecdotal stab at thoughtful analysis.</Review>
            <Review>The luminaries in "21" pay deserving tribute to Mr. Linklater. Soon, perhaps, so will the Academy.</Review>
            <Review>"21 Years: Richard Linklater" makes for a disappointingly hollow hagiography: gushy, superficial and strangely overdue - arriving significantly later than its title prescribes.</Review>
            <Review>There are great clips and good insight, and it's all as loose and cool as an Austin night out.</Review>
            <Review>There's a certain satisfaction in a rundown of a career as rich and varied as Linklater's, not unlike the pleasure of watching a well-edited Oscar tribute reel.</Review>
            <Review>The resulting tribute may be a puff piece, but it's also informative and often entertaining.</Review>
            <Review>The massively frustrating 21 Years: Richard Linklater is a perfect example of the difference between a great subject and a great (or even a good) documentary.</Review>
            <Review>The film's working premise -- that the first 21 years of an artist's career define his career -- is an artificial self-imposition. But Dunaway and Wood toss out that analytic structure from the start.</Review>
            <Review>A total puff piece, unapologetically so ... playing to the casualness of its director's films, a collection of people having and being a lot of fun.</Review>
            <Review>Every word spoken would feel right at home in an electronic press kit.</Review>
            <Review>21 Years: Richard Linklater is a puff piece about the American indie film titan that lacks the insight and analysis necessary to make it a strong retrospective of a great artist.</Review>

        <StoryLine>To all appearances, May Brennan (Cherien Dabis) has it all -- intelligent, gorgeous, the recipient of raves for her recently published book and set to marry her loving fianc� Ziad (Alexander Siddig), a distinguished New York scholar. But immediately upon returning to her familial hometown of Amman, Jordan for the wedding, the cracks in her seemingly perfect life begin to show. May's headstrong, born-again Christian mother Nadine (Hiam Abbass) disapproves of Ziad's Muslim faith and is firm in her decision to not attend the ceremony. Her sisters Dalia (Alia Shawkat) and Yasmine (Nadine Malouf) revert to behaving like rebellious teenagers as their estranged father Edward (Bill Pullman) awkwardly attempts to make amends. Confronted with the wounds of her parent's long-broken relationship, coupled with the unavoidable clash of old-world and modern values, May is lead to question the direction her life is taking. Her once carefully structured world appears to unravel as she grapples with her own truths in this fresh, exotic look at a woman caught in the crossroads between tradition and choice.

        <StoryLine>A real adventure film - for the 21st century. On a three-mast schooner packed with artists, scientists and ambitions worthy of Noah or Columbus, we set off for the end of the world: the rapidly melting massifs of North-East Greenland. An epic journey where the brave sailors on board encounter polar bear nightmares, Stone Age playgrounds and entirely new species. But in their encounter with new, unknown parts of the world, the crew of scientist and artists also confronted the existential questions of life. Curiosity, grand pathos and a liberating dose of humour come together in a superbly orchestrated film where one iconic image after the other seduces us far beyond the historical footnote that is humanity. A film conceived and brought to life on a grand scale - a long forgotten childhood dream lived out by grown artists and scientists. (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>It might not be quite the "adventure film" that the press materials promise, but it's a diverting enough variation on familiar environmental-crisis studies.</Review>
            <Review>Dencik's travelogue reveals a journey with curious traces of the past, eye-popping encounters with a wild present and ... a weighted reminder of our future as stewards of the Earth.</Review>
            <Review>The movie reveals some of the most stunning landscape cinematography imaginable, while everyone on the isolated ship waxes philosophical - as who would not?</Review>
            <Review>All on board are curiously resigned to mankind's death by environment, and take the long view that another life form will one day take our place.</Review>
            <Review>"Expedition" is like a stoned camping trip to an unimaginably distant location, where your companions are a group of brilliant intellectuals, artists and scientists.</Review>
            <Review>[A] playful but ominously open-ended documentary about a motley crew of Danes headed to Greenland on a schooner.</Review>
            <Review>The reassuring note that comes at the end of the journey isn't quite its thesis and, like the film, offers up no easy answers in spite of its search.</Review>

            <Review>Breathtaking scenery and interesting choices of music, but too aimless and formless. You can't help but wonder what Werner Herzog would've done with it.</Review>
            <Review>Equally contemplative and tumultuous, 'Expedition to the End of the World' is a beautifully shot and thoughtfully constructed journey up to Greenland and into a post climate change future.</Review>
            <Review>The tone isn't alarmist, but full of curiosity and perspective, no doubt rooted in the rare privilege of being in this spectacularly beautiful place.</Review>

            <Review>The silly, square and charming Bollywood superhero picture Krrish 3 measures up pretty well, provided you bear in mind that it's more of a kids' movie than its U.S. counterparts.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is devoid of that one secret ingredient that makes audiences love superhero films: It just isn't cool.</Review>
            <Review>Filmmaker Rakesh Roshan deserves a round of applause for giving us a homegrown superhero. Krrish 3 is ambitious and exciting. Sadly, it's also derivative, clumsy, convoluted and far too long.</Review>
            <Review>Director Rakesh Roshan distinctly veers away from the dark ennui of recent Hollywood superhero films and opts instead for a film of good but gentle fun.</Review>
            <Review>A tighter third act would have helped, with one too many teary farewells and resurrected bad-guys bulking up the finale. Naturally, such issues won't bother the under-12s, for whom this old-fashioned, energetic matinee malarkey is clearly aimed.</Review>
            <Review>A highly enjoyable Bollywood-take on the superhero action genre, with a hefty dose of wushu-style wirework added in.</Review>
            <Review>Hrithik is truly the stuff superheroes are made of.</Review>
            <Review>Each scene has you hooked and it moves seamlessly at a brisk pace.</Review>
            <Review>It's the action that matches up to the scale of Hollywood films and keeps you entertained.</Review>
            <Review>Superheroes have been around in Hindi cinema for decades, but huge technology jumps have made Krrish 3 the slickest of them all, special effects-wise. The rest of it is marred by tackiness.</Review>
            <Review>Unfortunately to find these interesting themes, you have to dig through a morass of conventional Bollywood drivel.</Review>
            <Review>It's a Diwali bonanza for moviegoers across the globe and is sure to conclude the celebratory period on a high.</Review>

            <Review>Exciting action partly compensates for the lack of scripting and thesping panache.</Review>
            <Review>When I walk into a film called Agent Vinod, what I want, more than anything else, is an adrenalin rush... The plot plods along, especially in the first half.</Review>
            <Review>The middle section drags, and there is a full hour in this film that could easily be edited out.</Review>
            <Review>Shot in St Petersburg, Morocco, Riga, Somalia, Karachi, Delhi and London, Khan and Kapoor can console themselves with the fact that, while they won't set the box office on fire, they would have certainly clocked up a lot of free air miles.</Review>
            <Review>By the time the post-interval action finale revs up, there is very little viewer investment in plot or character, resulting in a hollow showiness that overstays its usefulness.</Review>
            <Review>Works more often than not, and when it does, sometimes spectacularly.</Review>
            <Review>Well worth watching.</Review>
            <Review>Agent Vinod is smartly put together and works because of Saif.</Review>
            <Review>It is unclear where Agent Vinod is coming from. You can see the Bond-Bourne-Ludlum influences, but not the unfettered play of Sriram Raghavan's wit and intelligence.</Review>
            <Review>While the basics make sure that Agent Vinod is way better than run-of-the-mill Bollywood, our standards for Sriram Raghavan are sky high.</Review>
            <Review>Agent Vinod is slick and visually stylized, but loses steam at times. The movie is a tad long and often creatively compromised -- for style over substance.</Review>

Laying the peddle to the metal, off-duty paramedic Steve races the dying man and his desperate daughter to the hospital, only to be redirected to an evacuation center on the outskirts of town. Rushing in, the trio finds the frantic staff overwhelmed by a staggering number of dead bodies. Just as her father receives a massive dose of adrenaline, Sarah falls unconscious. She's about to drift out of one nightmare and into a waking-terror beyond her wildest fears. Waking up to find the hospital corridors darkened and silent, Sarah soon comes face to face with the living dead, and begins her epic struggle for survival in a strange new world. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>One of the many pleasures of director Adam Wingard's tough, fun thriller "The Guest" is seeing Matthew Crawley -- er, British actor Dan Stevens -- serve up a mesmerizing star turn of psycho charm.</Review>
            <Review>A slow-burn approach seems to pose a challenging change-up for the filmmakers, who struggle to build tension as the second acts stretches well past the point when the level of menace should be escalating.</Review>
            <Review>Wickedly entertaining.</Review>
            <Review>It's not a particularly brilliant conceit, but, not unlike Stevens's beautifully one-note performance, it's evocative nevertheless -- lending the whole movie an aura of pop inevitability, turning its blunt predictability into something of a virtue.</Review>
            <Review>The Guest borrows from other genre pictures with such intelligence and clarity of purpose, it manages to feel fresh, exciting.</Review>
            <Review>The pleasures of The Guest lie mainly in anticipating how the next expected corner will be turned.</Review>
            <Review>The Guest makes a strong case for Wingard as our next great action director.</Review>
            <Review>The kind of immediate pop artifact that's sure to keep many veteran filmmakers awake at night.</Review>
            <Review>If The Guest were a colour it would be the neon blue of its title card: a little bit show-off, a little bit retro, but it'll definitely brighten your night.</Review>
            <Review>...[Dan Stevens] plays wholesome, aloof, seductive, dangerous, psychotic... He nails every single beat.</Review>
            <Review>Barrett and Wingard are more about exploring the wish-fulfillment than getting into any deep psychological warfare. Still, the screenplay knows just when to create more menace and move on, and it escalates the craziness right up to the breaking point.</Review>
            <Review>This 1980s-style movie has wickedly pleasing aplomb. As fantasy escapism, it's brave, colorful and entertaining for audiences who can handle substantial carnage.</Review>

            <Review>This labor-of-love portrait of those who labor in the dirt for love of dinosaurs is also a chronicle of the ways in which the modern legal system can threaten the preservation of even prehistory.</Review>
            <Review>Any documentary can be slanted to a particular point of view, but most filmmakers try to be a bit more subtle. Cry me a river, "Dinosaur 13."</Review>
            <Review>Even if the filmmaking is one-sided, the story is more compelling than it sounds.</Review>
            <Review>We see much of both sides in Dinosaur 13.</Review>
            <Review>After a promising half-hour or so, "Dinosaur 13" becomes less convincing and less involving, particularly as the real-life narrative peaks halfway through.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>Calling it a sum of its parts can be a backhanded compliment, but it feels like especially worthy praise for Boyhood, considering how much went into making it feel whole.</Review>
            <Review>We can quibble with small stuff in Boyhood. Supporting performances are variable, the sister drops out as a dramatic character ... I could go on. But the cumulative power is tremendous.</Review>
            <Review>While everything about Boyhood is done with extraordinary care, the master stroke was clearly the casting, 13 years ago, of a little Texas boy named Ellar Coltrane.</Review>
            <Review>It's like a time-lapse photo of an expanding consciousness.</Review>
            <Review>A word about the film's epic length. Boyhood is 166 minutes long. Yet it is so affecting, so much a thing of wonder, that it could run forever and I would still keep watching.</Review>
            <Review>Linklater's casual hand at storytelling, dealing out reel after reel of naggingly forthright enlightenment, turns this simple tale of a mother trying to do her best into something worth every second of the time it took to produce.</Review>
            <Review>A film 12 years in the making and worth every minute of the wait.</Review>
            <Review>'Boyhood' reveals itself as something deeper, more noteworthy and ambitious than even its remarkable production would suggest, for Linklater has given us nothing less than a cinematic approximation of human memory.</Review>
            <Review>'Boyhood' is to coming-of-age movies what 'Act of Valor' is to war movies. 'Valor' used active-duty Navy SEALs, and 'Boyhood' films the same boy over a period of 12 years.</Review>
            <Review>Honestly, Boyhood is Richard Linklater's masterpiece and easily the best film of the year so far. Do not miss it.</Review>
            <Review>It is sure to be one of the best films of my year.</Review>
            <Review>Boyhood is a cinematic achievement. The least we can do is see it and live the experience. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>

            <Review>Chadwick Boseman gives a startling and galvanic performance.</Review>
            <Review>In Boseman's hands - and his feet, and his entire body, for that matter - he demands and earns our attention.</Review>
            <Review>Somewhat sanitized and over-directed biopic saved by Boseman's electric performance.</Review>
            <Review>Though "Get On Up" never congeals into a satisfactory whole, its fragmentary portrait of the singer at the height of his fame - intercut with his troubled single-parent childhood - effectively shows his invasive power in popular culture.</Review>
            <Review>More often, the film skates along the surface of Brown's contradictory character. Now if it skated like Brown's dance moves glided onstage, that really would have been something.</Review>
            <Review>The storytelling is mostly linear, with some confusing back-and-forth in the chronology, and it's a long slog. The Brown who emerges from this film has a monstrous ego to go with his monster talent.</Review>
            <Review>The narrative is unsatisfying as it leaves lots of unanswered questions.</Review>
            <Review>As prodigious a talent as Prince was, he only altered the funk. The megalithic, trail-blazing talent of James Brown birthed it. And Chadwick Boseman nails the telling of it.</Review>
            <Review>Musically explosive, emotionally powerful and flat-out funky, Get on Up tells the outrageous life story of James Brown with a quirky brilliance worthy of the man at its center.</Review>
            <Review>Worthy of its subject and the dollars of music and film fans alike. As roundly entertaining as any biopic in recent memory.</Review>
            <Review>Boseman is the highlight, of course, and Taylor is smart to keep his leading man front-and-center in every, single scene.</Review>
            <Review>The screenplay from Jez and John-Henry Butterworth inserts some actual discussion of his songwriting and groove technique, giving the man credit for virtually inventing the funk.</Review>

            <Review>Rand's parable is meant to showcase just how much our world needs the best of us, but this adaptation only does so accidentally -- by revealing what movies would be like if none of the best of us worked on them.</Review>
            <Review>A missed opportunity to speak to anyone other than the converted, but at least as the culmination of its makers' will.</Review>
            <Review>To find fault with the Atlas Shrugged franchise because of its politics is like complaining about Birdemic because it gets the ornithology wrong. Why dwell on the details when there are giant, embarrassing flaws staring you in the face?</Review>
            <Review>We get it, we get it: Capitalism is good, government is bad. But "Atlas Shrugged: Who Is John Galt?" is worse.</Review>
            <Review>In 1949, when Warner Bros. filmed The Fountainhead, Rand threatened to burn down the studio if they compromised her novel. I'd like to think that if she were alive she'd be looking for lighter fluid for this one.</Review>
            <Review>With virtually nothing that happens onscreen resembling human behavior or emotion to any real extend, the film can't even function as propaganda.</Review>

        <Duration>89</Duration>
        <StoryLine>After 81 days of solitary detention world famous Chinese artist Ai Weiwei is put under house arrest. He suffers from sleeping disorder and memory loss, 18 cameras are monitoring his studio and home, police agents follow his every move, and heavy restrictions from the Kafkaesque Chinese authorities weigh him down. Picking up where Alison Klayman's Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry left off, AI WEIWEI THE FAKE CASE is more explicitly political, reflecting Ai's battle against the gigantic lawsuit thrust upon him by the Chinese government in an effort to silence him. Ai Weiwei is shaken, but during his year on probation he steadily finds new ways to provoke and challenge the mighty powers of the Chinese authorities in his fight for human rights and free expression. The film also features the creation of S.A.C.R.E.D., a new work depicting Ai's time in prison, which premiered during the Venice Biennale. (C) International Film Circuit</StoryLine>

            <Review>Ai granted Johnsen significant access to his personal and professional lives following his release, including his tender interactions with his young son, and the film's intimate nature recalls the verite style of Ai's own video work.</Review>
            <Review>Remarkably intimate and astute.</Review>
            <Review>Although expertly edited, Johnsen's film, whose soundtrack ends with Nina Simone's "Feeling Good," presents a less effective portrait of Ai than Klayman's does.</Review>
            <Review>The film quietly and slowly reveals a man struggling internally to find the right response to the restrictions imposed on him and determining that to stop speaking out would itself be a kind of death.</Review>
            <Review>Johnsen intimately chronicles the fascinating push-pull of Ai's daily existence: the man he truly is now contrasted with the man he hopes to become once again.</Review>

            <Review>While little more than an update on an ongoing dispute, The Fake Case is a welcome chance to catch up with the quirky artist's heroic struggle for freedom.</Review>

            <Review>It takes effort to turn a movie with a cast as appealing as the one in "The Longest Week" into a grating exercise in narcissism, but writer and director Peter Glanz proves up to the task.</Review>
            <Review>It's clearly the work not of a lazy thief, but of a raw talent who's still struggling to find his own voice. In the meantime, his impressions are pretty darn impressive.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director Peter Glanz seems determined to make a subpar Wes Anderson knockoff. And in that sense, he has achieved undeniable success.</Review>
            <Review>Lacking any significant character arc or motivation, The Longest Week is little more than a series of insipid conversations between bored aristocrats who snark at each other in monotone.</Review>
            <Review>Tiresome romcom doesn't live up to promise; some iffy stuff.</Review>
            <Review>Throughout the film, the writing is heady but heartless, as if Glanz means to occupy the intellectual high ground by exploiting tired romantic clichés and passing off his finger pointing as evidence of self-righteousness.</Review>

            <Review>A soulful romance, an existential action flick and something of a miracle movie - the appealing slow-burner "Salvo" hovers at the crossroads of genre.</Review>
            <Review>Viewers looking for a shoot-em-up will be disappointed, but those hankering for an old-school Italian broodfest will find plenty to soak in.</Review>
            <Review>It's not the tale, but the telling of it, that distinguishes this Sicilian drama.</Review>
            <Review>Hits the heights in its first forty minutes ... Later developments prove disappointingly predictable.</Review>
            <Review>Very stylish Sicilian mafia movie. One part Antonioni and one part Calvin Klein commercial.</Review>
            <Review>In the end, it's Salvo itself that's murky and obscure.</Review>
            <Review>This inventiveness extends to the way the directors frame violence.</Review>
            <Review>Salvo is a strange, involving, if flawed movie about the Sicilian mafia; a stylised drama with elements of the supernatural and the sentimental amid the tension.</Review>
            <Review>Set during a Palermo heatwave, the film opens with a truly scorching action scene... The drama that subsequently unfolds, however, substitutes slow-burning tension for shock.</Review>
            <Review>Exquisitely crafted if somewhat academic - an "ambient thriller", if there's such a thing.</Review>
            <Review>Salvo is nicely put together, and told for the most part without recourse to words. But under the Sicilian swagger, there's not much substance or character to cling to.</Review>
            <Review>You might argue that an exercise in style over substance is just what we need for a study of the fashion industry.</Review>

        <StoryLine>When eerie and inexplicable events, closely akin to the horrors that had been visited upon the Lakota people in recent years, begin to occur in the western town, everything seems to point to the newest resident, Henry Seed. Questions abound as to whether Seed is some sort of supernatural demon seeking retribution and revenge or if there is a more simple explanation for each of the occurrences.

            <Review>It seems to have been made by people who couldn't decide if their film was a horror flick, a whodunit, or a Hellboy knockoff.</Review>
            <Review>Radcliffe, through his sheer presence and the piercing honesty of those big, blue eyes, makes this mixed-up material watchable.</Review>
            <Review>Horns juggles a lot of balls, and admirably keeps them in the air for longer than you might expect. But it doesn't know how to bring them down gently.</Review>
            <Review>There are a couple of decent movies somewhere inside "Horns." But here's the real sin - Aja has no idea in hell of what they are.</Review>
            <Review>Campy-fun but pointless ...</Review>
            <Review>"Horns" is a good-ideas-gone-wild movie that leaves the best of itself behind.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately, its best results are too few and far between - to which excuses for its tone and intent can only go so far.</Review>
            <Review>At nearly two hours, "Horns" is about 30 minutes longer than it needs to be. But it's doubtful even a shorter version would cure what ails this film. Maybe you have to be tripped out on LSD to appreciate it.</Review>
            <Review>Draws out a heretofore unseen compassion in Aja, who dials the grue way down and focuses on the terrific cast he's hired.</Review>
            <Review>There are times when you will want to look away from the horrors shown on the screen but it will be hard to wipe the smile off your face.</Review>
            <Review>Horns appears to be of the persuasion that everybody is a liar and inherently evil, and it's a disappointingly one-note approach to a premise that could use a lighter touch.</Review>
            <Review>Daniel Radcliffe gives an absolutely incredible performance that Horns doesn't really seem to fully appreciate. But the ludicrous ending derails the film from what was otherwise a gripping mystery thriller.</Review>

            <Review>This Scottish romcom is a great advert for Glasgow, but it delivers an awful warning to filmmakers about shooting a script that's seriously unready.</Review>
            <Review>A trifling comedy about writer's block that aims for a blend of Richard Curtis-style cheeriness and arch literary satire, and winds up mostly drawing a blank.</Review>
            <Review>Brit romcom about writer's block has brief nudity, cliches.</Review>
            <Review>The cast gives it what they can, but they are underserved by choppy direction and a simplistic script that never breaks the surface.</Review>
            <Review>The film's ending was indeed a happy moment, but not in the intended manner.</Review>
            <Review>Contrived, manic and unfunny the film also flounders because of the lack of chemistry between an awkward Gillan and a wooden Weber.</Review>
            <Review>That convention-flouting title misleads: this winsome affair lags lamentably close to the modern romcom average.</Review>
            <Review>This may look like a rom-com, with its obvious plotting and over-cute characters, but it's eerily lacking any actual romance or comedy.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately worth seeing thanks to a charming lead performance from Karen Gillan, strong comic support from Iain De Caestecker and a handful of decent gags.</Review>
            <Review>It may not have the bite of a Bridesmaids, but in Gillan's sparky performance there's enough to keep you engaged for the duration.</Review>
            <Review>McKay's film often feels like Richard Curtis-lite for the New Girl generation - minus the jokes and memorable characters.</Review>
            <Review>Impeded by a weak script and poorly-drawn characters, Not Another Happy Ended is an all too often muddled and unsatisfying affair.</Review>

            <Review>Score one for Satan.</Review>
            <Review>The effects are hilarious, the sets are rinky-dink, and the character names are funnier than a full season of 'Big Bang Theory,' and the "narrative arc" of our heroine is laughably predictable.</Review>
            <Review>The only prayers Left Behind inspires are for Nicolas Cage's career.</Review>
            <Review>Ostensibly an exploration of biblical themes, Left Behind avoids any theological debate to revel unsuccessfully in the mass-hysteria created by God's Rapture.</Review>
            <Review>I never thought I'd write this, but Kirk Cameron's Left Behind, flawed as it is, looks and sounds better in almost every single way.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Like most inquisitive boys, 12-year old Sam wants to know about UFOs, horror movies, ghosts, and girls. Sam also has leukemia, and although the adults in his life don't want him to dwell on it, Sam wants to know everything about his disease and death, a possibility he might face. Together with his best friend, Felix, he embarks on a "scientific investigation" with questions, observations, evidence, reflections, and lists of all the things he wants to do someday -- like breaking a world record, flying in a blimp, kissing a girl for the first time, and experiencing what it's like to be a teenager. In this poignant yet ultimately uplifting tale, Sam and his family face the immensity of an uncertain future with love, humor, and a touch of the unexpected. (c) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>There should be something more exhilarating about the violent and hopeful epilogue finale than there is.</Review>
            <Review>It's a little dumb (OK, maybe more than a little), but "No Good Deed" is an otherwise brisk, efficient thriller that won't punish audiences who drop in.</Review>
            <Review>No Good Deed practically fetishizes the brutality Idris Elba's character inflicts on a number of women. It sexualizes him as a killing machine. It wants us to salivate over him and tremble before him simultaneously.</Review>
            <Review>The final plot twist is about as fiendishly clever as an episode of General Hospital. Is that a spoiler? You're welcome.</Review>
            <Review>With performers as strong as Henson and Elba, and the guidance of director Sam Miller, who's worked with Elba in a handful of Luther episodes, it should have yielded more. The trite third act reveal only further sours the wasted potential.</Review>
            <Review>No Good Deed is an example of the worst kind of exploitative thriller.</Review>
            <Review>It's too pointless to be even a guilty pleasure, plunging past "low rent" into "no rent" territory, dragging two competent performers down into the mud with it.</Review>
            <Review>"No Good Deed" made some decent box office and didn't cost much to make. Perhaps there'll be a sequel. "Good Samaritan Goes Bad" or "Call Triple-A, Cause I Ain't Opening the Door."</Review>
            <Review>No Good Deed is one of the least inspired and laziest films of 2014, featuring a complete lack of originality and a waste of talent from Idris Elba and Taraji P. Henson.</Review>
            <Review>There's a few table-turning twists that lend a veneer of final-girl sister-power ... but little else to provide big-screen distraction.</Review>
            <Review>It is dismaying to see the brilliant Idris Elba and Sam Miller, his director from TV's Luther, working on low-grade exploitation fare like this.</Review>
            <Review>It wants to be "Cape Fear," but would easily settle for "Prom Night." Elba isn't scary and badly miscast as a serial killer.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Combative, provocative, and searingly blunt, Admiral Hyman G. Rickover was a flamboyant maverick and a unique American hero. When few thought it possible, then-Captain Rickover harnessed the power of the atom to drive the first nuclear-powered submarine, the USS Nautilus, whose trip under the polar ice pack was one of the great adventure stories of the 1950s. Later, Rickover built the world's first nuclear aircraft carrier and the first commercial nuclear power plant at Shippingport, PA. Rickover's achievements made him into a national celebrity, and he appeared on the cover of Time magazine. Today, questions about nuclear power have arisen again, in the wake of the disaster in Japan, yet nuclear power remains one of the main alternatives to fossil fuels. Many wonder whether America can maintain its technological pre-eminence and whether we can still build and manage large-scale projects. To understand these issues, RICKOVER considers the story of the man who created the Nuclear Navy as well as the civilian nuclear power industry: Hyman G. Rickover.</StoryLine>

        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>86</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Nat Hentoff is one of the enduring voices of the last 65 years, a writer who championed jazz as an art form and who also led the rise of 'alternative' journalism in America. This unique documentary wraps the themes of liberty, identity and free expression around a historical narrative that stretches from the Great Depression to the Patriot Act. At the core of the film are three extraordinary, intimate conversations with Hentoff. Commentary and perspective are offered through additional interviews with such luminaries as Amiri Baraka, Stanley Crouch, Floyd Abrams, Aryeh Neier and Dan Morgenstern. Interwoven through it all is the sublime music of Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Charles Mingus and Bob Dylan, along with never-before-seen photographs and archival footage of these artists and other cultural figures at the height of their powers.

            <Review>Stooped at almost 90 but feisty and humor-filled as ever, Hentoff presides over a film rich in the sounds and occasional sights of legendary cultural figures, from Lenny Bruce and Malcolm X to Bob Dylan and Coleman Hawkins.</Review>
            <Review>Still going strong in his 80s, Hentoff has had one of the more variegated careers in American letters.</Review>
            <Review>The film moves fluidly between Hentoff's career focus on the Constitution and jazz, his "two main reasons for being," seeing freedom as the key to the beauty of both.</Review>

            <Review>Remarkably fluid and never lass than compellingly watchable.</Review>
            <Review>The documentary really takes off in its second half, when Pleasures chronicles Hentoff's transition from "Mr. Liberal" (as one journalist calls him after his defense of the Nazi marches in Skokie) to an unapologetic pro-life advocate.</Review>

            <Review>The movie feels entirely promotional, provoking separate, unanswered questions about green medicine too.</Review>
            <Review>It's possible to admire the four directors' unflinching depiction of the dying process, but the film is mostly unilluminating and grim - not least because almost all of the deaths discussed are untimely.</Review>
            <Review>Less an introduction to the green-burial movement than a portrait of one man who embraced it after being diagnosed with a terminal illness, A Will for the Woods is more sentimental than journalistic.</Review>
            <Review>While the film also captures many private, sometimes heartbreaking scenes, it takes a lot of time to make its simple point.</Review>
            <Review>n the film's sobering final act, we get to see the man's beliefs put to practice...fulfill[ing] his wishes--including using this film to share his philosophy with the world.</Review>
            <Review>The unknowables and intangibles around death are what make it so scary, and Clark's journey demonstrates how fear can dissipate if one takes control of what's going to happen to them.</Review>
            <Review>Just as Dr. Wang approached his own death with purpose and honor, the filmmakers have done the same in telling his story and making it ours as well.</Review>
            <Review>But A Will for the Woods is more contemplative than preachy. This spirit might, ironically, limit its audience more than if it had drawn a harder and angrier line. But that generosity makes for a finer film.</Review>
            <Review>An enlightening look at the Green Burial Movement and its ecological and spiritual dimensions.</Review>
            <Review>While the "green burial movement" does play a notable role here, the documentary's other strength is how it captures Clark coming to grips with his impending death.</Review>
            <Review>...A Will For The Woods transforms into a truly moving experience, and a testimony to the difference that a single life can make in the lives of others.</Review>
            <Review>A Will for the Woods will help build awareness of the movement while also telling an immersive (for everyone, including the embedded filmmakers), heartwarming tale of one man's passionate struggle to find both peace on earth and peace in earth..."</Review>

            <Review>Tusk is not a particularly good movie, but the vivid anxiety dream at its heart makes it one of the most personal films this writer-director has ever made.</Review>

            <Review>'Tusk' opens with the sound of two men laughing at their own jokes, so I guess a doff of the cap is due to the filmmaker for encapsulating his movie so efficiently, right from the jump.</Review>

        <StoryLine>"Elsa and Fred" is the story of two people who, at the end of the road, discover that it's never too late to love and make dreams come true. Elsa has lived for the past 60 years dreaming of a moment that Fellini had already envisaged: the scene in 'La Dolce Vita' at the Fontana di Trevi. The same scene without Anita Ekberg in it, but with Elsa instead. Without Marcello Mastroiani but with that love that took so long to arrive. Fred is a bit younger than Elsa and has always been a good man who did everything he was supposed to do. After losing his wife, he feels disturbed and confused and his daughter decides that it would be best if he moves into a smaller apartment where he ends meeting Elsa. (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>Unlike so many American remakes of foreign films, this reboot improves on the original, mostly because it takes full advantage of the star power of its English-speaking cast.</Review>
            <Review>This movie is so tone-deaf that it tries to wring charm from questionable stereotypes about senior citizens and minorities.</Review>
            <Review>A not-terrific, not-terrible romantic comedy that owes most of its charm to its two stars.</Review>
            <Review>A bland and formulaic tale of two senior citizens who discover that it's never too late to fall in love - which may well be true, but doesn't keep this rickety recycling of a 2005 Spanish-Argentinean comedy from feeling long past its sell-by date.</Review>
            <Review>The movie's too-cute concept yields more rewards than you might reasonably expect.</Review>
            <Review>Though the issues are heavy, the execution is light, enjoyable, but it keeps "Elsa &amp; Fred" closer to "Sleepless in Seattle" than Fellini's deliciously deep Roman affair.</Review>
            <Review>This story of love in the autumn of life is not without its charms, though it takes a crisp and well-judged performance from Plummer to balance MacLaine's shrill extravagance.</Review>
            <Review>Elsa &amp; Fred is a sweet story that reminds you that it is never too late to make your dreams come true.</Review>
            <Review>Considering the CVs of all involved (not least Radford, who was Oscar-nominated for Il Postino) this remains little more than a gooey footnote.</Review>

            <Review>This tepid indie comedy lacks a consistent tone; directors Tom Dolby and Tom Williams can't decide whether to satirize or sympathize with their wealthy, self-regarding characters.</Review>
            <Review>A flat drama filmed at a house that's more interesting than most of the characters.</Review>
            <Review>The characters flutter about, argue and flirt, but they are simply too bland and vacuous to make much of an impression.</Review>
            <Review>Clarkson embodies the longings, doubts and confusions of such a woman, without judgment or excess sympathy. She is just there, a fact, and completely believable.</Review>
            <Review>All the possibilities of a richly drawn family squabble fade faster than the final days of summer.</Review>
            <Review>This first feature from co-directors Tom Dolby and Tom Williams is too muted in its catharsis and too overcrowded with superfluous characters to be fully satisfying, but the delicate central performance keeps it watchable.</Review>
            <Review>Indie drama about family dysfunction has mature themes.</Review>
            <Review>Tone-deaf, tin-eared drama about largely unlikable people with lots of money and a lot of self-indulgent problems.</Review>
            <Review>At least the scenery is lovely when it's not being blocked by these annoying humans.</Review>
            <Review>A sort of modern Chekhovian study of family tensions over a country weekend, this indie drama is very pretty to look at and at times disarming, but needed more punch.</Review>
            <Review>The film's attempt at political commentary amounts to a half-baked treatise on good governance in the face of tyranny and socioeconomic exploitation.</Review>
            <Review>Lovely. Features an award-worthy performance by the never-disappointing Patricia Clarkson that fully utilizes her sensitivity, comic timing and other distinctive acting gifts.</Review>

            <Review>The resulting domestic tension is rife with darkly comedic and dramatic possibilities that were better exploited on the printed page, where King was able to more fully delineate his heroine's tortured thought process.</Review>
            <Review>A wry, old-fashioned thriller adapted by King from his short story.</Review>
            <Review>It's arguably the dullest King film yet, despite solid work by LaPaglia to save it and a decent set-up that goes absolutely nowhere.</Review>
            <Review>Mr. King's script offers a wealth of behavioral details, notably in the conversations between Bob and Darcy, which put a deliciously perverse twist on conjugal familiarity.</Review>
            <Review>Much thinner than you would expect.</Review>
            <Review>In his approach to bringing his own story to the screen, the author gave no consideration for actual performance or humor, valuing his language over all else.</Review>
            <Review>Veteran actors Allen, Lapaglia and Stephen Lang add a level of gravitas that sells the material, countering the matter-of-fact direction from Peter Askin that lends the air of a made-for-TV movie. But they can do only so much with a story this listless.</Review>
            <Review>... lacks consistent suspense and relies too often on genre cliches instead of the clever twists that such material usually commands.</Review>
            <Review>Suspenseful and compelling with great camera work and fine performances by Joan Allen and Anthony LaPaglia, despite an ending that feels rushed and contrived.</Review>
            <Review>Slick and haunting, this film delves into the things that hold a marriage together in a way only Stephen King would even begin to attempt.</Review>
            <Review>Creepy but underwhelming tale of a truly killer marriage.</Review>
            <Review>A Good Marriage comes off as curiously flat for a movie about a woman who sleeps next to a murderer every night.</Review>

        <Duration>110</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Two siblings who grew up in a dysfunctional household pass their damage along to those around them in this drama from Danish filmmaker Thomas Vinterberg. Nick (Jacob Cedergren) was raised by a mother with serious drinking problems who inflicted physical and emotional cruelty on her children. Now in his early thirties, Nick is an ex-con who has his own problems with alcohol and little sense of direction in his life. Back on the streets after a stay in jail, Nick lives in a shabby hostel, has an on-again, off-again relationship with Sofie (Patricia Schumann), whose alcoholism has cost her custody of her children, lifts weights and sometimes looks in on Ivan (Morten Rose), the troubled brother of a girl he one loved. Meanwhile, Nick's younger brother (Peter Plaugborg) has his own demons; he's a heroin addict who is running out of ways to finance his habit, and while he loves his young son Martin (Gustav Fischer Kjaerulff), managing his habit and looking after his child are more than he can manage at the same time. Adapted from the novel by Jonas T. Bengtsson, Submarino was an official selection at the 2010 Berlin International Film Festival.</StoryLine>

            <Review>At times "Reach Me" is undeniably intriguing, mostly because it's just so weird and disconnected. Eventually, though, it just becomes tiresome.</Review>
            <Review>Nothing in the proceedings is remotely convincing, let alone entertaining.</Review>
            <Review>Once you've sunk into the entirely warped groove of "Reach Me" you're almost eager to experience the next offense against aesthetics and/or common sense it is poised to commit.</Review>
            <Review>'Reach Me' is the sort of movie where careers go to die.</Review>
            <Review>A kitchen-sink mess with no discernible narrative drive or thematic resonance beyond uninspired batches of bad behavior, gunplay, eccentricity and weak uplift.</Review>
            <Review>Casting Sylvester Stallone as a gossip-site publisher obviously modeled on Matt Drudge is one of many counterintuitive ideas that backfire in "Reach Me."</Review>
            <Review>It's 'Pulp Fiction' lite with blaxploitation aspects. Regardless, a movie about beating addictions, getting more out of life, and being a better person, is a good thing.</Review>
            <Review>The jokes aren't funny and the earnest stabs at emotional sincerity ring false in this ensemble melodrama.</Review>
            <Review>Herzfeld is determined to make these puzzle pieces fit, yet there isn't much to solve with Reach Me, which gradually limps to a cop-out close.</Review>
            <Review>Reach Me feels lazy, in desperate need of its own motivational speech.</Review>

            <Review>Noting the giant plot holes and laughing at the picture's overinflated self-importance become the closest thing it offers to entertainment. God, what a rotten movie this is.</Review>
            <Review>Washington's had much worse pulp outings than this and here he's done a bang-up job.</Review>
            <Review>A painfully straightforward and frequently predictable thriller whose primary redeeming feature is a leading man that deserves better.</Review>
            <Review>There's nothing particularly terrible or poorly constructed about The Equalizer, but its presence in our current cultural landscape renders it innocuous.</Review>
            <Review>The Equalizer is empty and merely efficient but it's enjoyable as hell with Washington in solid, focused Man On Fire form.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>85</Duration>
        <StoryLine>In 2006, 25-year-old Jason DaSilva was on vacation at the beach with family when, suddenly, he fell down. He couldn't get back up. His legs had stopped working; his disease could no longer be ignored. Just a few months earlier doctors had told him that he had multiple sclerosis, which could lead to loss of vision and muscle control, as well as a myriad of other complications. Jason tried exercise to help cope, but the problem only worsened. After his dispiriting fall on the beach, he turned to his Mom, who reminded him that, despite his disease, he was still a fortunate kid who had the opportunity to pursue the things he loved most: art and filmmaking. Jason picked up the camera, turned it on his declining body, and set out on a worldwide journey in search of healing, self-discovery, and love. An emotional documentary filled with unexpected moments of humor and joy, WHEN I WALK is a life-affirming film driven by a young man's determination to survive-and to make sense of a devastating disease through the art of cinema.(c) Official SIte</StoryLine>

            <Review>As a public service, however, this is quite successful, presenting in intimate, straightforward terms the challenges of living with physical disabilities.</Review>
            <Review>So much of this documentary is like a smattering of poor selfies and vlog entries--context-less, background-less and persistently, frustratingly short on details--that it remains less memorable than your average Hollywood disability biopic.</Review>
            <Review>There are no great or big moments to point at in this film, but there are many little observations that, added up to a whole, have resonance.</Review>
            <Review>It's incredibly up close and personal like an uplifting and real vlog not meant for others to see.</Review>
            <Review>A poignant documentary about the love and support needed by victims of multiple sclerosis.</Review>
            <Review>Credit the filmmaker for his honesty and sense of humor, which makes his story more emotionally powerful than any sort of pity or forced poignancy from an outsider.</Review>
            <Review>Intimate, deeply moving, candid and revealing. Anyone who watches When I Walk will be quite proud of Jason DaSilva.</Review>

        <Title>Uncle Kent</Title>
        <ReleaseDate/>
        <Duration>72</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Joe Swanberg makes his first Sundance appearance with his most mature film, UNCLE KENT, an aching true-to-life modern comedy about aging, loneliness, desire, and the awkward intimacies of online friendship. The film follows forty-year-old Kent (Kent Osborne) who is an unmarried children's show writer living alone with his cat in Los Angeles. He spends his days sketching gag cartoons and bouncing ideas off his hyperactive friend, Kev (Kevin Bewersdorf), and his nights staving off loneliness in Internet chat rooms. When one of Kent's online acquaintances, environmental journalist Kate (Jennifer Prediger), crashes at his house for the weekend, he finds himself attracted to her coquettish manner and frank emotional openness but sexually frustrated by her fidelity to a distant boyfriend. -- (C) IFC Films</StoryLine>

            <Review>The prolific and daring independent filmmaker Joe Swanberg captures the loneliness of the long-term D.I.Y. artist in the age of social networking.</Review>
            <Review>"Hi, where have you been all my life?" may be learned behavior, but it always sounds good up close... [A] sense of life-just-happens and what-the-------just-happened, those instants just before cheeks flush and unwelcome memories etch.</Review>
            <Review>Uncle Kent is much too intriguing to be discarded as merely twee, softcore hackwork.</Review>
            <Review>At 72 minutes, it's hardly a big ask.</Review>
            <Review>Swanberg seems to be making films that can be mistaken for reality TV shows, except his characters are the type that would never be considered for such programming because they are a bit too uncolorful, almost but not quite milquetoast-y.</Review>
            <Review>'He used to do tricks with his penis' isn't really character development.</Review>
            <Review>If you come in midway you'll think you stumbled upon some unedited webcam feed, but this is, I suppose, the new aesthetic of the avant-garde</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately, if Kent learns anything, it's that he's probably too old for all this crap -- and that's a mature realization for a film genre usually known for its youth and 'hey, whatever' attitude.</Review>
            <Review>...the latest underwhelming drama from a man who stubbornly refuses to grow as a filmmaker...</Review>
            <Review>It's a portrait of stunted middle-aged maturity that comes off as a performance of self-gratification.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Examine the growing threat of a nuclear Iran through interviews with Middle East policy experts, prominent politicians, Iranian dissidents, and a number of other well-informed specialists in this eye-opening documentary. While the Iranian government claims that nuclear energy is their natural right, the majority of American politicians seem to have turned a blind eye to the brutal actions of the current regime against their own people. As the Iranian public expresses a growing desire to join the global community, the powers that be seem to close their doors to the outside world through reckless rhetoric and religious oppression. In this film, we witness the many possible outcomes should the Iranian nuclear genie get out of the bottle, and learn just why American politicians have been fighting a losing battle in their attempt to gain leverage over the Iranian government.</StoryLine>

            <Review>This hedonistic japery is shot through with middle-aged melancholy and the fear of death.</Review>
            <Review>If it's your cup of tea, you're likely to spill it from laughing so hard. Somebody send these two on another holiday.</Review>
            <Review>It's that melancholy within each man that saves the film from disposability.</Review>
            <Review>By the time Coogan is addressing Brydon as Yorick in a skull-filled catacomb outside Naples, the film's true subject has been made as crystal clear as the case surrounding a lava-crusted corpse in old Pompeii.</Review>
            <Review>The Trip to Italy doesn't feel entirely new, but there's comfort in familiarity, too.</Review>
            <Review>Where comedy provides the tonic in so many films, it's the hint of reality that pushes in at the edges and changes the pace here. These guys are funny. But they know their longer trip will continue once the last plate of pasta is empty.</Review>
            <Review>It's very smart and entertaining, and if Coogan, Brydon and Winterbottom want to do a third film, I'd be more than happy to take another ride with them.</Review>
            <Review>Given the excellence of Coogan and Brydon's back and forth, the generally lame nature of The Trip to Italy is all the more disappointing.</Review>
            <Review>As derivative as this film may be to its predecessor, funny is funny.</Review>
            <Review>Under the direction of returning filmmaker Michael Winterbottom, their new 'Trip' is just as funny, sharp, and telling as its predecessor.</Review>
            <Review>Both films are rather light when it comes to narrative, but it is rather fascinating to watch Coogan and Brydon portray their own somewhat unsympathetic meta-analogs.</Review>
            <Review>It's 'second verse, same as the first.' Thank God.</Review>

            <Review>In its total inspirational sweep, it earns comparison to the movement it chronicles - as an organized, well-calculated piece of political theater.</Review>
            <Review>This film moves effortlessly from some pretty intense dramatic moments to hilarious scenes showcasing the contrasting lifestyles of the gay and straight worlds to some vignettes of incredible poignancy.</Review>
            <Review>This portrayal of the unlikely 1980s alliance between London gay-rights activists and striking Welsh miners is, quite simply, one of the best movies of the year so far.</Review>
            <Review>The important twist is that Pride seems to capture the essence of reality, giving it the recognition it deserves. Truth really is stranger than fiction, and Pride tells that truth with flair.</Review>
            <Review>Schmaltzy and formulaic, but also lively and sincere.</Review>
            <Review>Warchus really knows how to stage musical theater for the movies. He makes you want to dance. More amazing, however, is that he also makes you want to vote.</Review>
            <Review>Pride has its audience-pleasing contrivances and the vaguest hint of cheese, and yet, nonetheless, it is fine and fabulous entertainment.</Review>
            <Review>A top-flight cast gives it a rollicking, irresistibly entertaining reading that makes up for its occasional implausibilities and sanitised superficialities.</Review>
            <Review>In this age of cultivated buddy lists, location-based hookup apps, circuit parties, Fire Island summer shares, open relationships and via-surrogacy parenthood, the reminder that "Pride" serves couldn't have come at a better time.</Review>
            <Review>Pride is one of those movies you will see by chance and end up very satisfied. [full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Matthew Warchus does a great job telling the story in a fun way with perfect comedic timing. [full review in Spanish]</Review>

            <Review>There's a sense that The Good Lie wants to say something profound but the message is as muddled as its delineation of history is.</Review>
            <Review>The main characters are played by actual refugees-two of whom were child soldiers-and their uninflected, authoritative performances compensate for the feel-good simplifications of Margaret Nagle's script.</Review>
            <Review>A well-told tale that illuminates the experiences of the 20,000 "lost boys" (and girls) of Sudan, with such grace, insight and humor, it can be forgiven a few simplifying liberties taken in the name of moving the narrative along.</Review>
            <Review>If a moviegoer can't cry for the great tragedy of these Sudanese children, and be touched by their small victories, then who on earth deserves our tears and cheers?</Review>
            <Review>If a measure of tasteful restraint is detectable, it serves at least to allow for the depiction of human emotion instead of the market-driven blandification of history.</Review>
            <Review>It's often earnest to a fault and fearful of its deeper, darker implications. Still, you won't leave The Good Lie unmoved. Its heart really is in the right place,</Review>
            <Review>A credible, engaging and beautiful moral drama that is unusually smart for a Hollywood studio picture.</Review>
            <Review>This is humble and subtle filmmaking and is a must watch.</Review>
            <Review>[The three central brothers] performances add an authenticity to a story that's clearly put through the Hollywoodisation machine but never feels dishonest.</Review>
            <Review>Strong performances from Arnold Oceng, Ger Duany and Emmanuel Jal ensure that the characters of Mamere, Jeremiah and Paul are never reduced to "exotic" victimhood.</Review>

            <Review>Grumpy Cat's Worst Christmas Ever could use a whole lot more of Plaza's ad-libbed derision for the entire project and the suckers who find themselves watching it. The claws do come out, but the scratches just aren't deep enough.</Review>
            <Review>The Christmas miracle of this movie is that Grumpy Cat's Worst Christmas Ever isn't the worst Christmas movie ever.</Review>
            <Review>There's a plot, which any of us could have written in our sleep.</Review>
            <Review>The best way to describe the film as a whole would be if Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure, Home Alone, Garfield, icanhascheezburger, product placement, commercial breaks, outdated cultural references, suburban community theater, and acid had a baby.</Review>
            <Review>[It] has some funny lines from Plaza while occasionally inserting Grumpy Cat into ridiculous situations, but is mostly trying to do what it can within the limitations of its budget, its network and its leading feline.</Review>
            <Review>If the people behind Sharknado could make a movie about Santa, it would look something like this.</Review>
            <Review>This movie is definitely worth the watch if you need a little cheese added to your Christmas.</Review>
            <Review>Grumpy Cat's thriving merchandise line is the obvious motivation behind this otherwise forgettable movie.</Review>

        <StoryLine>A witty, spirited and action-&amp;#8208;packed adventure about an almost-&amp;#8208;thirteen-&amp;#8208;year-&amp;#8208;old boy named Nono, his world of confusions, fears and fantasies... Nono longs to be a good detective like his father, a famous police inspector, but his wild nature constantly gets him into trouble. Gaby, his father's secretary, cherishes Nono and recognizes his anguish, which comes from his lack of knowledge about his mother, who died when he was very little. Two days before his bar mitzvah, he is sent off to his uncle's to be disciplined yet again. Once on the train, the over-imaginative boy discovers one last chance to prove himself. Together with charming international thief Felix Glick, an old acquaintance of his father's, he travels to the French Rivera and enters a world of disguises and crazy pursuits, crossing paths with the famous singer Lola Ciperola (played by Isabella Rossellini) and Zohara, a mysterious woman whose secrets will forever change Nono's life. Based on the beloved novel by David Grossman, The Zigzag Kid uses wit and humor to explore the most fundamental questions of good and evil and to speak directly to adults and teenagers.

        <Title>The Notebook</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>112</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Towards the end of World War II, a desperate young mother leaves her 13&amp;#8208;year&amp;#8208;old twin sons at their grandmother's house in the Hungarian countryside, despite the fact that this grandmother is a cruel and bestial alcoholic. Previously pampered, the twins must learn how to survive alone in their new, rural surroundings. They realize that the only way to cope with the absurd and inhumane world of adults and war is to become completely unfeeling and merciless. By learning to free themselves from hunger, pain and emotion, they will be able to endure future hardships. So they begin their own series of studies: they fortify their spirits by reading the Bible and learning foreign languages. They practice every day to harden their bodies and minds. They hold their hands over flames, cut their legs, arms and chests with a knife and pour alcohol right on their wounds. They desensitize themselves to insults and learn to ignore the more insidious appeals of sentiment and love. The twins keep a written record of all they have witnessed during the war, Le Grand Cahier (The Notebook). Over time they are initiated into the corruptions and horrors of a war&amp;#8208;torn world. They have to listen to a lecherous priest's hypocritical avowals of faith, they watch soldiers herd refugees to their death and witness the selfish cruelties their neighbors inflict on one another. As the war ends, the "Liberation" brings the worst moments of all: their village and their few relationships are plagued by rape and suicide. Their mother returns for a brief, gruesome reunion and their father follows suit in a final tableau involving patricide and opportunism, leading to the twin's ultimate separation.

            <Review>The relentless calamity becomes a grind, offering few insights beyond ones that are obvious in the first half hour.</Review>
            <Review>In adapting the novel, Szasz and screenwriters Tom Abrams and Andras Szeker tread carefully, leaving a lot to the imagination ...</Review>
            <Review>A bleak, despairing testament to the cruelty of war, and how it mangles and defaces everyone it touches.</Review>
            <Review>If only I could figure out what all this was meant to stand for.</Review>
            <Review>Thoroughly unpleasant and at the same time completely unedifying.</Review>
            <Review>Not a movie for those who insist on happy resolutions, "The Notebook" is instead a study in how the nihilistic worldview that clouds the collective Eastern Europe sensibility came to be.</Review>
            <Review>While some sequences are powerful and even shocking, the cumulative effect lacks emotional punch, due in part to the uneven performances and the familiarity of the material.</Review>
            <Review>Are you a nihilist? Trouble finding a way to bring satisfaction to a Friday night in the void of meaningless suffering that is your universe? Well, do I have the movie for you.</Review>
            <Review>The movie makes an obvious statement about the cruelties of war, but that does not diminish the ferocity of its story and how two pampered boys are transformed into soulless and callous youths.</Review>
            <Review>There's something haunting going on here -- in the story, in the performances, in the overall atmosphere -- that makes it hard to look away from, and equally hard to forget.</Review>
            <Review>Don't let its Nicholas Sparks-like title fool you.</Review>
            <Review>Committed to calcified emotions, the film and characters often feel dramatically inert but Szász keeps the film going with moments that are haunting and provocative.</Review>

            <Review>A vital, urgent and infuriating look at the devastating failures of the juvenile court system and the insidious reach of prison privatization.</Review>
            <Review>In his directorial debut, Robert May examines in granular detail the causes and effects of the scandal, and interviewed dozens of people over a number of years.</Review>
            <Review>May errs, however, in styling this human interest saga.</Review>
            <Review>A carefully measured, admirably precise account of this sordid business.</Review>
            <Review>This provides enough valuable information to constitute a worthy public service announcement.</Review>
            <Review>Without sensationalizing his already scandalous material, Mr. May arranges the contributions of reporters, lawyers and anguished relatives of young offenders into a shocking and impartial portrait of justice denied and childhoods erased.</Review>
            <Review>'Kids for Cash' will scare the wits out of anyone worried about how institutional neglect is affecting our kids.</Review>
            <Review>The film is imperfect in its structure, but director Robert May never sensationalizes what is horrifying enough in its straightforward telling.</Review>
            <Review>Kids for Cash does what any great advocacy doc does: give you the cold hard facts to get you angry and make you want to pay attention so that something like this never happens again.</Review>
            <Review>Its small filmmaking flaws aside, the story of Kids For Cash is a powerful and important one.</Review>
            <Review>While the film has heroes -- this is part of the utility of May's filmmaking -- the conclusions about the juvenile justice system in this country are even more haunting.</Review>
            <Review>That the film showcases the students after these experiences indicates the broader stakes of this story, from the judge's self-delusions to the parents' frustrations to the kids' ongoing struggles.</Review>

        <Duration>110</Duration>
        <StoryLine>In this thoughtful science fiction drama from filmmaker Kanji Nakajima, Kohei Takahara (Mitsuhiro Oikawa) is an astronaut who is invited to take part in a top-secret scientific study in which a clone will be created from his DNA and brought to life in the event of his untimely death. Kohei agrees to participate, and when he loses his life as his mission goes awry while returning to Earth, the clone is brought to life. While the "new" Kohei seems healthy and all but indistinguishable from the original, a major flaw is soon discovered -- the clone has no memories past Kohei's childhood, and doesn't comprehend the notion of the astronaut's death. When the clone escapes, it happens to find Kohei's body near the crash site, and is jarred back to a memory of the death of Kohei's twin brother when he was little. The clone is convinced Kohei's corpse is actually the lost twin that died years ago, and he sets out to take the body back to his family. Kuron Wa Kokyo O Mezasu (aka The Clone Returns Home) received its American premiere at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>90</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Film essayist Thom Andersen (Los Angeles Plays Itself) collaborated with film historian/theoretician No�l Burch on Red Hollywood, a documentary adaptation of their essay "Les Communistes de Hollywood." Andersen and Burch examine the work of the "Hollywood Ten," and other filmmakers and artists impacted by the infamous House Committee on Un-American Activities. While the Hollywood Ten were derided by no less than Billy Wilder as untalented, Andersen and Burch are more concerned with whether or not expressions of their progressive political beliefs can actually be found in the films they made. A fascinating wealth of clips from films like Marked Woman, Intruder in the Dust, He Ran All the Way, and Smash-Up are analyzed for the (sometimes admittedly na�ve) way they address such issues of class conflict, racial injustice, and gender inequality. Andersen and Burch also deliver a cursory history of the blacklist and its aftereffects, and include later interviews with filmmakers Abraham Polonsky (Force of Evil), Alfred Levitt (The Boy With Green Hair), and Paul Jarrico (Tom, Dick and Harry). ~ Josh Ralske, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <Duration>98</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Hi-8 (Horror Independent 8), is a one-of-a-kind, eight-part anthology that brings together some of the most recognized names in shot on video horror from the past 30 years, capturing the creative essence of the golden era of SOV horror filmmaking. Directors including Tim Ritter, Brad Sykes, Donald Farmer, Todd Sheets, Chris Seaver, Ron Bonk, and Marcus Koch were each challenged to go back to their roots, using only analog equipment while tapping into their decades of experience to tell fresh stories with a dark edge. Like the V/H/S series, Hi-8 brings together the leading genre independent filmmakers from across the country to spin tales of terror on tape.</StoryLine>

        <Title>Altina</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>120</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Altina Schinasi, (1907 - 1999), was a paradox. Simultaneously seductive and reserved, her sheltered upbringing was in sharp contrast to the bold sexuality of her artwork, and she created a fashion sensation in the 1930s with her design for Harlequin eyeglasses. Altina is an affecting, provocative, and richly informative documentary about an American trendsetter-a woman before her time. Free of academic constraints and confident in her keen intellect, she crafted fragments of her life into sculptures that defined her surreal and original world. Her whimsical art was also anchored in social issues: her film on George Grosz took on the Holocaust, earning her an Oscar nomination and winning her the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. She befriended Martin Luther King Jr. and supported his struggle. And during the Red Scare, she did not hesitate to hide John Berry-who was blacklisted for having directed a documentary on the Hollywood Ten-in her Beverly Hills home. As a sculptor, her most original creations were called "chairacters." Exuding Altina's unencumbered feminist sexuality, these large, almost life-size chairs and benches depicted lovers in passionate embrace or turning away from each other to express the absence of love.

            <Review>This curiously intimate documentary about artist Altina Schinasi, as told through her myriad marriages, engrosses in its own fittingly slapdash way.</Review>
            <Review>An absorbing look at wealth, privilege, creativity and progressive thinking.</Review>
            <Review>To Ms. Schinasi's credit, two of her husbands break down in tears on camera while talking about her, and the other two are dead.</Review>
            <Review>A joyful portrait, although it doesn't leave out some blemishes.</Review>
            <Review>Altina Schinasi was like Peggy Guggenheim-a member of the Jewish haut bourgeoisie who opted for a bohemian life in the arts. Jewish cultural history of a key but neglected figure.</Review>
            <Review>It was an amazing life, but surprisingly, it does not register excitingly on film. The approach is uninspired and prosaic, too much the work of a dutiful family member than intensely probing and revelatory.</Review>
            <Review>A frustrating tease of a tribute that seems to merely scratch the surface of an overprotected child of privilege-turned-irrepressible bon vivant.</Review>

            <Review>No kind of chemistry between the two ever arises, making their eventual romance, arrived at through pages of halting dialogue, feel particularly awkward.</Review>
            <Review>It's an accomplished, stately movie -- unimpassioned but pleasing.</Review>
            <Review>The movie's opening hour has a fascinating balance of nonsense and depth... If only Allen could keep that introspection and frippery going.</Review>
            <Review>There's a dashed-off, shorthand quality to it, as if everyone involved is going through the motions.</Review>
            <Review>Largely thanks to the intoxicating scenery and the gorgeous natural-light cinematography, "Magic in the Moonlight" does weave its a spell, resurrecting the spirit of sturdier and more inventive movies by the same conjurer.</Review>
            <Review>The cinematography is radiant, the vintage cars and costumes are elegant, and if the comedy feels laboured, it's all too lightweight to matter.</Review>
            <Review>In the Roaring Twenties, séances and swindling mediums were rampant, and their debunking, by magician Harry Houdini, was an event of interest. This is a fun movie about that.</Review>
            <Review>One for Woody completists only and a dreadful disappointment after the triumph of Blue Jasmine.</Review>
            <Review>Cinematographer Darius Khondji lends a magic light to landscape and interior alike -- it's as pretty a movie as Allen's done in a while.</Review>
            <Review>Woody Allen devotees might appreciate the piece as a fleeting glimpse into the bizarre personal life of its creator, but mainstream audiences should pay no mind.</Review>
            <Review>With little fat on the actual narrative, Magic in the Moonlight's efficient clip evokes the better pictures of that era.</Review>
            <Review>If it wasn't for Firth's committed performance, Allen's period piece would be all over the place.</Review>

        <Title>First Comes Love</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>106</Duration>
        <StoryLine>First comes love, then comes marriage, then comes baby in the baby carriage. For filmmaker Nina Davenport, that old playground song didn't go as planned. Single at age forty-one, she decides to have a baby on her own, never minding the odds stacked against her or the extra hurdles of living in New York City. Filming the whole process, she excels at candour and comedy. Think of a real-life Girls, only with more grown-up problems. Nina has spent over a decade turning her life experiences into cinematic essays, following the path of her mentors, documentarian Ross McElwee (Sherman's March) and Robb Moss (The Same River Twice). Her combined talents as a cinematographer, editor, and storyteller set her apart from the average first-person filmmaker. She develops characters and story arcs better than most Hollywood screenwriters do. In her quest for motherhood, Nina enlists her best friend Amy as a birth partner and her gay friend Eric as a sperm donor. While pregnant, Nina winds up dating the film critic John Anderson in an unusual display of sympathy between a director and a reviewer. The process of baby-making affects all their lives profoundly. Additionally, Nina struggles to cope with the recent death of her mother, who had been a source of strength, and seeks to improve relations with her father, a source of discouragement. The film taps into the zeitgeist topic of how the modern family is being re-imagined in the early twenty-first century. They say it takes a village to raise a child. In Nina's case, that village is populated by urban sophisticates who have delayed procreation for as long as possible and are late in confronting its joys and chores. Nina is unflinching at exposing her inner and outer self as a case study. She's refreshingly frank and funny about the trials that women endure in order to get pregnant, give birth and manage the early years of parenting. After watching, you'll want to thank your mother.

            <Review>First Comes Love is, before anything else, a portrait of a longing so deep that even the commandingly articulate Davenport struggles to put it into words.</Review>
            <Review>Davenport makes desultory attempts to bring in other mothers, but she is not an interviewer adept at drawing out scintillating observations.</Review>
            <Review>There are many glimmers of truth - as well as what can best be described as accidental insight - in Nina Davenport's painful but beautiful documentary about becoming a parent.</Review>
            <Review>This midlife confessional could have reached beyond the maternal cravings of highly educated, urban-dwelling singletons had it plumbed people's heads as thoroughly as Ms. Davenport's birth canal.</Review>
            <Review>By the end, this HBO presentation feels like one of those uncomfortable evenings where you visit a friend, and they bore you to death with images of their ultrasound.</Review>
            <Review>[Approaches] a hot-button issue from the most suffocatingly narcissistic perspective imaginable ...</Review>
            <Review>Davenport's diary film effectively mines the issues when facing such monumental decisions for the first hour. Then comes the baby, and the film loses direction. Davenport stops being a filmmaker and becomes a parent.</Review>
            <Review>There are some fascinating insights, particularly as her infant son makes her re-examine her childhood...but "First Comes Love" also suffers from being self-obsessed.</Review>
            <Review>But the family drama that simmers beneath is really what intrigues: the questionable quality of her parents' marriage and the disturbing truths that hint at her father's harsh, unloving behavior towards her.</Review>
            <Review>Nina Davenport doesn't seem interested in taming her unwieldy vanity, and thus her documentary reads as a Match.com profile recontextualized as cinema narcissismo.</Review>

            <Review>It's all familiar territory, but it's realized with flair.</Review>
            <Review>I think I have a touch of apocalepsy -- excessive sleepiness caused by prolonged exposure to three- and four-part series in which adolescents rebel against oppressive governments represented by esteemed actors.</Review>

            <Review>The premise seems both smart and intriguing, but the film directed by Wes Ball bears many of the cruder markings of YA fiction.</Review>
            <Review>As 'yoof' films go... it's an entertaining watch and doesn't take too much investment.</Review>
            <Review>["The Maze Runner"] never delivers on its early potential, quickly falling down a chute of one-note characters and painfully sparse storytelling.</Review>
            <Review>The real fun comes in navigating the puzzle, with solving it more the icing on top of a promising, multi-layered franchise cake.</Review>
            <Review>...neither as good as The Hunger Games nor as dull as the Divergent series, The Maze Runner has the same secret weapon utilized by MTV's Teen Wolf show: Dylan O'Brien.</Review>
            <Review>Wes Ball does a good job of establishing his world and making the maze an imposing place to spend time.</Review>

            <Review>In the best dramedies, of course, laughter and tears alternate seamlessly and gracefully, and you leave both entertained and enlightened. Alas, this isn't that film.</Review>
            <Review>Once in awhile, a reviewer's darkest suspicions about a film butt up against a sneaky pleasure in its incidental epiphanies. I confess to being conflicted.</Review>
            <Review>Occasionally, Hollywood will step forward with a family drama that actually manages to tinker with actual pain... "This Is Where I Leave You" has no edge, no darkness, no texture, no character to speak of.</Review>
            <Review>The most charitable thing you can say about This Is Where I Leave You is that it is resolutely innocuous -- a nothing of a movie, neutered and sanitary.</Review>
            <Review>Mawkish, self-satisfied and false, This Is Where I Leave You strenuously attempts to wring poignancy from its familial clashes and catharsis. More often, it's cringe-inducing.</Review>
            <Review>This Is Where I Leave You amounts to everything I can't stand about certain American movies. It gathers too many good, smart actors and gives most of them almost nothing interesting to play.</Review>
            <Review>The stellar cast is first rate, elevating whatever weaknesses there are in the material, and the overall result is an endearing, dysfunctional family that you'll enjoying spending a few hours with.</Review>
            <Review>It speaks volumes about the current shortage of this type of project that so many talented people were willing to attach themselves to a picture as subpar as this one.</Review>
            <Review>All too often, the desire of the audience dovetails with that of the characters: We really just want to get the hell out of this house.</Review>
            <Review>One recurring gag features Fey's toddler ambling around with a plastic toilet, defecating in the most unseemly of locations. There isn't a better analogy for [the] film.</Review>
            <Review>We get set piece after set piece, character moment after character moment, with few of them doing more than letting characters talk about themselves and tell each other things that we're not yet sure we believe.</Review>
            <Review>Just because the characters are well-to-do with first world problems doesn't make them less sympathetic.</Review>

            <Review>Despite occasional charming moments and a generally solid ensemble, The Skeleton Twins doesn't distinguish itself in any memorable way.</Review>
            <Review>"The Skeleton Twins" is a lovingly calibrated mix of heartbreak and hopefulness, guilt and the will to do better.</Review>
            <Review>Johnson's unfussy direction serves as a fine showcase for the two SNL veterans to demonstrate how their comic shorthand plays equally well in a slightly darker register.</Review>
            <Review>The Skeleton Twins is all the better for keeping us guessing as to its intentions, because that makes it more true to life. Sometimes you have to smile through the tears, and vice-versa.</Review>
            <Review>If a movie with suicide as a central theme can be deemed funny, then writer/director Craig Johnson has pulled it off, mixing heartache and humor and giving Wiig, especially, the opportunity to shine.</Review>
            <Review>Even with performers as likable as Hader and Wiig, and characters as likable as Milo and Maggie, sympathy should be earned. Like an cocksure banker, Johnson takes our investment for granted.</Review>
            <Review>With a commonplace technical approach, The Skeleton Twins could have used a more turbulent hand behind the camera to accompany the ups and downs of our lead arcs.</Review>
            <Review>As a dark character piece with the occasional big laugh, "The Skeleton Twins" is as much a pleasure to watch as it is to digest once its end credits roll.</Review>
            <Review>The real surprise of the film is Hader, graduating from more juvenile cinematic entries ... and giving a beautifully crafted performance that allows his knack for voice and facial expressions to shine in the stronger material</Review>
            <Review>A wonderful and brutally engrossing dramedy about family and the lasting effects of growing up in dysfunctional households.</Review>
            <Review>The Skeleton Twins makes for an engaging film that gets you emotionally involved, while also giving you some good laughs in the process, and for that intelligent mixture, it's a dramedy that's definitely worth seeing.</Review>
            <Review>Wiig, Wilson and Hader all give great performances in this movie, almost enough to lift it out of the dark emotional pit at the heart of the story. It doesn't quite make it there in this comedy about a suicidal family.</Review>

            <Review>In one way, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a triumph for producer Michael Bay in that it is equally as godawful as his Transformers: Age of Extinction and a hit nonetheless.</Review>
            <Review>It's essentially a Transformers movie - a Michael Bay production complete with mass destruction, urban panic, white-hot lighting, inane quips, product placement, explosions and, well, Megan Fox.</Review>
            <Review>I had to draw on my own ninja training and reflect intensively on the transitory nature of all phenomena, just to fend off the profound yearning for death.</Review>
            <Review>It's pretty much business as usual: one personality trait per turtle (with the most screen time for party-dude Michelangelo), lots of wisecracks, plenty of thin-crust product placement (Pizza Hut this time around), and even a last-minute cowabunga.</Review>
            <Review>Turtles fans might have been looking for their own Avengers. They get Alvin and the Chipmunks on performance enhancers and mass-market pizza instead. In Hollywood, history repeats first as farce, then as marketing.</Review>
            <Review>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles doesn't so much provide brainless enjoyment as it pummels the viewer into submission. "Shell-shocked" is a reasonable description of the experience.</Review>
            <Review>Michael Bay, using Megan Fox as bait, hit pay dirt with "Transformers." Now they've made a nice amusement park thrill-ride with 2014's 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' re-tread.</Review>
            <Review>Worth its weight in junk food.</Review>
            <Review>The failure of [the film] is not a result of irreverence towards the original source material, but rather a lack of curiosity and imagination concerning that promising title it's cashing in for name recognition.</Review>
            <Review>It has hints of heart, and one or two good sequences, but a rent-a-baddie villainy, a poor storyline and paper thin characters leave it floundering in generic action territory.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>89</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Levitated Mass is the story behind the monumental artwork of the same name by Michael Heizer, which is now installed at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. First conceived in 1968 but not technologically possible until 2012, this two-story tall, 340-ton granite boulder was moved from its desert quarry over 105 miles on a custom-built, 206-wheeled tractor trailer to its permanent home at the world-renowned art museum. Pray's documentary follows the boulder's historic journey, which caused an international media sensation as it challenged the imagination of hundreds of thousands of spectators over the ten nights it crawled through the streets of Los Angeles, defiantly provoking the question, 'is that a multi-million dollar work of art or just a big rock'? Pray captures the spectacle of it all, as well as the reactions-ranging from awe to outrage-from the crowds of people who watched it journey through LA's depressed inner city as well as through neighborhoods filled with million dollar homes.

            <Review>It's 'Shutter Island' in the Scottish Highlands with this initially intriguing, ultimately depressing Victorian-era madhouse drama.</Review>
            <Review>It may not be his worst film overall, but "Stonehearst" is Anderson's flattest film, a disappointingly shallow affair that wastes an opportunity to breathe life into a timeless Edgar Allen Poe short story.</Review>
            <Review>On the surface, Anderson seems to have all the necessary pieces for a surreal psycho pop. But the fear factor eludes him, leaving "Stonehearst Asylum" more insipid than insane.</Review>

            <Review>Shockingly flabby ...</Review>
            <Review>If you accept the grandly Gothic insanity here, there's a lot of fun to be had.</Review>
            <Review>The best way to enjoy the film is to know as little about it as possible and let Anderson take you on a dark and Gothic thrill ride.</Review>
            <Review>Sadly, this film seeks to expand the basic story - based on an Edgar Allen Poe tale - in a ridiculous fashion that lurches awkwardly from childish fantasy to sick violence.</Review>
            <Review>Stonehearst Asylum sets itself apart thanks to its source material -- it draws heavily from an Edgar Allan Poe short story -- and its embracing of the Hammer horror aesthetic in all its schlocky glory.</Review>
            <Review>Tom Yatsko's beautifully flexible cinematography, together with strong set design, helps to capture the transient character of the era, adding depth and energy to Joe Gangemi's script.</Review>
            <Review>This fin-de-siècle tale reveals the nastinesses of Victorian pseudo-sciences and psychiatry, devilishly dwelling on the distinctions between safehouse and jail, cure and torment. It also unveils the era's jittery repression of women and their sexuality.</Review>

            <Review>Michael Fassbender spends the majority of Lenny Abrahamson's irreverent comedy "Frank" buried underneath a giant plastic head, but the honesty of his performance is on full display.</Review>
            <Review>With the soulful Gleeson and a sweetly menacing Fassbender (under a giant helmet-head) at its center, the movie never loses its acerbic edge or its oversize heart.</Review>
            <Review>The whole thing is in danger of becoming arch and quirky, yet Abrahamson steers the final act of his drama toward a sombre, unhappy rumination.</Review>
            <Review>"Frank" has a wry sense of humor, the ring of authenticity and glimmers of genuine wisdom.</Review>
            <Review>There's a perseverance to "Frank" that's also uplifting, a true spirit of unity among the damaged.</Review>
            <Review>Abrahamson eventually tells us the answers, but he's far more interested in dissecting the intricacies and dynamic of a band along the way.</Review>
            <Review>Anyone who knows working musicians will be turned off by the spectacle of such self-defeating behavior. No professional musician would act like this.</Review>
            <Review>Michael Fassbender's face is not at the centre of Frank, but his evocative physical performance proves the film's central thesis: success is about a lot more than a great face.</Review>
            <Review>Abrahamson finds a wider range of emotion from Fassbender's dollhead than other directors do from an ensemble of players.</Review>
            <Review>A finely grained ensemble piece, more sober than it needed to be, and more complexly engaging.</Review>
            <Review>This is a fundamentally sad film, yet one full of slapstick, silliness, and laughter.</Review>

            <Review>Humanistic sci-fi from director Mike Cahill, insofar as it sympathizes with the human longings for both understanding and transcendent mystery.</Review>
            <Review>I Origins challenges too little and ties up things too neatly for it to register as anything more than well-made, well-intentioned hogwash.</Review>
            <Review>Big ideas can sometimes lead to great motion pictures or, as in the case of I Origins, colossal misfires.</Review>

            <Review>Although the film and the actors keep on looking good, this solemn, soppy, fantasy has nothing to say about science or faith.</Review>
            <Review>I Origins tries desperately to imbue a deeper metaphysical meaning with its narrative, but the alignment of all its concepts come off as disjointed and pretentious.</Review>
            <Review>As of yet, we have no science on reincarnation, but the science fiction is definitely getting warmer.</Review>
            <Review>Sceptical scientist Michael Pitt falls in love with spacey new age model Astrid Bergès-Frisbey, attracted by her dazzling dichromatic eyes [and] the tussle between rationalism and mysticism takes turns that are both unexpected and thought provoking.</Review>
            <Review>When it shifts away from the relationship, it really starts to feel forced. You can feel Cahill's hand leading you down the path toward another "discovery," and you can only hope the end will justify the means. Put simply, it doesn't.</Review>
            <Review>Shame then that it lets itself down with some iffy dialogue and a slightly anticlimactic ending.</Review>
            <Review>Though not every element of the grander mystery story works, there's plenty here to keep you thinking.</Review>

            <Review>Dementedly enjoyable ...</Review>
            <Review>As bad-taste splatter comedies go, "Dead Snow 2" is one of the more charitably nutty ones, less about gorging on gore than reveling in how silly the whole genre can be.</Review>
            <Review>The makers of "Dead Snow 2" rely heavily on the inherent absurdity of their film's premise, and expect you to do the rest.</Review>
            <Review>If the movie's hilariously cruel treatment of the halt and the lame upsets you, you can enjoy the crisp cinematography, operatically repulsive effects and frequently witty dialogue.</Review>
            <Review>Dead Snow 2 has its share of fun, goofy, gory moments...Half the budget must have gone for fake intestines.</Review>
            <Review>This grudge match plays like a generic zombie free-for-all, though Wirkola now has the money to shift from a chintzy Evil Dead homage to an elaborate Dead Alive homage.</Review>
            <Review>Dead Snow 2, is certainly not a perfect film, but it ultimately manages to equal the fun factor of its predecessor, which is by no means an easy task.</Review>
            <Review>Dead Snow 2: Red vs Dead is a film that wants to make you like it, but succeeds only in making you wish you liked it more.</Review>
            <Review>A big batch of energetic silliness made for people who love zombie movies, but don't mind a little comedy mixed in once in a while. OK, a lot of comedy.</Review>
            <Review>All this is in the service of humour that, though politically incorrect and in defiantly poor taste, somehow remains too fun ever to seem in any way mean-spirited. And if it gets you laughing - and in particular laughing at Nazis - its work is done.</Review>
            <Review>Dead Snow 2: Red vs. Dead is even more fun than its predecessor, thanks to tight pacing, clever plotting, and an expanded mythology that stays true to its aura.</Review>
            <Review>Wirkola finds room for at least one good sight gag (a zombie commandant becomes frustrated when he is unable to return a 'Sieg heil!' salute due to his chopped-off right arm) before he succumbs to the hee-haw bloodbath of the battle royale finale.</Review>

            <Review>When the Game Stands Tall is one of those cliché-riddled feel good movies that, by trying too hard to be inspirational, ends up as cloying and overly sentimental.</Review>
            <Review>The real-life story behind When the Game Stands Tall sounds amazing. But for all its exciting sports scenes, the movie version falls flat as drama.</Review>
            <Review>Most often in its early stages, the melodrama onscreen edges precipitously close to dissolving into a puddle of platitudinous pabulum served in the manner of a rote Sunday school lesson.</Review>
            <Review>Why must an extraordinary story beget such an ordinary film?</Review>
            <Review>A true tale of high school football achievement becomes a strained, by-the-numbers grab bag of uplift in the Christian sports drama "When the Game Stands Tall."</Review>
            <Review>When the Game Stands Tall is more manipulative than a hulking chiropractor. It's so busy beatifying its protagonist that it makes him into a grave idol rather than a man.</Review>
            <Review>The moral that football isn't everything seems inherently irreconcilable with a football movie, though.</Review>
            <Review>Mixes bland dialogue, formulaic sports-movie plot points, and vague Christian teachings with some disturbingly naïve racial overtones. The story risks inducing concussion as it pounds and thumps its message home, over and over.</Review>
            <Review>We've seen the 'Full eyes, clear hearts, can't lose' ethic before on screen, and more winningly dramatized, but When the Game Stands Tall does a good, and family-friendly, job of encapsulating Ladouceur's 'winning' approach...</Review>
            <Review>... has its share of embellishments and formulaic tangents, and turns predictable in the second half, with a more traditional structure leading to an obligatory big-game finale.</Review>
            <Review>...almost as bad as that moment in cinematic history when the real Buzz Aldrin has a conversation with Optimus Prime. Should be retitled: When the Facts Don't Matter</Review>
            <Review>A strong contender for the worst football movie ever made...</Review>

            <Review>As tiresome as the relentless, indulgent inscrutability and lack of story momentum can be, it says something for the movie's visceral power that there isn't an urge to quit on it.</Review>
            <Review>I found a few lines and images in the second half intellectually stimulating, but it wasn't enough. "Strange Color" exploited little but my patience.</Review>
            <Review>It's a confrontational fever dream film told from constantly shifting perspectives, and a chilly, dizzying trip into a genre defined by violently conflicting emotions.</Review>
            <Review>Enervatingly synthetic, "The Strange Color of Your Body's Tears" slices and dices the images and tropes of Italian giallo-style slasher films into an inert pile of style.</Review>
            <Review>What "The Strange Color" lacks is the heart that separates a good film from a great one.</Review>
            <Review>The filmmakers' command of the form extends to intentionally dopey performances and a total rejection of plot, all of which gets tiresome.</Review>
            <Review>[It] works just as well for the uninitiated, as many of the directing duo's stylish editing patterns play with perceptions not just of giallo, but cinema as a whole.</Review>
            <Review>both an immaculately crafted, highly sensual filmgoing experience, and a narrative puzzle whose intricate, interconnecting parts are best reintegrated by multiple visits.</Review>
            <Review>A difficult to decipher whodunit guaranteed to have you still scratching your head even after its confounding resolution.</Review>
            <Review>Only appreciable as pure cinematic craftsmanship, and it's a gorgeous movie, teeming with inventive compositions and wild lighting.</Review>
            <Review>The film rarely maintains an image for more than a few seconds. Everything must be rapid, colorful and artsy, but it is an intellectual sham.</Review>
            <Review>Cattet and Forzani are more interested in the imagery and textures of giallo than they are in telling a rich, comprehensible story.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>The tension of Calvary is fitful at best, and much of the movie trips into silliness, but in Brendan Gleeson -- in his proud bearing and his lamenting gaze -- we see the plight of the lonely believer in a world beyond belief.</Review>
            <Review>Brendan Gleeson delivers a typically towering yet warm performance in "Calvary." Too bad the movie's something of a mess.</Review>
            <Review>It serves as a marvelous showcase for Gleeson, a great old-lion actor who shows, in the film's many close-ups, a quiet, weary yet unbending faith, and a face on which emotion can play like a wave on the beach.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director John Michael McDonagh paints a rich portrait of the priestly life (and life in general) by concentrating on the details.</Review>
            <Review>Both the comedy and the violence are watered down by a dark melancholy.</Review>
            <Review>A dark and profoundly funny tale of an institution failing its sheep and its best shepherds.</Review>
            <Review>Calvary is both darkly comic and deeply sad. And it's well worth 10 of your dollars and 100 minutes of your time.</Review>
            <Review>McDonagh's writing talent is without question and the themes throughout are undeniably intriguing.</Review>
            <Review>The symbolism of Calvary is almost crushing at times. Nonetheless, its exploration of religious conviction is exceptionally mature and thoughtful.</Review>
            <Review>More traumatic than enjoyable, but there's great beauty in both its scenery and the way McDonagh and his cast cut through us with surgical precision.</Review>
            <Review>McDonagh's rotted-out take on the Stations of the Cross is a strange film, often hilarious yet always heavy and forlorn.</Review>
            <Review>Gleeson is just magnificent.</Review>

            <Review>With its important lessons of opportunity and hope, the sequel makes for fine family entertainment.</Review>
            <Review>Some angst away from the dolphin tank feels like padding, but there's enough bona fide narrative to please tomorrow's marine biologists and their parents.</Review>
            <Review>In a world full of cheapened, bombastic entertainment aimed at children, this modest, honest little movie feels special in its own way.</Review>
            <Review>"Dolphin Tale 2" cares about the right things: the details of marine rescue, the dedication of the individuals involved, and the lives and personalities of the animals under their care.</Review>
            <Review>Children will revel in Dolphin Tale 2 with its rapturous, lovingly filmed sequences of dolphins playing, swimming, and generally frolicking about with each other and with their human friends.</Review>
            <Review>While the kids talk smart, there is a bit of a condescending tone to the script - where some good old fashioned science might have been more effective.</Review>
            <Review>Barely there Morgan Freeman and Kris Kristofferson pick up the easiest paychecks of their careers, while top acting honors go to Mavis the sea turtle and Rufus the comic-relief pelican.</Review>
            <Review>... wholesome and occasionally moving but hardly memorable.</Review>
            <Review>A beautifully shot, powerful, old-fashioned family flick told by smart and responsible adults.</Review>
            <Review>Admirable intentions are no substitute for a compelling storyline.</Review>
            <Review>You can have all of the big name stars in a film that you like. But when your co-stars are dolphins, not to mention an acting pelican and an impossibly cute sea turtle, you are always going to be playing second fiddle.</Review>

            <Review>If Guardians of the Galaxy is an origin story, it is also a satire of the origin story, one that emphasizes the power of the "We" over that of the "Chosen One."</Review>
            <Review>Blessed with a loose, anarchic B-picture soul that encourages you to enjoy yourself even when you're not quite sure what's going on, the scruffy Guardians is irreverent in a way that can bring the first Star Wars to mind.</Review>
            <Review>The lightly derisive, live-action-cartoon tone robs the movie of any majesty, even of the comic-book type, and the many violent deaths of their suitable gravity.</Review>
            <Review>These meager pleasures are swallowed up in all the frantic action and overblown CG sequences.</Review>
            <Review>Chris Pratt, overflowing with charisma, plays the leader of the pack of misfits, and his blissed-out space cowboy (with a love for seventies music) is so full of good will that he buoys the film and its requisite whizbang special effects.</Review>
            <Review>Director and co-writer James Gunn brings a giddiness and a wondrous, endless sense of why-the-hell-not? possibility that's reminiscent of Star Wars.</Review>
            <Review>Action-filled and funny, Guardians of the Galaxy stakes a late claim for the summer's best film.</Review>
            <Review>For much of its 122 minutes, Gunn's grab-bag of quirky characters, genre ribbing, and incongruent '70s pop tunes goes over like gangbusters. The trouble is, it's only irreverent to a point.</Review>
            <Review>Gunn clearly knows his way round the genre and delivers a crowd pleasing summer blockbuster full of humour. Plus a raccoon brandishing a machine gun is all kinds of fun.</Review>
            <Review>Some of the other entries in this series haven't been short on humor, but this is the first one where the humor is pretty much the whole point of the science-fiction extravaganza. It proves to be a nice change.</Review>
            <Review>Gunn has certainly given Marvel another successful product, with likable actors, comprehensible motivations, and clear fight staging, set at a pace that could fairly be described as rollicking.</Review>
            <Review>Strange and tremendously engaging.</Review>

            <Review>On every level this production-from Robinson's callow performance to Vila's hackneyed handheld camerawork, punching beats in the stead of the actors-remains firmly on the level of the obvious.</Review>

        <Title>Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull's History Lesson</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 1976</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>123</Duration>
        <StoryLine>"Truth is whatever gets the loudest applause." Debunking western myths even more than he did in McCabe and Mrs. Miller (1971), Robert Altman's Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull's History Lesson (1976) sardonically explores the gap between western history and legend in show biz-obsessed America. Megalomaniac "Buffalo Bill" Cody (Paul Newman) assumes the legend created for him by writer Ned Buntline (Burt Lancaster), aided and abetted by his producer (Joel Grey) and his publicist (Kevin McCarthy), perpetuating myths of white triumph over savage "Injuns" in his Wild West show, as audiences cheer him on and buy his merchandise. But when Sitting Bull (Frank Kaquitts) joins the troupe with his interpreter (Will Sampson), his request for authenticity threatens to throw a wrench into the proceedings. Regardless of how Bill may feel about the facts, he must bow to the preferences of the paying public. ~ Lucia Bozzola, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>It's a sometimes self-indulgent, confused, ambitious movie that is often very funny and always fascinating.</Review>
            <Review>Aspires to a cynical Brechtian snappiness, but the drama is too thinly imagined, the meanings too familiar and heavily stated, for this 1976 film to gather any real interest.</Review>
            <Review>While not one of Altman's strongest films, this cynical tale merits a look as a meditation on American history, mythmaking, and showbusiness</Review>
            <Review>Scabrous revues of myopic mythology</Review>
            <Review>Altman and crew have done the necessary reorganizing and reediting on Buffalo Bill and have created a terrific movie out of the troubled dust of what was. The first time I saw the movie in New York, it was explicit, contrived, and needed a lot of help.</Review>

        <StoryLine>A rancher, a rustler, and a regulator face off in Arthur Penn's eccentric western. As a cover for their horse thievery, a gang of Montana rustlers, led by the laid-back Tom Logan (Jack Nicholson), buys a small farm adjacent to the ranch of their latest target/nemesis, Braxton (John McLiam). When the gang leaves Tom on the farm and heads to Canada for another score, Tom takes a shine both to farming and Braxton's rebellious, strong-willed daughter, Jane (Kathleen Lloyd). The slightly loco Braxton, however, hires the psychopathic regulator Lee Clayton (Marlon Brando) to root out the rustlers. With a series of unorthodox methods (and costumes), Clayton hunts down Logan and his gang one by one, even after Braxton fires him, but Logan isn't about to let Clayton (or Braxton) make him obsolete. ~ Lucia Bozzola, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>It's one thing to come up with an idea that could change the world, it's something else to actually make something of it. Something that often separates successful entrepreneurs from folks imagine interesting things is the capital to manufacture and market a new product; most inventors, however, don't have unlimited funds at their disposal, and that's where venture capitalists come in. Many of the major companies involved in the information revolution, such as Apple, Intel and Atari, were able to move forward with new technology because they'd found investors who believed in the potential of their ideas and were willing to put their money where their mouths were. Filmmakers Dayna Goldfine and Dan Geller introduce viewers to men who bankrolled some of the leading advances in computer technology in the documentary Something Ventured, in which they share what they saw in these new and unconventional notions and how they learned from the young turks of the computer revolution and vice versa. Something Ventured received its world premiere at the 2011 South by Southwest Film Festival.</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>Robert Longfellow (Martin Donovan) is a famous playwright who can't seem to catch a break. His recent Broadway play was met with horrible reviews and an early cancellation, and his marriage is being tested as an old flame (Olivia Williams) has reentered his life during a particular moment of weakness. Retreating back to his childhood home to visit his mother (Katherine Helmond), Robert crosses paths with his childhood neighbor, Gus (David Morse). A right-wing, ex-con who still lives at home with his mother, Gus is Robert's polar opposite in every possible way. When Gus holds Robert hostage at gunpoint during a drunken reunion gone terribly wrong, the drama unfolds as social status, celebrity and the imminent threat of violence converge, building up to a climax that will leave both men forever changed. -- (C) Tribeca</StoryLine>

While Haruka values the gift, she left it in her closet for some time, only to find it has gone missing some time later. Haruka notices a number of things disappearing from her home lately, and one day she discovers why -- a strange furry creature has been swiping small items from her room, and when it tries to steal her house keys, she follows it only to be led into a curious alternate dimension, where a city has been built from cast-off items taken from the homes of others.

            <Review>A political and spiritual parable, but related with such subtle realism and incantatory rhythms that it is far more mysterious than didactic.</Review>
            <Review>If the movie's universal themes don't impress, its specific details do.</Review>
            <Review>There are moments of staggering beauty and power on display here and yet there are also moments when it seems to be ambling around with no clear idea of where it wants to go.</Review>
            <Review>More than four hours long, filmed in expansive takes with almost no close-ups and very few camera movements, Lav Diaz's "Norte, the End of History" is a tour de force of slow cinema.</Review>
            <Review>Norte is formidable cinema that doesn't shy away from exploring history, philosophy, politics and religion at length. But it's also a story of three individuals, through whom these topics gain sharper focus.</Review>
            <Review>Four hours of academic moralising could be a lot more opaque than this crafty, organic film presents them as being.</Review>
            <Review>Even though this movie is over four hours long, it presents only part of the story. A lot of its length is due to long, uncut static camera shots where little or nothing is happening.</Review>
            <Review>Diaz roots his film in the quotidian so as to make it all the more noticeable when he reaches for the transcendent, a lofty goal he frequently achieves.</Review>
            <Review>In a time when so much art and entertainment is designed to be consumed in bite-size portions with little aftertaste, it's inspiring that a mental, emotional and spiritual feast like this can see the light of day.</Review>
            <Review>Diaz has shaped his material with a mesmerizing rhythm, digital lenser Larry Manda's imagery often stunning.</Review>
            <Review>While the final hour or so of the film is depressing beyond belief, the middle section does grab attention, with Diaz creating some truly memorable moments amid the rambling narrative.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Jorge is a tranquil, middle-class family man whose neighborhood has become overrun by a fringe class of street thugs. His comparatively fortunate existence makes him the target of their intimidation one night, and a hulking outlaw robs him of his insulin needle. Jorge's teenage son boldly tries to stand up for his father, which only serves to unleash the bully's terrorizing reign of threats upon the family. Jorge and his wife, Martha, seek protection from the legal system but are subjected to civic drones and bureaucratic procedure, so they remain vulnerable. As Jorge's family suffers from fear and humiliating anguish, the situation paints him as a deficient patriarch-until he's cornered into defending what's his.</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>Why did Dorothy follow the yellow brick road? Film maker Joel Gilbert journeys across America to find out what's at the end of the Progressive rainbow - Utopia or something far worse? From the ruins of Detroit to the slums of Chicago's South Side, and from Denver's illegal immigration invasion to Newark's urban removal project, Gilbert pulls back the curtain. He confronts Progressives on his quest, and takes us deep into their political fantasy of paradise on earth. There's No Place Like Utopia is a humorous and horrifying exploration of Progressivism, amnesty for illegals, race relations, Islam in America, political correctness, and Barack Obama himself, who promises to "remake the world as it should be." But is Utopia a real destination for America? Or, does the true path to happiness still remain faith, family, and hard work - back home in Kansas? (c) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>An acquired taste, this dense Jabberwocky-ish word salad is a political allegory about a populace that's been pharmaceutically duped into believing its wretched world is wonderful.</Review>
            <Review>A half-live-action, half-animated headtrip that throws Robin Wright into a dizzying showbiz paradigm shift.</Review>
            <Review>A dystopian blend of live-action and animation that acidly comments on some of Hollywood's touchiest issues before drifting off into an existential fog.</Review>
            <Review>It's almost painful to watch the immense promise of "The Congress," Ari Folman's spectacularly ambitious experiment, dissipate into nothing.</Review>
            <Review>It's like Folman took several different genres-Hollywood satire, speculative dystopian fiction, family melodrama-and fused them into something amorphous and nebulous.</Review>
            <Review>Ari Folman's follow up to the impressive Waltz With Bashir is bold, daringly different and visually arresting, but it's also a bit too much.</Review>
            <Review>Both sci-fi and metacinematic documentary, The Congress is a hallucinatory vision of our new wired world - and yet for all its overt artifice, it locates a sense of loss that feels all too real.</Review>
            <Review>Some provocative ideas are left unfulfilled in this visually dazzling indictment of Hollywood and technology.</Review>
            <Review>Folman makes one phantasmagorical leap after another, adding a live-action coda, but the visual freedom doesn't expand the story, it abandons it.</Review>
            <Review>Weird sci-fi film that mixes together animation with live action.</Review>
            <Review>Crucial to Folman's vision of the material is Wright's star turn, and the baggage that she brings.</Review>

            <Review>Considering its novice cast, sophomore director and miniscule budget, "Les Apaches" is a solid thriller that presents a gritty look at a place where few would bother to examine - except here.</Review>
            <Review>De Peretti favors observation over plot-driven dialogue and packs a punch in a scant 82 minutes.</Review>
            <Review>A sad drama set in Corsica about class warfare, youth, and greed.</Review>
            <Review>Peretti's violence resonates. Mostly kept offscreen, it echoes ominously in the animalistic tendencies of the teens ... or in something as surprising as the bump and swoosh of a carwash.</Review>

            <Review>Ziman struggles mightily to weave hot-girl assassin shtick, trendy exploitation style and future-shock grimness: The default setting seems to be whatever you've seen in a hundred other movies (and heard - the electronic score is pure digital Muzak).</Review>
            <Review>Nasty for nastiness's sake, "Kite" drags to achieve its brief running time; you wonder whether the slow motion is an artistic device or a stalling tactic.</Review>
            <Review>A kill-a-minute gore-a-thon whose twist is so obvious your grandma Edna will see it coming, "Kite" never gets off the ground.</Review>
            <Review>Ziman pretends to be empowering his young heroine by putting a gun in her hand and tough words in her mouth. But there's something deeply discomforting about his camera's fetishistic leering.</Review>
            <Review>In a film that pits the heroine directly against the sexualization of young women, the camera's gaze itself feels awfully exploitative.</Review>
            <Review>Bloodthirsty young women are no longer novel enough that this watered-down revenger can expect us to pay attention without bringing something new to the table.</Review>
            <Review>Filled with light parkour, terrible speed-ramping, and frenetically edited combat, Ziman's film could easily be repackaged as The Asylum's ripoff of Lucy.</Review>
            <Review>It's impossible to get all worked up with a formulaic revenge story when the participants don't seem like they want to be here either.</Review>
            <Review>Every exterior is foggy to diminish how far we can see... ie how far the production design could afford to make look like a rundown near future.</Review>
            <Review>For anyone compiling a list of Samuel L. Jackson's worst films, you're in for a treat. Kite will be hard to beat.</Review>
            <Review>Dabbling in the same fetish-feminism and coldly-served revenge fantasies that made Zack Snyder's Sucker Punch such a wildly divisive work...Ralph Ziman brings an appropriately seedy but miserably downbeat aesthetic to this long-in-development adaptation.</Review>
            <Review>Worse than any Uwe Boll movie. Just terrible.</Review>

            <Review>Rise of the Planet of the Apes alone justified the advent of CGI. With it comes a worthy successor.</Review>
            <Review>For dramatic verve and emotional nuance, apes trounce people, hands down, and the movie suffers badly from the mismatch; all traces of finesse are trampled by the bombast of the climax.</Review>
            <Review>This just might be the most engrossing, the smartest and the most daring "Apes" movie ever put on film.</Review>
            <Review>For the next installment, it might be wisest to forgo our own species altogether and make it all-ape. It is, after all, the logical next step in this particular cinematic evolution.</Review>

            <Review>Once the characters go underground, things start happening. Not scary things, mind you, but things.</Review>
            <Review>The movie's signature signage - "Abandon all hope, ye who enter here" - is the only instruction we really need.</Review>
            <Review>"As Above, So Below" is novel enough to be worth the price of admission, but you'll think twice before getting back in line for a second visit.</Review>
            <Review>While the film has a reasonably engaging cast and some decent scares, the script feels like an uneasy blend of The Blair Witch Project and Tomb Raider.</Review>
            <Review>An entertainment-free sinkhole of Dramamine-worthy nonsense ...</Review>
            <Review>It just isn't scary or clever enough and doesn't really gain momentum until a last minute dash towards a toe-curlingly obvious resolution.</Review>
            <Review>It's [Perdita Weeks'] strangely believable performance that saves the film from itself, planting us firmly in its corner, often against our will.</Review>
            <Review>This movie has a truly uninspired premise and wallows in so much inanity that it might as well have been buried in the catacombs, too.</Review>
            <Review>I have seen dozens of these "queasy-cam" vehicles in my 18 years as a writer of film, and so few of them ever surpass the limitations of their technique. This is one that carves out a spot in the upper tiers.</Review>
            <Review>As Above gets lost down in the dark with its characters, rendering Dante's iconic warning equally relevant to an audience looking for original frights.</Review>
            <Review>As Above, So Below is a film that gets in its own way as much as dead ends block the paths of its characters.</Review>

            <Review>The story and characterizations never get much deeper than "We're all special in our own way." At times, the five writers borrow a little too heavily from other properties.</Review>
            <Review>Even if you allow for the the fact that the film is geared towards the 5-year-old set, it's still a pretty dreary experience, made even more so by screamingly vivid colors, uninspiring animation and grating songs.</Review>
            <Review>A weak Toy Story-esque animated film for preschool kids made with little imagination, little art, and even less soul.</Review>
            <Review>It's a fun, fantastical tale for the toddler set but may not translate to older children who are too tied up with heady video games. For adults, it may take you back to a time when crayons were king.</Review>
            <Review>This is a pretty lame computer-generated animated movie that will likely not engage kids much past the first grade.</Review>
            <Review>Cheerfully exhorting imagination, creativity and bravery in children while demonstrating none of those virtues itself, "The Hero of Color City" proves to be a dispiritingly colorless feature-length babysitter.</Review>
            <Review>It should appeal to the little ones, but there's not much here for the over-sixes.</Review>
            <Review>... might at best provide desperate parents with an electronic babysitter.</Review>
            <Review>"The Hero of Color City" was made for five-year-olds and is unashamedly derivative of "Toy Story."</Review>
            <Review>Bland, though well-meaning, animated fable.</Review>
            <Review>Gentle adventure is sweet, colorful, but not very original.</Review>

Deftly disposing of body and clues, Sanders is able to convince the authorities that Stanwyck is hallucinating. But Stanwyck persists, forcing Sanders to show his hand in a fateful climax.

        <StoryLine>A violent man learns compassion when he starts to care for a young woman in this independent crime drama. Song-hoon (Yang Ik-june) is a hired thug working for underworld kingpin Man-shik (Jeong Man-shik), whose money buys only so much of Song-hoon's loyalty. Song-hoon has a violent streak and he's not afraid to strike out against those who would turn against him or his boss, making him an enforcer to be reckoned with in the South Korean underworld. But Song-Hoon's life begins to change when he meets Yeong-jae (Lee Hwan), Man-Shik's newest underling. Yeong-jae has a teenage sister, Han Yeon-heui (Kim Gol-bi) who is as good-hearted as her brother is corrupt. Soon-hong and Yeon-heui get to know one another, and his affection for her brings out a compassionate side in his nature that he's never been willing to acknowledge before. As Soon-hong falls deeper in love with Yeon-heui, he begins considering leaving his old life behind, which is more difficult than he ever imagined. Ddongpari (aka Breathless) was the first feature film from writer, producer and director Yang Ik-june, who also stars as Song-hoon.</StoryLine>

            <Review>We will give Yang, the film's writer, director, and star, the benefit of the doubt by assuming his chronicle of relentless cruelty is not autobiographical.</Review>
            <Review>Although Yang's directorial debut is overlong and unecessarily laboured in the early section, he is genuinely bringing something fresh to the table in terms of the atmosphere he creates.</Review>
            <Review>Impressive first effort by the writer/director/producer/star this downbeat drama is sincere and authentic.</Review>
            <Review>One of the most relentlessly abusive movies you will ever see - the dialogue is a non-stop torrent of profanity, and the action consists of one brutal beating after another. Yet it cries out to be seen.</Review>
            <Review>A horribly nasty and violent drama.</Review>
            <Review>There's no denying its visceral punch, delivered convincingly with unsteady, hand-held camerawork and profanity-spewing dialogue that makes The Thick Of It sound like Yes Minister. It'll leave you breathless alright.</Review>
            <Review>Quote not available.</Review>
            <Review>As brazen as you'd expect from a film with a name that recalls an arthouse tentpole, this debut from writer-director-star Yang Ik-Joon is tonally, one-of-a-kind odd-couple movie.</Review>

            <Review>The spy who bored me.</Review>
            <Review>It's a serviceable, pleasingly CGI-unenhanced run-and-gun flick I will find on Encore Action after midnight a year-and-a-half from now and watch for 17 minutes before remembering I've already seen it.</Review>
            <Review>There's nothing terribly wrong with The November Man in a serviceable late-night cable TV sort of way but neither is there anything terribly right about it. It's unnecessary and derivative.</Review>
            <Review>The November Man is one of those thrillers that grows progressively more incoherent, and it simply isn't fast enough to glide over its gaping narrative holes.</Review>
            <Review>[An] engaging, fast-paced and ultimately ludicrous combo of espionage and mayhem ...</Review>
            <Review>A predictable espionage thriller undercut further by loose ends left dangling, November Man is worth seeing only for Pierce Brosnan's dynamic lead performance.</Review>
            <Review>[The film] very deliberately trades on whatever nostalgia moviegoers might have left for Pierce Brosnan as a secret agent, and ticket-buyers' mileage will vary accordingly.</Review>
            <Review>A few brain cells short and a handful of years too late.</Review>
            <Review>The only purpose for its existence is potentially giving film students an interesting study in overcompensation.</Review>
            <Review>A poor, poor script can zap the charisma out of any actor. Just look at what The November Man did to Pierce Brosnan.</Review>
            <Review>Directed with old-school grit and clarity.</Review>
            <Review>A throwback-y, meat and potatoes potboiler that manages to get the job done with a minimum of fuss. The nastiness is bracing.</Review>

            <Review>A slipshod comedy with Williams in default mode as a lovable grouch. A waste of a once-brilliant star.</Review>
            <Review>The actors all commit, but it's frustrating to see how little material they're given.</Review>
            <Review>The film's mix of elements of "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation" and "Bad Santa" is amusing.</Review>
            <Review>The makers of "A Merry Friggin' Christmas" sprung for the fancy wrapping but skimped on the gift inside. How else to explain the gathering of such a talented and likable cast in service of such undercooked, utterly laugh-free material?</Review>
            <Review>[A] dysfunctional family holiday comedy that squanders the talents of its impressive cast who presumably signed on merely to work with the comedy legend.</Review>
            <Review>Robin Williams shuffles around looking angry and depressed - more so than the script would justify.</Review>
            <Review>Inconsequential and forgettable...</Review>
            <Review>Some fans of the late Robin Williams may emerge to patronize this charmless, low-ball, low-wattage entry.</Review>
            <Review>Even with Williams in fine, feisty form in perhaps his final major role, it still never comes close to justifying its slender existence.</Review>
            <Review>If you've seen a Christmas movie made in the last 30 or 40 years, then you've seen A Merry Friggin' Christmas. It's a Gatling gun of holiday movie clichés played out by a cast of characters that almost do a disservice to the term "broad stereotype."</Review>
            <Review>Whereas Bad Santa was nastier and riskier, as well as more mischievously winsome, A Merry Friggin' Christmas is as curiously timid as it is morally dubious.</Review>

            <Review>One can't help but read the film-which was dropped by its studio, and is now available digitally-as an expression of everything Carnahan hates about the movie business.</Review>
            <Review>The film's absurd and often offensive humour will win you over. It's not big and it's not clever, but it will raise a smile or two.</Review>
            <Review>This marks Carnahan's sixth feature, and in many ways feels like the fitting end to his Gonzo Trilogy.</Review>
            <Review>Stretch gets off to such a hectic, abrasive start that many viewers will wish to jump out immediately. Stick with [Patrick Wilson's frazzled chauffeur], though, and his surreal escapades turn out to be surprisingly entertaining.</Review>
            <Review>Stretch feels like the dots joined from what was left on Carnaghan's drawing board.</Review>
            <Review>Stretch thinks it's so damn clever, and is totally self-satisfied with its over-written dialogue.</Review>
            <Review>Stretch offers more narration than a Morgan Freeman film festival, one of several pot holes it jumps over without a ramp.</Review>
            <Review>The film is an obnoxious cartoon version of Hollywood noir, but Carnahan has the chops to keep it moving quickly.</Review>
            <Review>Stretch is a bold, bonkers and completely brilliant blast of creative energy from Joe Carnahan at his most gleefully unrestrained.</Review>
            <Review>Incredible amounts of fun, with a ferocious sense of humor and attention to pace and character connection that maintains a smooth, silly viewing experience with the occasional acid splash to identify it as a Carnahan picture.</Review>
            <Review>"Stretch" is a truly enjoyable oddity, a movie that was too brash, too weird, too idiosyncratic for a major release, but one that should settle into a nice, long shelf life. "Stretch" is a wild ride, and one very much worth going on.</Review>
            <Review>While the movie does eventually ramp up to a terrific purr, it hits plenty of speed bumps in its opening.</Review>

            <Review>Slapdash, with dialogue and plot points that were cliches in Dickens' era, the pic sends up, then reaffirms, all the values the media sell us each holiday: compassion, forgiveness, tolerance.</Review>
            <Review>The humor seems sour and perfunctory from the start.</Review>
            <Review>When Madea is onscreen, at least you know what universe you are in, and there is something interesting and insane to watch. Otherwise, you are thrust into an abyss of meaninglessness ...</Review>
            <Review>You can see, and hear, the clanking of his melodramatic machinery - the gears and pulleys of emotion - but by the time the movie is over, you've been wedged into those gears; they have you.</Review>
            <Review>The problem is the treatment of racism breaks no new ground and represents the issues in the simplest most condescending form.</Review>
            <Review>A toned down, crassly calculated attempt to expand the brand to a wider audience (see also: white people) and everybody is on their best behavior.</Review>
            <Review>Here's the simple truth: If you like the character of Madea, who is filmmaker Tyler Perry in drag, you will like Perry's 'A Madea Christmas.' If you don't, or if you haven't 'met' Madea yet, then this probably isn't for you.</Review>
            <Review>Perry's well-worn, play-to-the-nosebleeds schtick drowns out anything as far as basic craft.</Review>
            <Review>Madea has some good line as does Larry the Cable Guy. The movie isn't laugh riot but it has some laughs and it also has a good message.</Review>
            <Review>Rather than rising above the fray, Madea is very much the fray itself.</Review>

            <Review>The movie borrows so liberally from other action films that it starts to feel at times a bit like a BuzzFeed listicle.</Review>
            <Review>At this point, the Expendables have formed and reformed so many times they're like the world's most macho wife swap, the action version of Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice.</Review>
            <Review>A wasted opportunity.</Review>
            <Review>For a variety of reasons, most having to do with a weak screenplay and poor pacing, The Expendables 3 is the least successful entry in the series.</Review>
            <Review>The series did reignite a few careers and bring forth one decent popcorn movie (The Expendables 2). Rather than artificially extend its life, maybe the time has come to say Rest in Peace.</Review>
            <Review>The Expendables 3, trading on our affection for action stars of the past, has officially worn out its already shaky welcome.</Review>
            <Review>Is The Expendables 3 any good? In its own way, I suppose. It's occasionally quite fun, though the final action sequence is oppressively long and a bit monotonous.</Review>
            <Review>The action pieces are huge and impressive but it's all bang and no flash - that is, it's about explosions rather than exposition. You won't learn anything about the nuances of acting or the futility of war, but you may get a headache.</Review>
            <Review>Its most interesting lines are on the foreheads of its stars, more than ever imbuing the film with the kind of world weariness that can't be faked.</Review>
            <Review>Can we all agree that three of these is enough?</Review>
            <Review>The Expendables 2 (2012) was somehow a marked improvement, with better action and more downtime between characters ... but it was less of a hit. And now THE EXPENDABLES 3 moves back in the wrong direction again.</Review>
            <Review>And I'm the guy who usually likes this kind of crap.</Review>

            <Review>What If doesn't take too many surprising turns to get where you know it's going to go, but it handles each turn with consummate professionalism.</Review>
            <Review>If this all sounds a bit unromantic, What If certainly shows true love is difficult. For this boy and girl, falling hard for someone is a choice rather than a destiny.</Review>
            <Review>Nerd wish-fulfillment of the first order, this Canadian rom-com places an artificial barrier between its cute-as-a-button leads and asks us to stick around for an hour and a half until it's artificially removed.</Review>
            <Review>Long before the script permits the characters to acknowledge the obvious, you lose patience: Jump into the deep end of the bed already. It would be more fun and friendly to all concerned, especially the audience.</Review>
            <Review>The dialogue is believable and funny, even if strays a little too often into the grotesque eating and toilet habits of the late Elvis Presley.</Review>
            <Review>For a kid who grew up in public and is worth an estimated 60 million, Daniel Radcliffe does a convincing job of playing a normal guy.</Review>
            <Review>While it won't teach you much more about love other than the perfect recipe for a deep-fried peanut butter sandwich, it will make you feel warm and fuzzy for a little while.</Review>
            <Review>What If is a quaint bit of real life infused with the usual rom/com quirks.</Review>
            <Review>The picture flirts with the clichés, but skillfully avoids the worst of them, while going into unexpected territory, both comically and dramatically.</Review>
            <Review>It's a picture with close to zero new ideas, but it gets the old ideas so right that no one is likely to care.</Review>
            <Review>Rafe Spall makes an enjoyably obnoxious fall guy - literally so, in one farcical, very funny scene.</Review>
            <Review>The engaging lead performances and wit between the lines make the movie's winning parts outweigh the contrived parts.</Review>

            <Review>Raymond Chandler's sentimental foolishness is the taking-off place for Robert Altman's heady, whirling sideshow of a movie, set in the early-seventies L.A. of the stoned sensibility.</Review>
            <Review>It tries to be all genre and no story, and it almost works.</Review>
            <Review>[Altman] attempts the impossible and pulls it off.</Review>
            <Review>... one of those movies that always flits through my mind when someone asks me to name my favorite movies of all time. I usually don't mention it, but it's always there, on the periphery. It's at least one of my two or three favorite Altmans.</Review>
            <Review>The Long Goodbye as a whole peels back the surfaces of private-eye stories, paying special attention to their macho bluster and abused women.</Review>
            <Review>A playful de-romanticizing of the detective genre...</Review>
            <Review>Robert Altman orchestrates a jangly genre autopsy, mischievous and brutal</Review>
            <Review>A reminder that meaning, if it is to be found at all, is not always revealed through a linear assessment of hints and clues, but simply stumbled upon.</Review>
            <Review>The look, the unconventional cast and the unconventional story make this a unique film, one of Altman's best.</Review>
            <Review>Robert Altman's labyrinthine take on the Raymond Chandler classic is noir unburdened by a straight narrative - it's a triumph of atmosphere and attitude, a swiftly unfolding whodunit punctuated by subversive absurdities and shattering acts of violence.</Review>
            <Review>Quote not available.</Review>
            <Review>Stunning work of genius, one of Altman's best, and a landmark film noir.</Review>

        <Duration>93</Duration>
        <StoryLine>In 1953, the ascent of Everest remained the last of earth's great challenges. Standing at over 29,000ft, the world's highest mountain posed a fearsome challenge and had already claimed thirteen lives in previous expeditions. Faced with treacherous winds, sub-zero temperatures and battling altitude sickness, Edmund Hillary, a modest bee-keeper and keen mountaineer from Auckland, New Zealand, and the very experienced Sherpa, Tenzing Norgay, of Nepal,finally achieved the impossible and became the first men to stand atop Everest. It was an event that stunned the world and defined an era. Hillary and Tenzing carried the hopes and dreams of the United Kingdom, New Zealand, the people of the Himalayas and the entire British Empire on their shoulders. As the world slowly recovered from the horrors of World War II their efforts allowed people everywhere to believe a new age was dawning. For the first time, and with the support of the Hillary family, Sir Edmund's story is brought to life on the big screen, 'relived' using both original footage, photographs and newsreels as well as dramatized reconstructions of the ascent in 3D.(C) IFC Films</StoryLine>

            <Review>Recalled in the somewhat breathless History Channel-style voice-overs of the participants and their families, the journey was a triumph of guts, perseverance, endurance, ingenuity and teamwork.</Review>
            <Review>This absorbing account of the first recorded summit of the world's highest mountain is a rare documentary for which re-enactments make complete sense.</Review>
            <Review>Though impressively shot, the doc is a weak advertisement for 3-D.</Review>
            <Review>Like a mountaineer grappling on sheet ice, the film's focus on performance can result in a loss of footing.</Review>

            <Review>Pooley and cinematographer Richard Bluck bring the story to life - along with the vivid possibility of death -- and the big screen is the place to see it.</Review>
            <Review>Beyond The Edge brilliantly blends archival footage and reconstructions provide an engrossing, if sometimes dry, retelling of a breathtaking achievement.</Review>
            <Review>You can't help but wonder how much more someone like Werner Herzog could have done with the story.</Review>
            <Review>...cinematography is magnificent, the scenery stunningly beautiful, and the recreations are woven into the narrative so seamlessly that they are almost unnoticeable...one of the best mountain-climbing movies.</Review>
            <Review>The film makes us admire him but there is little here of the excitement, pathos and despair that you find in the stories of climbers such as George Mallory and Joe Simpson.</Review>
            <Review>This Leanne Pooley-directed film is interesting for its historical details, [and] I can certainly appreciate that Beyond the Edge is beautifully-realized, [but its] lackluster in excitement and suspense.</Review>

Made with unique access to Hawking's private life, this is an intimate and moving journey into Stephen's world, both past and present. An inspirational portrait of an iconic figure, Hawking relates his incredible personal journey from boyhood underachiever, to Ph.D. genius, to being diagnosed with ALS (or Lou Gehrig's disease) and given just two years to live. Despite the constant threat of death, Hawking makes amazing scientific discoveries and rises to fame and superstardom. (c) IFC</StoryLine>

            <Review>For a person who is keenly aware of the downside of fame - he worries that he is known as much for his illness as he is for his scientific discoveries - the storytelling falls short.</Review>
            <Review>He talks a lot about his two wives. This makes Hawking unusually revealing, because his life has almost always been framed in terms of his mental brilliance.</Review>
            <Review>As billed, an intimate look at a genius, but the science gets a major haircut here.</Review>
            <Review>The lasting takeaway from the film is how much there is to this man.</Review>
            <Review>The focus is on Hawking's scientific achievements and celebrity status at the expense of much emotional content, but it's hardly fair to expect a warts-and-all portrait</Review>
            <Review>The movie has the typical mix of interviews and archival pictures, serving mostly linear storytelling, with hardly a frame of surprising or pretty filmmaking. Maybe creativity can take a rest when you're letting an oddly charismatic genius have his say.</Review>
            <Review>If the film feels at times like a geeky version of MTV's Cribs, it's also a fascinating telling of Hawking's unusual life.</Review>
            <Review>If you're unfamiliar with Hawking's theories on black holes and the Big Bang, this doc won't enlighten you. There's only a basic summary of his work before it's deemed too complex for anyone but cosmologists to grasp.</Review>
            <Review>It's involving, but the straightforward approach doesn't say much that we don't already know.</Review>
            <Review>An engaging documentary about the world-famous physicist that emphasizes the challenges of his personal life and the resilience of his humor and spirit.</Review>
            <Review>Hawking emerges from this as an inspirational man; with such a colossus, Finnigan could have afforded to be more questioning.</Review>

        <Title>Philip Roth: Unmasked</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>90</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Philip Roth, arguably America's greatest living novelist, turns 80 on March 19. In 1959, his collection of short stories, Goodbye, Columbus, put him on the map, and 10 years later his hilarious, ribald best-seller, Portnoy's Complaint, gave rise to the first of many Roth-related controversies in which Judaism, sex, the role of women, and the parent-child relationship would take center stage. In candid interviews, the Pulitzer Prize-winner discusses his distinctly unliterary upbringing in Newark, NJ, his admiration for Saul Bellow and Bernard Malamud, his "brutal and lurid" first marriage, and how Zuckerman may or may not be his alter-ego. Nathan Englander, Mia Farrow, Jonathan Franzen, and Martin Garbus are among those who talk about the man and his writing. Franzen in particular praises Roth for "how brave he must have been to have methodically offended everybody and to have exposed parts of himself no one had ever exposed before."</StoryLine>

            <Review>It's great to see extensive interview footage with the relaxed and funny author, but Philip Roth: Unmasked shies away from controversy and, as a result, feels a bit sanitized.</Review>
            <Review>That neither Krauss nor anyone has anything remotely unflattering to say about the subject points to the fundamental dishonesty of the work, which extends from its excessive reverence.</Review>
            <Review>It's good that Philip Roth finally let others in during the waning years of an extraordinary writing life.</Review>
            <Review>Frustratingly little light is shed on either Roth's life or his work by this series of interviews with the novelist and a curious selection of admirers.</Review>
            <Review>For some 90 minutes, it's pretty much just one guy talking. But what a guy!</Review>
            <Review>This dully conventional biography doesn't do justice to its subject.</Review>
            <Review>Admiring if less than revealing documentary about one of the great writers of our time.</Review>
            <Review>In spite of the film's exhaustive chronology, those who deduce from its title that they're in for an unveiling, or an unraveling, of a major literary figure may come out empty-handed.</Review>
            <Review>Why would Roth give himself over to filmmakers who'd make a movie as dull and superficial as this one?..Makes you long for the doc that could be made by a real filmmaker</Review>
            <Review>Sticking to what's on the page pays off, especially with regard to Roth's undervalued late novels, but also means he has [the filmmakers] just where he wants them.</Review>
            <Review>Philip Roth may be unmasked but is only partially revealed in this very personable documentary portrait of one of the leading American literary figures of the past half-century.</Review>
            <Review>Roth was dashing, charming, a little dangerous, one of his college friends tells us, but she doesn't need to say it. It's manifest, and it's still true.</Review>

            <Review>"Something happens onstage," Cave says, "where you forget who you are and become someone else." As much as any documentary can, 20,000 Days on Earth allows us to bear witness to what goes on in that process.</Review>
            <Review>The title refers to the fact that the day chronicled is ostensibly Cave's 20,000th alive, though the movie is so slowly paced that 20,000 days seems more like the running time.</Review>
            <Review>Near the end of the movie, Cave talks about living in the 'shimmering space' where imagination and reality intersect. He's talking about words and music, but he could be talking about 20,000 Days on Earth.</Review>
            <Review>An intelligent and revealing look at one of rock's last true iconoclasts.</Review>
            <Review>You don't just meet and learn about Nick Cave in "20,000 Days," you feel him.</Review>
            <Review>Singular exercise in self-indulgence, introspection and tongue-in-cheekiness by the solemn and magnetic Cave.</Review>
            <Review>[The directors] give us a filmed curio cabinet of relics and recollections akin to the video for Johnny Cash's cover of "Hurt" if he had given us a tour while singing.</Review>
            <Review>The film has a cinematic ambition to which it admirably lives up, not only in its bold structure and impressively moody cinematography, production, editing and sound design, but also in its plethora of imaginative and unconventional touches.</Review>
            <Review>Nick Cave says he isn't interested in things that he understands. Yet this distillation of the man himself -- reflective and sensitive, and inventive -- tells you much about an artist's understanding of his art.</Review>
            <Review>If you're not already a fan of Australian-born rocker Nick Cave, the hyper-stylized documentary 20,000 Days on Earth will make you one -- and increase your knowledge of and appreciation for the artistic process at work.</Review>
            <Review>It's unlikely to appeal beyond Cave's core fan base -- but they are sure to love its sheer eccentricity.</Review>
            <Review>Like his live performances and recorded works, the tortured dark figure and the aesthetics of the film bring together an intriguing three-dimensional mythological scrapbook.</Review>

            <Review>Visually inspired but thematically derivative, the apocalyptic sci-fi drama "Automata" pits humans against robots with predictable results.</Review>
            <Review>Personally, if I were you, I'd bypass it for a double feature of "Cherry 2000" and "Runaway."</Review>
            <Review>One gets the feeling of witnessing some kind of primordial origin story about parallel destinies for the human race and the intelligent machines we make.</Review>
            <Review>"Autómata" is a movie that's all look and no feel, all sizzle and no steak; while it's remarkably easy to appreciate a film with such nimble visuals, the lead-footed storytelling makes it difficult to care.</Review>
            <Review>There are interesting ideas here, but they are swallowed up in dull, poorly choreographed shootouts and other action nonsense.</Review>
            <Review>Autómata's generic urban 2044 dystopia is a realm of hazily gray CGI buildings, many rubble-strewn and abandoned.</Review>
            <Review>The dialogue and the central narrative arc do not live up to the ideas present throughout.</Review>
            <Review>This film begins well... but after a while it becomes way too ordinary. [full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Automata has some interesting ideas but is let down by its clunky script and even clunkier acting.</Review>
            <Review>Unfortunately, like some of the malfunctioning robots in the movie, Automata is a clunker.</Review>
            <Review>There may be little here that we haven't seen before, but Ibanez keeps the pace fast and manages to suggest a bit of religious allegory without bonking us over the head with it.</Review>
            <Review>Not since The Matrix, or perhaps even Blade Runner (which Automata also liberally references), has a dystopian world seemed so compelling in-and-of itself.</Review>

            <Review>If Housebound is ultimately much more funny than scary, it's because O'Reilly's pugnacious performance runs so counter to the genre's usual treatment of women in peril.</Review>

            <Review>Definitely worth getting out of the house to see.</Review>
            <Review>This New Zealand-made movie is essentially a whodunnit slasher comedy, with the laughs being stronger than the frights.</Review>

            <Review>Covers an admirable amount of genre-friendly ground before winding up with a funny, suspenseful, and kinetic third act.</Review>
            <Review>First-time writer-director Johnstone's ingenious script consistently wrong-foots the audience and shifts from one subgenre to another without ever once losing its grip on the comedic elements. It's creepy, tense and scary.</Review>

            <Review>In any movie where good people are being scammed by nefarious ripoff artists, there's the potential moment where the protagonists become so stupid and trusting that you lose all sympathy for them. That moment occurs about midway through Reclaim</Review>
            <Review>Alan White's polished but pedestrian pic mines little real suspense and few surprises from a formulaic script.</Review>
            <Review>Carmine Gaeta and Luke Davies' screenplay is constructed from plot mechanics, and the emotional stakes grow less convincing with every twist of the screw.</Review>
            <Review>A message before the closing credits cites the widespread incidence of child trafficking, but any social import is lost. This isn't activism; it's by-the-numbers suspense.</Review>
            <Review>There are no twists or even surprises, except the final realization that director Alan White is taking his culturally clueless, ineptly shot B-movie totally seriously.</Review>
            <Review>A totally routine movie that tries to combine a message about trafficked children with a lowbrow thriller about loved ones going missing in a foreign country.</Review>
            <Review>While we can all agree that human trafficking is a despicable thing, it's also clear that this amazingly inept screenplay fails to do the issue justice.</Review>

        <Title>Wisconsin Rising</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>60</Duration>
        <StoryLine>"Wisconsin Rising is up-close and personal...and political. This slice of life, a moment in movement history, captures the struggles of the American Middle Class confronting the corrupting power of money over democracy. Don't miss it." --Amy Goodman, Democracy Now! Wisconsin Rising documents the largest sustained workers' resistance movement in American history. Wisconsin was a testing ground for the nation in 2011 as big money attempted to undo basic workers' rights when newly-elected Republican Governor Scott Walker suddenly stripped collective bargaining power from the state's public employees. Wisconsin Rising catapults the viewer into the days, weeks, and months when Wisconsinites fought back against power, authority, and injustice. Happening months before the Occupy movement, Wisconsinites spontaneously occupied their state Capitol for weeks as never before seen in American History. As the story unfolds, democracy itself is at stake. The government in Wisconsin looks like a circus, as Republicans invent new laws daily, restricting citizens'--and even elected officials'--access to the State House. Our cameras are rolling on March 9th, 2011, when Republican Senators attempt to vote on the bill with no public notice as over 10,000 people pour into the Capitol, occupying its halls overnight. Dramatic footage shows Republican Senators fleeing the state capitol on a secret shuttle as thousands of Wisconsinites fill the State House and Capitol grounds in protest. Collecting more than one million signatures, the people attempt to oust Scott Walker in a recall election. He is only the third governor in American history to face a recall election and is the first survive. What will the people of Wisconsin do in the face of these perceived injustices? How will the citizens rebuild and reorganize, and what can the rest of America learn from their actions?</StoryLine>

            <Review>An action-adventure yarn wrapped around a monster-movie core, Ragnarok elevates familiar B-movie material with well-matched cultural specificity and realistic family dynamics.</Review>
            <Review>"Ragnarok" is the rare Spielberg clone that feels like it was made by people that not only know what they like about Spielberg's films, but are capable of evoking them.</Review>
            <Review>Sandemose certainly proves that fjords are strikingly cinematic, but he never fully capitalizes on the Ragnarok mythos or the Oseberg backstory.</Review>
            <Review>Bring it on, Norway. "Ragnarök" is a fantasy adventure that's really impressive. Although it can scare younger children, most of the family will be just fine with this hybrid of a B-movie creature feature and the Nicholas Cage flick, "National Treasure."</Review>
            <Review>"Ragnarok" plays like Norway's answer to "Jurassic Park." If the film is derivative of Steven Spielberg's 1993 blockbuster, the skillfulness with which the similarities are deposited is also what makes it memorable.</Review>
            <Review>Ragnarok ain't a home run, but it's a solid double, and certainly enough to cause Hollywood scouts to raise an eyebrow.</Review>
            <Review>An old school Hollywood style action adventure from a country not exactly known for them, director Mikkel Sandemose has packed Ragnarok with good-natured cinematic nods to Raiders of the Lost Ark, Jurassic Park and Alien.</Review>
            <Review>("Better than Sharknado 2!" may not be a desirable pull-quote, but there you are.)</Review>
            <Review>The feature doesn't run out of gas, but here's a rare occurrence where characterizations and performances are so engaging, it's a disappointment when they pause to engage in pure cinematic pursuits.</Review>
            <Review>While Ragnarok may lack a gruesome bite, there's a tense, thrilling, throwback adventure here akin to a second-tier Indiana Jones - with a monstrous, Nordic twist.</Review>
            <Review>Ragnarok calls to mind the late night B-grade horror flicks ubiquitous at middle school sleepovers.</Review>
            <Review>In the end, any and all potential B-movie fun is extinguished by Ragnarok's depressingly listless anonymity.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, have clearly seen their share of crappy unnecessary sequels, and want to assure us that 22 Jump Street will follow proudly in that tradition.</Review>
            <Review>'22 Jump Street' tries to catch a meta-wave on the shoulders of its stars, Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum.</Review>
            <Review>This sequel to the hit action comedy 21 Jump Street is better all around: the pacing is more consistent, the sight gags more imaginative, the self-referential jokes sharper.</Review>
            <Review>22 Jump Street is hardly fresh, but the picture has enough energy to get by.</Review>
            <Review>22 Jump Street is pretty much the exact same movie as 21 Jump Street. It knows it, you know it, and it knows that you know it. And that is why it's brilliant.</Review>
            <Review>Self-referential irony is hardly a new gimmick, having served as the underlying premise for such franchises as Scream and Austin Powers, but rarely has it been indulged with such fervor.</Review>
            <Review>The mere fact that the filmmakers are aware that they're playing the role of a wholly unoriginal cog in the corporate machine does not really excuse their unoriginality.</Review>
            <Review>Yes, the movie feels every bit the hot mess it pretends to be, but it's also as shrewd and careful a live-action sequel as you're likely to see this year.</Review>
            <Review>The film's end credits feature more unbridled creativity than most films employ in their entireties.</Review>
            <Review>22 Jump Street belongs to Hill and Tatum. Thankfully, their offbeat, odd-couple vibe is still ridiculously entertaining.</Review>
            <Review>Magnificently stupid with flashes of brilliance. "22 Jump Street" is a zany action comedy that fizzles a bit at the end, but generates enough laughter to make it a very worthwhile sequel.</Review>
            <Review>Sometimes, a successful sequel does not have to offer anything new.</Review>

            <Review>When the badass cyclones muscle into town, ripping up schools, banks and airports, the film is fairly fun. Sadly, everything else about it is, well, a bit of a disaster.</Review>
            <Review>The destruction and carnage is presented with verve and flair, making this a fine example of tornado porn.</Review>
            <Review>A visually stunning disaster-thriller that ultimately feels cheap with its perverse take on death and gratitude.</Review>

            <Review>Have we ever before seen such big-ticket escapist entertainment about the awesomeness of something that so recently killed so many of us? Doesn't it usually take longer before everyone's eager for candy spun from trauma?</Review>
            <Review>Thankfully it doesn't even last 90 minutes. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>The film is nearly poetic in its inanity, curiously masquerading as a theatrical release when it belongs in the darkest recesses of your local dollar store.</Review>
            <Review>I won't pull punches: besides the pretty realistic carnage swirling onscreen, this thing is merely a collection of clichés fit for the overwrought melodrama that unfolds.</Review>
            <Review>With calamities such as the May 2011 one in Joplin, Mo., still fresh in memory, is it ever an opportune time to turn these into entertainment?</Review>
            <Review>Into the Storm gives us not just a storm, but every single cliché imaginable.</Review>
            <Review>Though [it] is lacking in interesting characters, it makes up for it with fun disaster movie fodder and great effects.</Review>

            <Review>And So It Goes never goes quite far enough, in any direction.</Review>
            <Review>This film is the cinematic equivalent of comfort food.</Review>

            <Review>It's slightly wince-worthy that lesser talents are funnier than Rob Reiner these days. He needs to get the eye of the tiger back or hang up the gloves and throw in the towel.</Review>
            <Review>Dreadful.</Review>
            <Review>The pairing of Michael Douglas and Diane Keaton in a love story for grownups yields a dose of feel-good refreshment that merits the price of admission - especially for the age 50-plus crowd.</Review>
            <Review>... has some modest charm but overall remains mired in obvious plotting and cheap sentimentality.</Review>

            <Review>Directors Nana Ekvtimshvili and Simon Gross adopt the long, contemplative takes of the new wave; much of the film feels familiar, but the location shooting and period details are nicely drawn, a result of Ekvtimshvili's autobiographical script.</Review>
            <Review>The viewer becomes keenly aware that she is only getting part of the story. But when the truth is so troubling, sometimes part of the story is more than enough.</Review>
            <Review>As arthouse coming-of-age films go, this is brilliant -- smart and sensitive with a screw-you feminist streak.</Review>
            <Review>Despite the seeming inevitability of tragedy and despair, "In Bloom" remains true to its title.</Review>
            <Review>The world painted by directors Nana Ekvtimishvili and Simon GroB is almost relentlessly grim, and even the giggles of two schoolgirls get drowned.</Review>
            <Review>The film accurately reflects the girls' numbness, but it is devoid of sustaining emotional impact. Eka and Natia's full pain is oddly remote.</Review>
            <Review>The leads are played with freshness and mischief by Lika Babluani as Eka and Mariam Bokeria as Natia.</Review>
            <Review>This film out of Georgia (the country, not the state) depicts a society not far removed from anarchy, or the Middle Ages, for that matter. There's not much light or laughter in this grim tale of limited choices.</Review>
            <Review>The performances are naturalistic and severe, especially the highly volatile families, where shouting matches are almost traumatising to hear and to watch. But ... the film ends without having said enough to satisfy us</Review>
            <Review>There are moments that are powerful to Ekvtimishvili that are more likely merely glancing to the audience, but the unadorned performances and air of unease combine for a film rich in social realism.</Review>
            <Review>Portraying lives a universe away from the malls and frippery of their Western counterparts, Eka (Lika Babluani) and Natia (Mariam Bokeria) cope with food shortages, bullying, bad families, a ramshackle education system [and] forced marriages.</Review>

            <Review>(Director Michael) Rossato-Bennett and (subject Dan) Cohen struck me at times as being perhaps a little too self-congratulatory, yet the significance of this beautifully-composed documentary and the breakthroughs it depicts can't be denied.</Review>
            <Review>"We are made to age," filmmaker Michael Rossato-Bennett says about halfway through "Alive Inside," which may be the most radical statement you'll hear in a movie theater all year.</Review>

            <Review>"Alive Inside" contains a tiny revolution within its message, and will likely end up being one of the most important documentaries of the year.</Review>
            <Review>Whle it an be faulted for its shortcomings as a film and even as an argument, it's welcome for providing a glimpse of what amounts to an alternative treatment for the ever-growing number of Americans suffering from dementia.</Review>

            <Review>Few directors could say as much with as little as Eric Rohmer.</Review>
            <Review>There's a purity to the experience of watching a film so naturalistic, like living in someone else's life for two hours.</Review>
            <Review>The best films leave space for viewers to interpret the action. Here Rohmer insists on it.</Review>
            <Review>This is a movie of high innocence, set at a time in life when romantic love is still a frolic and the seaside is a balm that quells all ills.</Review>
            <Review>Astute, unhurried and gently amusing, it will be welcomed by the director's fans while serving as a fine introduction for those who know him not.</Review>
            <Review>Eric Rohmer characters never get a vacation from their personality hang-ups. Strangely, they are still good company, thanks to the auteur's feather-light touch.</Review>
            <Review>A piercingly funny work of indecision.</Review>
            <Review>The film is a welcome tonic to the cinematic landfill that gets pushed into theatres this time of year.</Review>
            <Review>[Rohmer] gives us a concept of time passed, of meals eaten, of travel and weather. In other words, these characters are talking about their lives while they live them, trying to figure it all out as it happens.</Review>
            <Review>This one perfectly captures the promise of summer love, of flings that may not lead anywhere and probably weren't supposed to, practiced by young people who believe everything good lies ahead of them.</Review>
            <Review>It's one of Rohmer's finest, brimming with his usual mix of gorgeous locations and beautiful people caught up in romantic entanglements that challenge their misguided concepts of love.</Review>

            <Review>To call Sin City noir is to misunderstand the genre, as perhaps Miller does. Each story ends pretty simply-in brutal fighting and murder-and lacks genuine intrigue or ambiguity.</Review>
            <Review>Reviewers were forbidden from posting a word about this sequel until opening day, lest we give away the shocking secret that it's a carbon copy of its predecessor.</Review>
            <Review>There are a handful of ways in which A Dame to Kill For actually improves on the first movie. Alas, none are enough to prevent it from being a substantial disappointment.</Review>
            <Review>A Dame To Kill For isn't likely to create converts out of those uninterested in the pulpy side of fiction. But it more than earns its keep in terms of lavishing love, mildly ironic as well as pretty damn earnest, on pumped-up noir.</Review>
            <Review>Miller's original comic-book frames serve narrative functions, but these movies are all grabby graphics, devoid of compelling style.</Review>
            <Review>You don't expect to be exhausted by reams of soul-sick narration and artful chiaroscuro compositions, but that's what happens.</Review>
            <Review>Sin City: A Dame to Kill For isn't for the weak-kneed. It's a punch to the gut, a cigarette burn on the soul.</Review>
            <Review>The duration between the first film and its sequel doesn't fully explain the new film's flaws, it's quite instructive when examining the reactions to them.</Review>
            <Review>With Sin City: A Dame to Kill For... you can't take your eyes off the hyper-stylised fetishism on-screen... but you'll find it difficult to remember anything afterwards. This is instant gratification, a hard drug for the eyes.</Review>
            <Review>Do your summer a favor, and plan to detour around Sin City. Unless, of course, you're determined to visit the feel-bad hit of the decade.</Review>
            <Review>The Austin, Texas-centric, green-screen addled cult of Robert Rodriguez has finally collapsed in on itself. All that's left to wonder is if anyone will bother to tell him.</Review>
            <Review>Manages to up the original's ante of stylized, gob-smacking visuals, lusty affairs, nubile babes, and brutal encounters while still feeling like the reheated leftovers of 2005.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Kill Kapone is a realistic, hyper-violent action/drama that follows gang member, Kapone through the gritty alleys of East L.A. while getting chased all day by his own vicious gang. The story unfolds when Kapone's parole agents, Webster and Ardmore wake him up early in the day to take him in for violating his parole. Unfortunately for Kapone, while escaping through one of the alleys, he comes across a vindictive dope fiend who is hard up for his next fix. Kapone denies him of his fix which infuriates the dope fiend. To get back at Kapone, Georgie labels Kapone a snitch to his own hood. As it turns out, Georgie is the one who witnesses a gruesome murder committed by gang member Marcos. Marcos, the younger brother of gang leader Crow, is the culprit of killing an innocent woman in the alley so Ardmore and Webster pressure Georgie to come up with the name of the murderer or face a jail term himself. In order to save his own ass, Georgie snitches on Marcos who then gets arrested for the homicide. When Crow gets wind that Georgie may have been the one who snitched on his brother, Georgie shifts the blame to Kapone. This sets off a long and brutal day for Kapone who will find himself running for his life while constantly getting shot at from his own people. Shot caller Crow is furious at Kapone for having him "drop a dime" on his little brother so he puts a "green light" on Kapone with a group of young baby-faced killers. Hood prospects Sick, Fresco and Blind are given the mission to whack Kapone no matter what it takes. The trio wants to move up the gang's ladder so they are intent on blowing away Kapone before the day's end. This makes it a "no-where-to hide" situation for Kapone. As a result of the 12 action packed hours, almost a dozen people are killed in the worst day for gang-related homicides in the history of East L.A.</StoryLine>

        <Title>Running Wild: The Life of Dayton O. Hyde</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>93</Duration>
        <StoryLine>RUNNING WILD: THE LIFE OF DAYTON O. HYDE examines the inspirational life of Dayton O. Hyde as a modern-day renaissance man and one of the last old-style cowboys. Through heroic determination, he is preserving part of the American West and its heritage. For the last 25 years, Dayton has managed the breathtaking 12,000-acre Black Hills Wild Horse Sanctuary in South Dakota, where more than 500 mustangs now run free - all rescued from the controversial wild horse roundups. The film chronicles Dayton's dramatic journey of challenges and successes that began in Michigan and took him across the West. Filming over the course of 11 years, director Suzanne Mitchell and her team interviewed Dayton, his family and the volunteers at the sanctuary to reveal Dayton's extraordinary life and vision to convey the emotional healing that the sanctuary nurtures in him, the volunteers, and each and every horse. He continues to fight to protect the land and reveals his current effort against a uranium mining company that is poised to pollute the water and contaminate the ecosystems that support the residents, wildlife, and horses of the Black Hills. Combined with additional footage of government-captured wild horses, the film presents a stark contrast between Dayton's success in wildlife management and protection, and how poorly the environment is managed outside of his sanctuary. This exuberant, hard-fisted, often humorous portrait of a rancher's life is told the way it ought to be told. From cattle drives, rodeos, conservation battles, wild horse rescues, personal heartbreak, and new-found love, this is the tale of a colorful 6'5" cowboy who is an inspiration and assures each of us that we can truly make a difference at any age if we try.</StoryLine>

As we learn of the tragic events that led to Brad's arrival, unforeseen circumstances threaten to tear the already eroding reform facility apart, forcing Brad to confront not only his fellow inmates and the personnel in charge, but finally his own sense of what is right and what is wrong.

            <Review>The film transcends its B-movie template with realistic performances and taut direction, yet never spares the thrills.</Review>
            <Review>For a first time feature outing, "Coldwater" is a fine effort from Grashaw, and the setting feels fresh and new. It's an original take on a coming of age, young masculinity tale, but ultimately, it doesn't quite live up to all of its potential</Review>
            <Review>The best thing about it is its star, P.J. Boudousqué, who locates a sense of terror and betrayal that the script lacks.</Review>
            <Review>It's a promising topic for a drama, and Greshaw's talented leading man carries it until the filmmaker steals it from him and destroys everything built up in the first hour.</Review>
            <Review>A punishing, predictable drama that's almost rescued by strong acting and good intentions.</Review>
            <Review>There's a compelling, perhaps important thriller to be made about dark doings at for-profit juvenile detention camps, but "Coldwater" misses the mark.</Review>
            <Review>A rather classic, but skillfully - and tastefully, despite the graphic content - executed drama that tracks the painful blossoming of maturity during a crisis of authority and morality.</Review>
            <Review>It's a grim but engaging drama and a first feature from writer/director Vincent Grashaw.</Review>
            <Review>Grashaw draws out fascinating, textured performances from his cast, notably James C. Burns as the retired marine in charge and Nicholas Bateman as a conflicted trustee.</Review>
            <Review>The horrors in Coldwater continue unchecked for the majority of the movie. It's a very visceral experience, leaving the audience no room to hide from their own discomfort.</Review>
            <Review>Teens trapped at the wilderness camp from hell act out in violent ways in a well-intentioned expose that steps on its message.</Review>

        <Duration>90</Duration>
        <StoryLine>The filmmakers have spent the past three years traveling to some of the world's most violent locales in order to make this documentary on Somali piracy, Stolen Seas. Utilizing exclusive interviews and unparalleled access to real pirates, hostages, hostages' relatives, ship-owners, pirate negotiators and experts on piracy and international policy, Stolen Seas presents a chilling exploration of the Somali pirate phenomenon. The film throws the viewer, through audio recordings and found video, right into the middle of the real-life hostage negotiation of a Danish shipping vessel, the CEC Future. As the haggling between the ship's stoic owner Per Gullestrup, and the pirate's loquacious negotiator, Ishmael Ali, drags on for 70 days, these two adversaries' relationship takes an unexpected turn and an unlikely friendship is born. Stolen Seas is an eye opening refutation of preconceived ideas on how or why piracy has become the world's most frightening multi-million dollar growth industry. (c) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>A dense, sometimes dangerous 90-minute immersion in a world where lawlessness applies to all sides and, shockingly, international shipping companies would rather pay the ransoms than address the underlying problems.</Review>

            <Review>With his much more than meets the eye pursuit of raw unfiltered truth, Payne navigates the turbulent waters of piracy, as it has been impacted by the legacy of colonialism and rebellion, and the military hardware industry profiteering also kicking in.</Review>

            <Review>Swanberg's naturalistic, improvised style lets the conflict come about organically, repeatedly putting the characters in situations to which they could react with clichés but instead go with something more empathetic and nuanced.</Review>
            <Review>This semi-improvised indie accomplishes its modest goal, which is to explore the way a vexing relationship between in-laws can yield unexpected personal growth and warm bonds of affection.</Review>
            <Review>I suppose it's because his father in this movie is played by his father, but I've never seen a better performance -- or whatever you want to call it -- from a two-year-old.</Review>
            <Review>The script doesn't just leave things unsaid but unnoticed, and the film's conclusion isn't much more than a half-hearted well, yeah, whatever.</Review>
            <Review>A slightly above average example of a kind of movie - and of a trend within movies - that needs to be encouraged.</Review>
            <Review>A quiet, serious comedy about marriage, parenthood and the everyday strains of bringing up a rambunctious toddler while struggling to sustain a creative life.</Review>
            <Review>Swanberg's let-the-camera-run aesthetic can go either way - towards self-indulgence, or overheard, naturalistic candor. Thanks in no small part to the considerable gifts of his cast, 'Happy Christmas' goes the right way.</Review>
            <Review>Anna Kendrick as a floundering, career-clueless, alcoholic, irresponsible moocher? Just no. She manages to make it work, sort of. Kendrick's magnetic, whatever she attempts.</Review>
            <Review>Swanberg has become the foremost chronicler of a generation's belly-button lint without once having demonstrated even the slightest interest in learning how to make a movie.</Review>
            <Review>Two-year-old Jude Swanberg -- a ham as chubby as a sausage -- deserves at least a few Best Supporting Actor votes.</Review>
            <Review>The writing and acting are solid. It isn't a particularly ambitious or groundbreaking film, but it is fun. It is nice to see Anna Kendrick turn it loose in this movie.</Review>

            <Review>The chillingly gung-ho darkness that Johnson lends his comic riffs would be the story, if only the director, Luke Greenfield, didn't play the movie solely for laughs, which are few and far between.</Review>
            <Review>This notion might have worked perfectly well in sketch form, but stretched out to feature length - in a film that's overlong at nearly two hours - it grows thin, repetitive and wearying.</Review>
            <Review>Let's be clear: No one should choose this movie. It's a title in search of a plot. It could also have been called Let's Be Funnier, Let's Be Directed, Let's Be 15 to 30 Minutes Shorter, Let's Be 22 Jump Street.</Review>
            <Review>"You've been watching too many movies," says a detective (Andy Garcia) during an interrogation in "Let's Be Cops." The same could be said for the filmmakers, who hit predictable beats in this disposable comedy.</Review>
            <Review>None of this is as riotously zany as it wants to be.</Review>
            <Review>Let's earnestly hope there is no sequel.</Review>
            <Review>It's hard not to appreciate the pic's devil-may-care attitude, Johnson's prickly-but-likable screen persona, and Wayans' effortless channeling of his famous father.</Review>
            <Review>Sloppy, silly and sporadically amusing, Let's Be Cops feels like one of those 90s comedies expanded from an SNL sketch.</Review>
            <Review>It's surprising how emotionally invested you become in these numbnuts, especially when the proceedings unfold in an all too predictable fashion.</Review>
            <Review>I can't adequately express how soul-sucking the crime subplot is here.</Review>
            <Review>After a fairly solid start, Let's Be Cops melts down into a sludge of sub-Sandler-esque shenanigans that slows the flow of laughs to a trickle.</Review>
            <Review>At this point Let's Be Cops loses much of its humour and starts looking like a film Liam Neeson will turn up in any time soon. That's a pity because the first half, about two doofuses playing police, is funny and occasionally sharp.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>It's no fresher than its title - a long chase movie with Cusack as master thief and Thomas Jane as his reluctant accomplice.</Review>
            <Review>You know there's something fundamentally wrong with Drive Hard less than five seconds in: It opens on a shot of star Thomas Jane sporting an absurd mop of a hairdo that might have been borrowed from a Raggedy Ann doll.</Review>
            <Review>Does a lot of revving in order to juice its jokey, violent bad-boy cred, but it never gets out of the driveway.</Review>
            <Review>Approximately as unforgettable as its title ...</Review>
            <Review>Normally, I would have no objection to being trapped in a car with John Cusack, but that was before I saw "Drive Hard."</Review>
            <Review>[It] doesn't exactly work up a sweat devising an interesting plot villains, but the badinage between the odd couple ... makes the time pass painlessly enough.</Review>
            <Review>Very disappointing potboiler that runs out of gas far too quickly.</Review>
            <Review>Delivers a goodly amount of good natured action fun but in the end suffers from being just too low-key for its own good.</Review>
            <Review>"Drive Hard" is just a bore, barely registering as a movie, which is a shame, because with the oddball cast and somewhat notable director, it could have been fun and trashy.</Review>
            <Review>A deeply terrible would-be action comedy that looks, sounds, and feels like an 80s cheap and cheesy made-for-cable movie.</Review>
            <Review>Sputtering on fumes almost from the start, it captures a well-earned checkered flag as one of the worst films of 2014.</Review>
            <Review>Feels like the work of a computer program that analyzed dozens of popular movies in different genres, then self-generated a screenplay that tried to incorporate elements from all of them.</Review>

            <Review>Simultaneously overblown and underdeveloped, "Iceman" fails equally at showcasing the talent of its star and resolving its baroque plot.</Review>
            <Review>The delirious blend of over-the-top wire work and comedy recalls the To classic "The Heroic Trio," and a sense of brash, goofy invention prevails.</Review>
            <Review>The story is unnecessarily muddled and confusing in the telling, and the athletically gifted Yen is overshadowed by largely mediocre CGI effects. Revisit the original instead.</Review>
            <Review>Iceman is an inconsistent mess that features Donnie Yen in his action packed prime but spends too much time dragging its audience through unnecessary and disgusting comedy.</Review>
            <Review>Law's lame-brained concoction aims to be, in equal parts, a martial-arts opus, low-brow crowd-pleaser and mystical history lesson; what emerges is an often incomprehensible mash-up that plays murky, amateurish and puerile.</Review>

        <Duration>99</Duration>
        <StoryLine>"Time of Eve director Yasuhiro Yoshiura is a perspective-twisting sci-fi adventure about two kids separated by opposite gravities. Patema lives in an underground world of tunnels, the long-abandoned ruins of a giant industrial complex. Though she is a princess, she is held back by the rules imposed by the elders of her clan. One day when she is exploring in a forbidden zone, she is startled by a strange bat-like creature and tumbles headlong into a void - and out into the wide open world above the surface, a place with reversed physics, where if she let go she would "fall up" into the sky and be lost forever. Age is a student on this surface world, a totalitarian society whose compliant population has been brainwashed against the "sinners who fell into the sky." When he spies Patema hanging upside-down from a tree, he pulls her down to safety, struggling with all his might to keep her earthbound as she grips on to him for dear life. Together their weights cancel each other out, and once they master the art of navigating competing gravitational forces, they set out to evade the leaders of Age's world and discover the secret that keeps their worlds apart."

            <Review>"Patema Inverted" mines a lot of entertainment value and social allegory from a pretty great concept despite being held back from greatness by a clunky narrative.</Review>
            <Review>An orphaned girl and a fatherless boy bridge opposing societies in "Patema Inverted," a delightful animated fable from Yasuhiro Yoshiura.</Review>
            <Review>The film by Yasuhiro Yoshiura suffers from many of the same flaws as other anime features - a plodding pace, broad humor, a bland heroine and snarly, one-dimensional villains.</Review>
            <Review>Yoshiura keeps the story fairly linear, while playing with perspective and composing many stunning, vertiginous images that consider the different possibilities of being at war with gravity.</Review>
            <Review>Impressive but not dazzling. Miyazaki would have given the action more thump and Kon might have gone that bit weirder.</Review>
            <Review>Unless you're jonesing for new Japanese animation, you'd be advised to reverse your gravitational pull and steer clear of this one.</Review>
            <Review>Dark anime delves into prejudice in upside-down worlds.</Review>
            <Review>If only Patema Inverted's ambitious concept and dizzying plot twists could be accompanied by characters and dialogue of the same standard.</Review>
            <Review>Yasuhiro Yoshiura has fashioned an ingenious animated fable, rooted in scientific phenomena which will stir the imaginations of adults and kids alike, challenging as it might be at times for the latter demographic.</Review>
            <Review>Patema Inverted manages to be both exciting and charming and while it may lack a certain 'wow' factor it is an assured and enjoyable piece of storytelling and looks great on the big screen.</Review>
            <Review>Spirited Away perhaps not, but we're transported to an intriguing world nonetheless.</Review>

            <Review>The movie's principal intention is to make you laugh at a loser, and revel in scenes from which polite people would instinctively turn away.</Review>
            <Review>It's obnoxious when it means to be comic, and excruciating when it wants to be moving.</Review>
            <Review>It's a rambling, pointless and labored attempt to cash in on Ms. McCarthy's fan base without respect for any audience with a collective IQ of 10. And it's about as funny as a liver transplant.</Review>
            <Review>McCarthy's performance of unself-conscious uncouthness celebrates the freedom to be undignified. And, still, it's being misused.</Review>
            <Review>Tammy is an object lesson in the art of directing, which is all it would have taken to turn this near-miss into an instant classic. Though that may be true of most mediocre movies.</Review>
            <Review>A lot of good actors are wasted in this film in bit roles, including Allison Janney, Sandra Oh, and Dan Aykroyd. The ones with bigger roles, like Mark Duplass and Kathy Bates, are wasted, too.</Review>
            <Review>It drags and it befuddles, but like most McCarthy properties, Tammy sings when she's onscreen. Worth the bumps.</Review>
            <Review>'Tammy' is a disappointment, because it asks an energetic, unpredictable performer to play it so calculatingly, frustratingly safe.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately, the entire film plays like a 100-minute deleted scene - shaggy, formless, and voraciously inconsequential.</Review>
            <Review>A good film is hiding beneath the surface of the adequate one onscreen and it's a shame when the talent involved deserved better.</Review>
            <Review>As crude as you'd expect, and not as funny as you'd hope</Review>
            <Review>With its kitschy bald eagle sculpture, its lesbian-hosted Fourth of July party and its mid-robbery salute of a war veteran ('We appreciate your service'), the latest McCarthy road trip is a celebration of American opportunity but also a muddled misfire.</Review>

        <Title>Mr. Pip</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>130</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Based on the best-selling novel, Mr. Pip is a film by Andrew Adamson (Chronicles of Narnia, Shrek) and stars Hugh Laurie ("House M.D.", Monsters Vs. Aliens) as Mr. Watts, the last Englishman remaining in a tropical village in Bougainville during its civil war in the 1990s. He begins to teach the local children by reading them Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens. Matilda, an imaginative young girl (played by newcomer Xzannjah), is transported into the story of the novel, believing that Dickens' character Pip is her friend. Matilda's "Pip" world is an extraordinary fusion of Dickens' Victorian London with the environment and people she knows on the island. This wildly imaginative hybrid place is set alongside the film's unflinching portrayal of the horrors of war. Matilda's passion for storytelling brings terror to the village when Pip's identity is misunderstood by the invading army. Ultimately, her courage and imagination must sustain her if she is to survive. (C) Freestyle</StoryLine>

            <Review>I found this film hard to embrace. Mr Watts is a strange character who seems to create problems for himself when he doesn't need to.</Review>
            <Review>Based on the novel by Lloyd Jones, the film is a visually lush, surprising, moving story that wears its unusual premise with a deftly blended mixture of lyricism and brutality.</Review>
            <Review>It will eventually find a home in classrooms, much like Great Expectations before it. However, I don't expect it to invigorate or inspire kids as Mr. Dickens' work regularly does.</Review>
            <Review>"..from a story about literature as the door to imagination and inner freedom to the brutality of ignorance and the lack of imagination, from a coming of age story to a character portrait, and a hero's journey</Review>
            <Review>I love films that surprise me and this heartfelt and unexpectedly powerful film that uses Charles Dickens' Great Expectations as a catalyst for inspiration, certainly does that</Review>

            <Review>"Abuse of Weakness" is 20 minutes of a great movie and another 85 minutes of nothing much.</Review>
            <Review>With clinical dispassion and narrative elegance, Breillat has constructed what she calls "a thriller about denial."</Review>
            <Review>The film's title refers to the French legal term for taking advantage of a person of diminished capacity. The story, though, suggests other interpretations.</Review>
            <Review>As a portrait of what it's like to be suddenly helpless, Abuse Of Weakness is never less than fascinating ...</Review>
            <Review>This examination of power, greed, emotional manipulation and simple need is gripping and powerful to behold even if you don't know the story behind the story.</Review>
            <Review>[A] chilly, dark portrait of two control freaks locking horns.</Review>
            <Review>Abuse of Weakness is ultimately to watch how someone so desperately in need can be preyed upon no matter their own intelligence, wealth, or stature.</Review>
            <Review>Huppert's performance in this film is outstanding. She's so convincing that I thought maybe she actually did suffer a stroke. She covers a range of emotions from laughter to rage in this film.</Review>
            <Review>Shot with clean, spare simplicity by the Dardennes' regular DP Alain Marcoen, this is a very simple work, almost prosaically so at times-as if Breillat wanted to purge the film of anything that wasn't strictly to the point.</Review>
            <Review>Huppert's performance single-handedly preserves interest in Abuse of Weakness, elevating the picture's askew mystery with a valuable sense of determination and, at times, despair.</Review>
            <Review>A cautionary tale depicting a shocking example of man's inhumanity to (wo)man.</Review>
            <Review>Abuse Of Weakness is the director's attempt to account for actions that seem inexplicable, and make the audience understand and sympathize in kind.</Review>

            <Review>Gondry has such an incomparable understanding of the way in which strange and unexpected sights can tickle you. What he sometimes lacks as a filmmaker is the awareness that he can tickle an audience to death.</Review>
            <Review>Mood Indigo paints a depressing picture about romance but does so with fabulous, although often-exhausting, style.</Review>
            <Review>"Mood Indigo" feels both overdone and undercooked - a hectic but sketchy tale of oddball romance that slides inexorably into tragedy.</Review>
            <Review>It's hard not to take delight in Michel Gondry and his whooshing, bendable universe.</Review>
            <Review>A mad mix of what Tex Avery, Rube Goldberg and the silent-film fantasist Georges Melies might have come up with if they'd put their feverish heads together.</Review>
            <Review>Just the first 10 minutes of Michel Gondry's latest pillowcase of whimsy, "Mood Indigo," has more invention than most of the movies you'll see this year.</Review>
            <Review>Richly told through Gondry's signature visual oddities and whimsy, Mood Indigo posits itself as something raw and intensely original.</Review>
            <Review>Amuses, and then over-amuses</Review>
            <Review>The opening scenes are filled with stop-motion animation, a mouse blowing soap bubbles and other delights; later episodes are dark and ashen. The effect is that of Pee-wee's Playhouse slowly sinking into the dank tarn that claimed Poe's House of Usher.</Review>
            <Review>Mood Indigo is, by any sane criteria, a quixotic, even ill-advised folly. There's a certain overexertion to it all-like Terry Gilliam, Gondry is always compelled to push things that little bit harder when you wish they'd been handled lightly.</Review>
            <Review>At a time when so much filmmaking is marked by rampant laziness, it's both refreshing and a little daunting to encounter a film of such nonstop invention and creativity as Mood Indigo.</Review>
            <Review>It's such a visual stunner you might well forget how humdrum a story it encompasses.</Review>

            <Review>A scattered, haphazard, thoroughly confused film that can't figure out if it's meant to be a winningly cutesy musical or a gritty narrative about life in crime-ridden 1950s New Jersey.</Review>
            <Review>Christopher Walken plays a gangster who can fix anything; maybe he should have taken charge of the film.</Review>
            <Review>Jersey Boys comes to life only toward the end.</Review>
            <Review>It's glossy and entertaining but also safe and conventional. If my father had lived to age 72, he would have loved this movie. This is your target audience.</Review>
            <Review>At times the movie version of "Jersey Boys" captures the electric excitement of the musical, but for every soaring moment, there are 10 minutes of bickering or brooding.</Review>
            <Review>Curiously moribund ...</Review>
            <Review>Like 'Saturday Night Fever,' 'Jersey Boys' is also about four Italian-American youths from the outer boroughs. Both films have hits that are still in America's jukeboxes.</Review>
            <Review>For a movie about the Four Seasons, this sure lacks spring.</Review>
            <Review>If you're a die-hard Four Seasons fan, your only complaint about Jersey Boys will be that Clint Eastwood couldn't stuff every last hit song in. But it wasn't for lack of trying - and face it, you've still got those old records at home anyway.</Review>
            <Review>Whether or not viewers respond to Eastwood's vision, that it's so clearly his is a victory in itself.</Review>
            <Review>Given Mr. Eastwood's well-established musicality, though, it's not at all surprising that it's during the musical numbers the film truly comes alive.</Review>
            <Review>Just about every directorial choice here is so clankingly at odds with the material that, as the song goes, I couldn't take my eyes off of it. It's like watching Ingmar Bergman's Grease.</Review>

        <StoryLine>With an intergalactic cast of thousands, Koji Masunari's colorfully explosive debut feature sets a new high for visual spectacle and sheer inventiveness of character design - in what has to be one of the most gleefully surreal depictions of alien life forms ever portrayed in cinema. It seems like just another lazy summer is in store for Amane and her older cousin Natsuki. Lolling about the Japanese countryside, the days are blithe and boundless. But boredom quickly vanishes when they find an injured dog in the woods and bring him back to the cabin - only to discover that he is not a dog at all, but Pochi, an alien botanist sent to Earth to track down a rare and powerful plant called Zughaan (better known to Earthlings as wasabi root). Before long, Pochi has whisked the kids away to a space colony on the dark side of the moon, an interstellar melting pot where we experience a non-stop parade of humorous alien creatures, jellyfish spaceships, dragon trains, and - if that weren't enough - a theme song from UK pop anomaly Susan Boyle. (Really? Yes, really.) The plot twists come fast and furious, and with such a glorious barrage of color and invention washing across the screen, you just want to hit pause and gawk at the wonder of what you are seeing.(C) IFC</StoryLine>

        <Title>Ornette: Made in America</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2012</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>80</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Few intersections are as potentially thrilling and explosive as the meeting of great artists from different disciplines. When Oscar (R)-winning filmmaker (and former dancer) Shirley Clarke trained her cameras and creativity on jazz great Ornette Coleman, the result was a documentary portrait like no other - kaleidoscopic, mesmerizing and well, cosmic. This meeting of extraordinary New York talents originated in Forth Worth in the early 1980s. Producer Kathelin Hoffman was preparing to open Caravan of Dreams, an innovative new cultural center, and invited native son Coleman to write a jazz piece to perform with his band Prime Time for the opening. Hoffman then set out to find a director to document the performance. Speaking with Coleman, she learned that Clarke had started a film about him back in the 1960s. So Hoffman visited the filmmaker at New York's Chelsea Hotel and the trio embarked on a three-year project that would stretch the conventions of the documentary genre in almost every way possible. The team confronted a number of technical challenges that provoked innovation. In order to end up with a 35mm projection print, Clarke and Hoffman had to invent editing techniques to handle footage shot in a wide variety of film and video media. Since she had filmed the original footage, Clarke had become a leading innovator in experimental and documentary video production. The pair decided to try out a new Super 16 film stock and hired young cinematographer Ed Lachman, based on his brilliant Super 16 work on Peter Greenaway's The Draughtsman's Contract. The structure of the documentary required creativity and collaboration. While Coleman and Hoffman were focused on making a film about the creative process, Clarke wanted to continue the film she had begun years earlier about the musician and his relationship with his talented son, Denardo. The team also hoped the film could tell the story of a poor black kid returning home as a famed composer. And to make things even more challenging, Coleman decided to create a nightclub performance, a symphony, and a chamber music piece to celebrate his Fort Worth homecoming. The documentary uses the score of Coleman's symphony "Skies of America" as an underlying script and, like his avant-garde jazz, exploits non-linear means of storytelling to bring everything together. Dazzling sound and visual editing weave together archival shots from 16mm and video; dream and flashback sequences; animation; the theories of Buckminster Fuller; North African influences on 1960s luminaries (including William Burroughs, Tennessee Williams, Paul Bowles and Allen Ginsberg); a music video; and Coleman's musings on the intellectual and experiential basis for Southern jazz and blues. And all are syncopated to Coleman's "harmolodic" score, which music critic Thom Jurek described as "dangerous and rewarding music." ORNETTE: MADE IN AMERICA opened in 1986 to a wave of enthusiastic reviews. David Sterritt in the Christian Science Monitor called it "a quirky cinematic spree that unfolds the saga of Coleman's career while visually evoking the boundless 'free jazz' flights of his unpredictable music." Don Snowden of the the Los Angeles Times wrote: "Clarke's use of rapid-fire editing, the juxtaposition of images and its non-linear story line gives the film a far more sweeping scope than a standard portrait of an artist." But sadly, Clarke soon afterwards developed Alzheimer's and in the years following her death in 1997, the documentary was rarely shown. In 2011, Milestone and producer Kathelin Hoffman Gray brought the original elements to the UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive to oversee a restoration of ORNETTE: MADE IN AMERICA. With the active participation of Hoffman Gray, cinematographer Lachman and Milestone's VP Dennis Doros, UCLA restorationist Ross Lipman (Killer of Sheep, The Exiles, Wanda) painstakingly color corrected each scene of the collage-like film. Then Lipman and Audio Mechanic's John Polito restored the soundtrack to insure that the sound quality matched the film's splendor.</StoryLine>

He's unable to get away from his past, even though the Old West is fading fast in the face of civilization -- in fact, the fading of the West is making matters worse, as ordinary folks are mostly scared of and curious about him. Additionally, he still has enemies all around, who will give him no peace; and to top it off, the only man willing to give him any kind of a job is Dan Ruffalo (Vincent Price), operator of a Wild West show, as a sharpshooter. It turns out that Cain isn't even that perfect a shot anymore, but Cain still becomes the show's biggest attraction, because people will pay to see -- or say they saw -- a killer, and that upsets young Billy (Paul Hampton), Ruffalo's other sharpshooter, who never misses but has also never killed a man either. Billy is a lot more frightening to Cain than Cain could ever be to Billy, because Billy turns out to be a psychopath. Adding to his troubles is the presence of Luke Santee (Mike Henry), a killer with his own score to settle with Cain, as well as Karma (Craig Littler), a mysterious lawyer who's been looking for him. Cain and Billy seem headed for a collision sooner or later, even as Cain tries to find peace in the company of Monica Alton (Anne Francis), an artist from the East who loves him, and who has come out West to make a new life for herself. ~ Bruce Eder, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <ReleaseDate> 1985</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>89</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Italian horror auteur Dario Argento produced and co-wrote (with director Lamberto Bava) this gory, nightmarish horror film set almost entirely within the "Metropol," a huge, cathedral-like Berlin cinema showing an invitation-only screening of a rather lame slasher film. The difference, of course, is that the cheap scares on the Metropol's screen are child's play compared to the horrors which soon emerge to lay hold of the unsuspecting filmgoers: when a young woman is scratched by part of a display in the theatre lobby, she begins to mutate into a fanged, slavering creature who then attacks other audience members, spreading the demonic infection until only a handful of survivors are forced to combat rampaging armies of inhuman beasts, making the latter portion of the film resemble Night of the Living Dead. A handful of sequels followed; there's a little "reward" for those who stick around for the end credits. ~ Cavett Binion, Rovi</StoryLine>

By investigating the stories of these songs, this illuminating film takes us on an epic tour as we travel with the power of the music through Southwest America, slavery in the deep South, and as far away as the Scottish Highlands.

        <StoryLine>Writer/director Onur Tukel turns in a hilarious performance as the monumentally lazy, socially oblivious and commitment-shy Erik Sparrow, who is dumped by his career-woman girlfriend (Anna Margaret Hollyman, White Reindeer) when he rejects her rather charitable marriage proposal. Feeling lost, he turns to a disastrous string of online dates that successively eat away at his already-deteriorating confidence until a lanky vampire turns him into an undead ladykiller. Soon, Eric is prowling the streets of Brooklyn in search of anything to satisfy both his maniacal sex drive and his hunger for blood. A collision of absurd, self-deprecating wit and existential curiosity, Summer of Blood is a hilarious horror-comedy with a clever bite all its own. (C) Dark Sky Films</StoryLine>

            <Review>If Summer of Blood is initially hard to take, the endlessly chatty Erik eventually becomes a walking gag in his own right, and its one-note charm takes hold.</Review>
            <Review>It's all mellowly funny rather than creepy, something like a stand-up conceit elaborated into scenes. But who would want to be stuck with this running monologue for eternity?</Review>
            <Review>Any 30 minutes of Summer of Blood might have me in hysterics. But the sputtering torrent of Eric's yakking proves wearying over 90: Dude's built for speed-dating.</Review>
            <Review>The vestigial desolation of urban waste spaces is nearly a character in the antic action; when the story's gears grind, Tukel gives it a metaphysical kick that lends its final arc an eerie spin.</Review>
            <Review>I admire the DIY spirit, but Summer of Blood feels like a bit of a compromise.</Review>
            <Review>The story's resolution suggests that the curse of trivial self-absorption is harder to shake off than any ancient bloodlust.</Review>
            <Review>Director-writer-star-Turkish Zach Galifianakis, Onur Tukel, pays tribute to the horror movie trope while completely upending it with the hipster sensibility so commonly associated with the borough.</Review>
            <Review>Summer of Blood sounds disjointed, and it is.</Review>
            <Review>Onur Tukel goes to great lengths to ensure you hate his main character Erik Sparrow, and with only that mission in mind, Summer Of Blood is an unfortunate success.</Review>
            <Review>Onur Tukel is able to offer a reasonably fresh spin on familiar vampire-movie tropes, giving pitiless misanthropy pedal-to-the-metal comic wit.</Review>
            <Review>Like many of Brooklyn's hipper inhabitants, Summer of Blood tries very hard to be cool, but instead comes off as strained and aloof, with a number of satiric targets it could have aimed for but just bypasses altogether.</Review>

Jacob perks up at that thought and heads to the city to prove that his modern ways are better than his dad's tradition ways. For a while he does well-surprisingly well taking huge business risks, and still making money even after his extremely flamboyant lifestyle that attracts the wrong women including seductive Laura, whose rich boyfriend Frank is often dangerously nearby. Jacob got the it all: money, ladies, prestige-but then-he loses it all and just when he things he's hit bottom the bottom drops some more-until he is eating out of dumpsters and eventually ends up in a literal pig pen.

            <Review>An especially hollow Armageddon, in which the final battle between good and evil is as flavorless and thinly structured as a Communion wafer.</Review>
            <Review>The real problem with this film is that its voiceover at the beginning is its only real attempt at storytelling; there is no central character or quest to latch onto.</Review>

        <Title>Gibsonburg</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>90</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Gibsonburg is based on the true story of a high school baseball team that had a regular season record of 6 wins and 17 losses in 2005. During the regular season they lost 13 games in a row, were mercy ruled 7 times, and lost the last game of the season by a score of 17 to 0. In a magical way, their first year coach got this same team to win 8 post season games in a row which took them to the State Championship. No team, in any state, has ever won a State Championship with a losing record. Although baseball is the backbone of the film, Gibsonburg is actually more of a coming of age film that deals with the many trials and tribulations facing high school students today. Along the road to the State Championship a romantic love story unfolds as well as a mystery that rivals any discovery that has ever taken place in the Midwest.(c) Official Site</StoryLine>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>For much of the early going it's the burdened physicality that Keener brings to the role that tells us everything we need to know.</Review>
            <Review>Jackson's spare, quietly powerful sophomore feature demonstrates an impressive control of mood and tone and the ability to tell a story largely without words.</Review>
            <Review>There's minimalist filmmaking that's quietly intriguing, and then there's emotional detachment that's stultifying to the point of being nap-inducing. War Story falls into the latter category.</Review>
            <Review>In Keener's hands, the collapse feels urgent but not unhinged, and Lee's trajectory from steely and determined to openly distraught lends an otherwise meandering film a strong core.</Review>
            <Review>Catherine Keener rarely gets the chance to grab the spotlight all for herself. That makes this turgid drama especially disappointing.</Review>
            <Review>So often does Catherine Keener play snappish or smart-mouthed characters that it's startling to see her behaving so tired and ragged throughout much of War Story.</Review>
            <Review>War Story provides a refreshingly specific, restrained story of loss and recovery in the boundaries of battle.</Review>
            <Review>Indie dramas don't get much more oppressively dreary than War Story, a film every bit as distinctive and exciting as its generic title suggests.</Review>
            <Review>Infuriatingly slow, enervating and basically empty contemplation of war's impact, and a waste of the formidable talent of a gallant Catherine Keener.</Review>
            <Review>Mark Jackson's direction strips much of the agency from any character's grasp by insisting that their dilemmas can only be revealed with stone-faced austerity.</Review>
            <Review>Exemplary actress Keener, through no fault of her own, is stuck in this sulky melodrama as a photographer scarred in war torn Libya. As for that conflict, forget about it. This could just as well be about deep depression brought on by a bad hair day.</Review>
            <Review>Mark Jackson's War Story functions as a languid visual essay that passively contemplates Lee's warped psychological state, while avoiding any exposition of the events that triggered her present state of mind.</Review>

        <Title>A Night for Dying Tigers</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2010</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>90</Duration>
        <StoryLine>An unusual family reunion brings out the worst in everyone in this darkly witty comedy-drama from writer and director Terry Miles. Ever since the death of his parents, Jack (Gil Bellows) has been the unofficial patriarch of his family, and so when he asks his younger siblings to join him for a going away party, they all agree to attend. However, the reason Jack is going away is he's been sentenced to five years in prison after being found guilt of manslaughter, and while his wife Melanie (Jennifer Beals), a successful photographer, loyally stands beside him, the victim was raping Jack's mistress at the time of the attack. Not that Jack's siblings are any less confused about life. Russell (John Pyper-Ferguson) is a published author and English professor who has left his wife for attractive graduate student Carly (Leah Gibson), and Patrick (Tygh Runyan) is a filmmaker whose recent success has only fueled his considerable arrogance, though he can't bear to break off his long-standing affair with Karen (Lauren Lee Smith), his emotionally unstable adopted sister. A Night For Dying Tigers was an official selection at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>In trying to create a balanced portrait of the conflicts and the ordinary people affected by them, director Michael Berry... chips away at the authenticity and intensity that an issue-driven film like this sorely needs.</Review>
            <Review>It captures the desperation of illegal immigrants and the confused rancor that often greets them on the American side of the border.</Review>
            <Review>The actors are compelling, and the issue is, of course, always worth discussion. It's not a great movie, but, if nothing else, Frontera is worthwhile on those fronts.</Review>
            <Review>"Frontera" is a well-cast, well-made, well-acted drama that you will probably forget about soon after you've seen it.</Review>
            <Review>You wish that a filmmaker like John Sayles had grabbed the story by the throat and teased out its complexities.</Review>
            <Review>The modern, gritty Western "Frontera" takes a lot of the clichés and delicately upends them to tell a tale about undocumented immigrants.</Review>
            <Review>I liked everything about this film, the writing by Michael Berry (who also directed the film) and Louis Moulinet, the pace, the editing, by Larry Madaras ('American Beauty') and the acting is excellent by the entire cast.</Review>
            <Review>Frontera does not measure up as an issue-oriented film</Review>
            <Review>This is trying way too hard to be Crash in the desert. The performances are dull, the story is worn out, and the film just doesn't know when to call it quits. As far as entertainment goes, Frontera is the slowest rolling tumbleweed around.</Review>
            <Review>Frontera avoids stepping on an illegal immigration soap box until the movie's final shot.</Review>
            <Review>Ed Harris brings such world-weary gravitas to his role as a grieving widower...that he comes close to making up for the picture's sometimes clunky narrative.</Review>
            <Review>It feels like an oversimplified examination of potentially provocative subject matter.</Review>

            <Review>"All In" is a lesser effort in this franchise, but not without its charms.</Review>
            <Review>Reuniting, or really, introducing, the gang is a gimmick. It's also self-destructive-cramming in all these characters chokes up the plot, and who watches a Step Up for the plot?</Review>
            <Review>It's the rare movie that knows its limitations, but also understands how to use form to best convey its strengths ...</Review>
            <Review>When the cast isn't dexterously spinning, "All In" turns into a promotional video for Caesars Palace.</Review>
            <Review>The dancing is the star of any of these movies, and Sie knows when to get out of the way and let it do the heavy lifting.</Review>
            <Review>Even by the standards of this franchise-and this genre in general-"Step Up All In" is pretty laughable.</Review>
            <Review>Step Up: All In has a few dazzling sequences, including the final dance-off, that are effective as minor spectacle, but there's never reason to care.</Review>
            <Review>Step Up isn't high art, but it is the Fast &amp; Furious of dance flicks.</Review>
            <Review>The dancing is king. So if you can't stand the heat of competition, stay out of the kitchen.</Review>
            <Review>When you remove the popping, locking, crunking and breaking from the equation, what is left is ... melodrama, shorthanded plotting, and lame characterisation.</Review>
            <Review>Step Up All In is spectacle wrapped in story, but it's the juicy delicious centre which we all crave.</Review>
            <Review>Usually these films kick off with a splashy ensemble number to get everyone in the mood but here instead there's a deliberately deflating audition montage.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>90</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Mia Medina (Ang) has finally found the perfect subject for her PhD thesis film on Alzheimer's Disease. For the next several months, cameras will record the everyday life of mother Deborah Logan (Larson) and her daughter Sarah (Ramsay). But as the days progress, strange things begin to happen around Deborah that are not consistent with any findings about Alzheimer's. It becomes apparent that there's something besides Alzheimer's that has taken control of Deborah's life. It's an evil that is far worse than the debilitating disease with which she was first diagnosed.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Everything Guardians of the Galaxy gets right with its mix of action and comedy, Hercules botches.</Review>
            <Review>The story is fairly straightforward, and, more importantly, so is much of the action.</Review>
            <Review>The battle scenes, though rousing, fall short of epic. But it's reliably fun to watch - up until the brutish, smudgy conclusion ...</Review>
            <Review>It simply fails to exploit its assets: an amusing, revisionist take on the mythological strongman, and the charisma of Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson.</Review>
            <Review>"Hercules" heaves and grunts along, interrupted by battle scenes that are visually impressive (when's the last time you saw someone pick up a horse and throw it?) but emotionally uninvolving.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is plagued by a split identity: It's half-slog, half-Mel Brooks.</Review>
            <Review>While the action sequences are decently staged, they would have been much better if I'd actually been able to see them, the film being shot in a gloomy murk which 3D does absolutely nothing to help.</Review>
            <Review>A greatest hits of sweat-drenched, sword-slinging machismo.</Review>
            <Review>The overall giddy joy of Johnson's performance is infectious and spreads out to both his co-stars and the giant battles that fill the last third.</Review>
            <Review>Director Brett Ratner's vision to debunk all of the mythology behind Hercules is a unique one, but it ultimately paves the way for a generic and often boring film.</Review>
            <Review>Johnson has a ball with the role, and there's something to be said for the exciting third act, but that doesn't make up for the sheer drudgery of the first two-thirds of the film that feature terrible pacing and very little characterization.</Review>
            <Review>The movie could use more of its surprising if intermittent wit and less of its unsurprising if efficiently staged sword-and-sandal violence.</Review>

            <Review>Questions of identity reverberate through The Dog, a documentary by Allison Berg and Frank Keraudren that chronicles Wojtowicz's storied and terribly sad life.</Review>
            <Review>There's a brashness to this documentary that sneaks up on you.</Review>
            <Review>Sidney Lumet's Oscar-winning Dog Day Afternoon was based on a true story - and John Wojtowicz doesn't even try to hide his glee in sharing every juicy, crazed detail in revealing documentary, The Dog.</Review>
            <Review>The result does justice to their subject's foul-mouthed charm and braggadocio.</Review>
            <Review>In numerous interviews that careen from profane braggadocio to tender reminiscence, the lustily bisexual Wojtowicz comes across as almost bizarrely self-satisfied.</Review>
            <Review>It'll leave you alternately amused and slack-jawed in astonishment.</Review>
            <Review>Often hilarious, poignant and fascinating, The Dog is as entertaining as movies (in any genre or form) get, telling a true story that is far stranger anything a screenwriter could cook up.</Review>
            <Review>It's comprehensive, but that doesn't make it complete.</Review>
            <Review>John Wojtowicz, filmed over a 10-year period before his death, is the star of his own show. A very flamboyant character, he talks about the loves of his life, and there were many, heterosexual, homosexual and transgendered.</Review>
            <Review>"The Dog" is insanely, endlessly watchable, a compelling human-interest documentary and a riveting true-crime exploration all in one.</Review>
            <Review>At its best when Wojtowicz is unleashed</Review>

        <StoryLine>You're in highschool. Facing the biggest day of your life. You need to nail a college interview ensuring your admittance to your parents' beloved alma mater. To keep cool when your life-long crush finally seems to show interest. And then you wake up one morning and realize someone's playing a sick joke, because you're reliving the day's events over and over...and over again. Are you A.) stuck in a dream? B.) Experiencing d�j� vu? C.) Having a psychotic break? Whether it's finding a way to get into college, into your life-long crush's pants, or having an even bigger epiphany, you must figure out how to break the cycle before losing your mind. This is the set-up for PREMATURE, the hilarious-yet-heartfelt comedy from first time feature director (and co-writer) Dan Beers that won over audiences at this year's SXSW. An ingenious collision between GROUNDHOG DAY and AMERICAN PIE. (c) IFC Midnight</StoryLine>

            <Review>Imperfect, yet energetic and complete with big laughs and heart, if you're nostalgic for the American Pie flicks, Premature will do the trick.</Review>
            <Review>Yes, it's predictably crude and juvenile, but in between the bodily secretion gags there's dialogue and performances that are genuinely funny.</Review>
            <Review>It's a bizarre and surprisingly clever concept that really makes the most of it for a lot of laughs.</Review>
            <Review>Premature is all of the embarrassing humiliation people who didn't lose their virginity fast enough felt and experienced throughout their entire lives packed into an hour and a half.</Review>

            <Review>Vivid and folksy, Fire &amp; Rescue nicely exceeds expectations dampened by last summer's stalled-out Planes.</Review>
            <Review>It is, in almost all respects, a better movie. It's still not particularly good, though.</Review>
            <Review>The meek action plays to the under-10 crowd, but the groaner puns will play only to masochists. Meanwhile, the 3-D ticket upcharge here is a big ripoff - the extra dimension is unnecessary.</Review>
            <Review>The same lame puns wedged into a succession of situations, rather than a story.</Review>
            <Review>Surprise, surprise. This "Planes" quickly grounds itself with a story that at least offers an emotional hook (if not ladder) that most adults and even kids can appreciate.</Review>
            <Review>Not only are the cliches more deftly packaged this time around, the action scenes - with long, exciting tracking shots of planes flying through valleys and over wild fires - often look like they were directed by James Cameron.</Review>
            <Review>Somehow, this sequel to a rubbish spin-off to a rubbish sequel to a so-so cartoon is actually pretty good.</Review>

        <Duration>100</Duration>
        <StoryLine>From bestselling author, Max Lucado, comes The Christmas Candle, a timeless holiday film for the entire family. Deep in the heart of the English countryside lies the enchanting village of Gladbury. Legend has it every 25 years an angel visits the village candlemaker and touches a single candle. Whoever lights this candle receives a miracle on Christmas Eve. But in 1890, at the dawn of the electric age, this centuries old legend may come to an end. When David Richmond (Hans Matheson), a progressive young minister, arrives in Gladbury, the villagers discover a new formula for miracles: good deeds and acts of kindness. While David's quest to modernize Gladbury sets him at odds with the old world candlemaker, he finds an unlikely ally in the lovely skeptic, Emily Barstow (Samantha Barks). Now, the fiery candlemaker must fight to preserve the legacy of the Christmas Candle. But when the candle goes missing, the miraculous and human collide in the most astonishing Christmas the village of Gladbury has ever seen. (c) Official Facebook</StoryLine>

            <Review>Hoffman's an actor who could do just about anything, but being authentically German is not one of them.</Review>
            <Review>One of the countless sad things about losing Hoffman is the realization that we'll never get to watch him single-handedly elevate an otherwise OK movie again.</Review>
            <Review>"A Most Wanted Man" allows Hoffman to go out with not only one of his best performances, but one that epitomizes his strengths.</Review>
            <Review>This is the sharpest, most reasonable tale of espionage and intrigue since John Boorman's Tailor of Panama.</Review>
            <Review>It was shot in dark, lurid, vital Hamburg; Hoffman is the star; and I was completely held.</Review>
            <Review>Given the deadly stakes, this should be gripping, but the film gets sucked into academic plot details, trudging through each rendezvous and stakeout.</Review>
            <Review>It drags on a little long, but you can't look away.</Review>
            <Review>A Most Wanted Man is a rare feature: a relatively smart take on the war on terror that doesn't devolve into ideological score settling.</Review>
            <Review>As their entire mission rests on the most minuscule of actions, Corbijn has crafted a smart, slow-burn thriller.</Review>
            <Review>In a spy flick, we want to see action. We want to see Jason Bourne jumping off a roof. We want tension, not realism-not smoking and meetings and yakking.</Review>
            <Review>A bittersweet curtain call for the late Philip Seymour Hoffman.</Review>
            <Review>Cobijn doesn't totally conquer le Carré's complicated plot</Review>

            <Review>As for the screenplay, by Linda Woolverton, it treads carefully, and all too kindly, in the footsteps of "Wicked" ...</Review>
            <Review>'Maleficent' is an admittedly great-looking, sometimes creepy.</Review>
            <Review>It's a technological marvel starring the world's biggest celebrity: the full weight of Hollywood spectacle incarnate.</Review>
            <Review>As a cameo, Jolie's performance might have proven spectacular; but as a protagonist, she doesn't give us enough to hold onto. For all her efforts, she remains yet another special effect, however spectacular.</Review>
            <Review>All would be forgiven if the film had more magical feeling.</Review>
            <Review>At least Disney was smart enough to cast Jolie. She has a genuinely heroic presence. If only the movie were equal to it.</Review>
            <Review>Jolie is perfectly suited for the role, letting everyone know with her eyes when she's just funnin' and when she's actually angry.</Review>
            <Review>[Disney] has learned plenty from Pixar's special move of subverting traditional perceptions of good and evil, mixing it with the love of a good origins story (à la Marvel) and with an added dash of wry humour that works for kids and grown ups alike.</Review>
            <Review>A muddy experience, both visually and thematically, although Angelina Jolie vibrates with a radiant camp intensity that demands a better, more confident movie.</Review>
            <Review>There are some Lord of the Rings-knockoff battle scenes between the evil humans and the good-hearted fairies-who live as one with nature, share everything, and need no government whatsoever ("Fairies of the World Unite!").</Review>
            <Review>Its highs are modest, but it never shortchanges its audience on spectacle or thoughtfulness or loving but frustrated nostalgia for its source material.</Review>
            <Review>An unintentional #YesAllWomen fable.</Review>

            <Review>Ethan and Sophie are never more than playthings of the premise; Moss and Duplass are the sole sources of nuance and vitality, and they seem unduly hemmed in by the movie's unimaginative confines.</Review>
            <Review>Like figures in a funhouse that is both philosophical and phantasmagoric, the characters in "The One I Love" spook you, both inside your head and inside your heart.</Review>
            <Review>"The One I Love" is a weird but gutsy exploration of what happens when we alternately idealize and find fault with our romantic partners.</Review>
            <Review>Says more about intimacy and individuality than any romantic comedy or romantic tragedy in years.</Review>
            <Review>"The One I Love" is an odd, unsettling and ultimately satisfying movie.</Review>
            <Review>There is something slightly subversive and satisfyingly spot on when a movie about love and marriage turns on a solitary detail.</Review>
            <Review>There's just something refreshing, at least for me, about going to a movie and not knowing what it's going to be, even down to its genre.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately the surreal concept is half-baked and poorly executed, which will take audiences out of the movie all leading to an unsatisfying conclusion.</Review>
            <Review>McDowell's picture goes to dark, introspective places without sacrificing the relatively light tone that works throughout.</Review>
            <Review>It is the performances of Duplass and Moss that help the film truly shine.</Review>
            <Review>at #4 on the top10 Indie films in the iTunes store.</Review>
            <Review>It's gently funny, it's compelling, the performances are excellent, and it flies in the face of conventional romantic films, always carving its own path. Satisfying, charming and recommended.</Review>

            <Review>Eenhoorn brings an understated wry quality to his performance that nicely counterbalances Nelson's unflagging bonhomie.</Review>
            <Review>[An] engaging, low-key character study.</Review>
            <Review>As a performance showcase it's intriguing simply because Eenhoorn and Nelson barely belong to the same species, so different are they in demeanor.</Review>
            <Review>"Land Ho!" is an indie oddball of a movie that wanders about with two seniors looking to squeeze a bit more out of life. The squeezing is gentle but affirming, just like the film.</Review>
            <Review>It's a visual treat, yet has little else to offer.</Review>
            <Review>A road-trip movie about a couple of guys nearing the end of life's road, Land Ho! is a sweetly simple tale that underscores what we already know but too often forget: Adventurism and finding your bliss are not just for the young.</Review>
            <Review>Land Ho!'s success is found in its small observations and flawless, off-beat leads.</Review>
            <Review>Stephens and Katz basically rely on the immense screen charisma of their two principals, which largely bails them out.</Review>
            <Review>Unassuming and amiable, this road-trip buddy comedy... belongs squarely in the sub-genre of very-low-budget American indies with untrained actors and improvised dialogue that has been dubbed mumblecore.</Review>
            <Review>In their 60s and on the road</Review>
            <Review>"Land Ho!" is a high-spirited and life-affirming film about drinking life down to the last drop. "Don't get that Sunday afternoon attitude," Mitch admonishes Colin near the end of the trip. "It ain't over with yet."</Review>
            <Review>...no huge emotional payoff here (the film's shambling nature reminds me of the Dutch documentary Ne me quite pas, about two aging working-class alcoholics), just an hour and a half of pleasant company.</Review>

            <Review>Neither the script's up-to-the-minute signifiers nor its cheekily self-aware humor can entirely dispel a formulaic feel.</Review>
            <Review>The intelligence and unhackneyed humor of the believable, unself-conscious screenplay by fledgling director Mr. Zwick (son of veteran director Edward Zwick) deserves special praise. It never hits a false note.</Review>
            <Review>I was pleasantly surprised by much of "About Alex," a film that features a stronger-than-average ensemble for this subgenre even if it too often succumbs to predictable, traditional turns of Screenwriting 101.</Review>
            <Review>The chronicle of a less self-absorbed generation, it's less annoying than The Big Chill but also less funny.</Review>
            <Review>Only Plaza's performance as the troubled Sarah comes close to creating a three-dimensional character.</Review>
            <Review>The insight that social media fosters false intimacy is old news. The film shows only a half-formed sense of how careers have changed in 30 years.</Review>
            <Review>Most of the characters are superficial and underdeveloped, while the film itself is filled with predictable scenarios. Strong performances by the cast elevate the material, but it's simply not enough.</Review>
            <Review>Perhaps we can view this in 30 years as a lightweight text mirroring some of Occupy Wall Street, and perhaps the rise of Elizabeth Warren, although I'm quite sure it will be forgotten about well before then.</Review>
            <Review>Nice to meet you, Truthteller. Meet your fellow stereotypes...</Review>
            <Review>A riff on the 1983 classic The Big Chill, this ensemble drama's reunion of old friends differs because Alex's suicide fails this time.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately, the portrayals in About Alex are all caricatures that don't really ring true.</Review>
            <Review>The whole movie feels like sitting through a monologue read by over-privileged millennials reading pages from their pubescent diary, sharing shallow revelations about crushes and car envy.</Review>

            <Review>Hogg maintains a probing detachment and a cold intimacy. As befits the title, she presents her subjects like specimens in an exhibit, with a rigorously structured style that is non-judgmental and unsparing.</Review>
            <Review>If "Exhibition" lacks conventionally developed characters and dialogue, it is visually enthralling.</Review>
            <Review>A film that's all airy, abstract pretentiousness.</Review>
            <Review>Hogg's third feature magnifies the relationship between people and the spaces they live in with a keen eye for the way the two tend to blend together.</Review>
            <Review>The whole thing teeters between very boring and completely fascinating.</Review>
            <Review>Beautifully shot with an acute eye for crisp composition, this intimate mood piece explores the subtle intricacies and low-level power struggles of long-term love in forensic detail.</Review>
            <Review>Seeing Exhibition is like spying through a window on our most glamorous neighbors moving about their flat: it's kind of kinky, kind of fun.</Review>
            <Review>It's a very brave and unapologetically cerebral approach to have taken, but it often feels like there's just too little there, too few life rings thrown to the average, non-art-student viewer, to keep us engaged.</Review>
            <Review>A house is not only a living and work space for a woman, but a reflection of her thoughts and emotions. . . as she slowly adjusts to life change through intriguing images.</Review>
            <Review>With Exhibition, Joanna Hogg advances her impressive directing style with a visually striking - if decidedly chilly - look at a couple reaching stalemate in their stifling London home.</Review>
            <Review>The importance of Location, Location, Location in the British psyche cannot be overemphasised. Joanna Hogg's brilliantly austere and intimate portrait of a marriage recognises this.</Review>

            <Review>If filmmakers were put on trial for hackery, a good prosecutor might ask director Miller why The Prince contains no discernible prince but does feature a closing-credit shout-out to "Prince Yoohanhwesa."</Review>
            <Review>Unless you're a fan of yawn-worthy shootouts and showdowns, "The Prince" is a "Taken" retread hardly indicative of any special set of skills.</Review>
            <Review>An idle Netflix user could certainly do far worse when browsing for mindless actioners. But the overall air of shrugging obligation from those both in front of and behind the camera proves contagious.</Review>
            <Review>'Taken' without any of the charisma or energy.</Review>
            <Review>Originality, either in terms of writing or direction, in in short supply in this assembly-line vigilante thriller.</Review>
            <Review>The Prince is a royal dud.</Review>
            <Review>Aggressive but hopelessly thin, The Prince hopes to dazzle viewers with famous faces, which act as a rodeo clown while the rest of the picture trots out snoozy underworld and revenge clichés in a most uninspired script.</Review>
            <Review>This isn't a passion project for anyone involved. It's a by-the-numbers affair that's landing on the right side of the ledger book. It's about mercenaries on both sides of the camera.</Review>
            <Review>Macho mayhem as the male version of maternal instinct. While Willis rather delicately negotiates his darker side, in a shaky balance between a slightly humanized professional psychopath seeking closure for a major grievance, and just a really rotten dude.</Review>

            <Review>An impressively staged climactic exorcism compensates in part for the random, far-fetched storytelling that precedes it.</Review>
            <Review>If you didn't know that Jerry Bruckheimer produced this movie, the boot prints on your eardrums would've clued you in.</Review>
            <Review>Director Scott Derrickson and his co-writer, Paul Harris Boardman, deliver a routine procedural with unremarkable frights.</Review>
            <Review>Director Scott Derrickson demonstrates a knack for atmosphere but little sense of pacing; some sequences are effectively spooky (particularly one set at the Bronx Zoo), though just as many feel uninspired.</Review>
            <Review>It's time for Derrickson, who also directed The Exorcism of Emily Rose, to master a new ritual.</Review>
            <Review>A surprisingly strong cast and solid direction make all the malarkey in this horror flick tolerable.</Review>
            <Review>Deliver Us From Evil is too glossy and loud, and too similar to other entertaining "fright fests". If Derrickson had pulled back a little he may have delivered a more convincing, original and unnerving film.</Review>
            <Review>What begins promisingly enough ends up a gratuitously violent, underwritten, depressing scrap heap of a movie that aims for two audiences and misses both.</Review>
            <Review>It's a refreshingly taut and intelligently made punch in the arm for a subgenre that so desperately needed it.</Review>
            <Review>When a plot gets so ludicrous, even the suggestion that it could happen to you won't make the film any scarier.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately, Deliver Us from Evil is a very messy affair.</Review>
            <Review>Scott Derrickson's "Deliver Us from Evil" suffers from an immense lack of originality, a bloated runtime of two hours, and pacing that makes a snail look fast.</Review>

        <StoryLine>In a small town, the body of a teenager named Jamie Marks (Noah Silver) is found by the river. Adam (Cameron Monaghan), the star of his cross-country team, becomes fascinated with Jamie- a boy nobody really knew or interacted with, except occasionally to bully him. When Jamie's ghost begins to appear both to Adam and Gracie (Morgan Saylor), the classmate who discovered the body, Adam is caught between two worlds. He has a budding romance with Gracie, but he also feels a deep connection to Jamie, who brings him closer to the world of the undead. (C) Gravitas Ventures</StoryLine>

            <Review>"Jamie Marks Is Dead" admirably refuses to hew to conventional horror tropes and is acted with integrity by its young performers, but the film nonetheless has a nagging pulse problem.</Review>
            <Review>It is likely to test the patience of many viewers.</Review>
            <Review>Temperate in tone but screaming with subtext, "Jamie Marks Is Dead" climbs above the current glut of supernaturally inclined entertainment by dint of a hushed unease that permeates almost every frame.</Review>
            <Review>The film uses its phantasmagoric conceit, a sickly-hued poetry, and eerie sound design to build metaphors for closeted homoeroticism and melancholic unfulfillment.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director Carter Smith got his start as a successful fashion photographer. But you wouldn't know it from the murky look of this generic thriller.</Review>
            <Review>The potentially ludicrous story is handled artfully enough here to cast an eerie but not off-putting spell throughout, though the ultimate point is more than a tad murky, and the desired poignancy doesn't fully come across.</Review>
            <Review>It may have more brains behind it than The Ruins, but hopefully Smith can find material truly worthy of his technical talents with his next feature.</Review>
            <Review>Jamie's death [is] a shifting, formative influence on Gracie and Adam's future life. Smith conjures this bizarre love triangle without recourse to any special effects, and maintains a wintry melancholy throughout.</Review>
            <Review>Unpredictable, atmospheric and enigmatic. This isn't your average coming-of-age film which makes it all the more refreshing, unique and un-Hollywood.</Review>
            <Review>A nifty little sleeper in the vein of DONNIE DARKO.</Review>
            <Review>It's a film that I liked more when no one was speaking, getting into the atmosphere of this world without having to deal with the awkward plotting within it.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director Carter Smith sets a brooding, chilly atmosphere, but he also writes opaquely vague dialogue and includes in a subplot involving Adam's mother (Liv Tyler) that goes nowhere.</Review>

            <Review>This ruthlessly unfunny misfire should be quickly relegated to an IMDb trivia question after a brief theatrical bow.</Review>
            <Review>Selena Gomez is adorable and manages to float away unscathed. But other than that, it's an unfunny comedy, populated by irredeemable sociopaths.</Review>
            <Review>Aside from a few lines of juicy bad language, Gomez plays the innocent in this fast-paced screwball farce, which is full of cheerful vulgarity but dangerously low on wit, charm or narrative logic.</Review>
            <Review>Behaving Badly is a contender for the worst film of the year...</Review>
            <Review>Raunchy high school comedy is a big disappointment.</Review>
            <Review>For a comedy that so desperately wants to be rude and sexy, this movie is remarkably timid. It does a great job putting up a front as an anarchic laugh riot, but the genuinely funny moments are few and far between.</Review>
            <Review>A number of really talented people make appearances in the wretchedly unfunny teen sex comedy Behaving Badly; so many that you wonder if a producer has incriminating photos stashed somewhere.</Review>
            <Review>Behaving Badly is 97 minutes in a search of a laugh, each of them so punishing that viewers are left to spend most of the movie trying to figure out what went wrong.</Review>
            <Review>One of the worst pictures of 2014, a tribute to Risky Business made by people who only read the synopsis on the back of the DVD box.</Review>
            <Review>A misfiring misadventure not even recommended for diehard Selena Gomez fans.</Review>
            <Review>A game supporting cast and a miscast leading man add up to a half-hearted randy teen farce</Review>
            <Review>Rick's ultimate journey becomes less about atonement than simply getting the girl, and moral reclamation reveals itself as the vehicle by which to peddle a bunch of people behaving badly.</Review>

        <Duration>90</Duration>
        <StoryLine>In Lady Valor: The Kristin Beck Story, former U.S. Navy SEAL Christopher Beck embarks on a new mission as Kristin Beck. Kristin's journey in search of the American ideals that she protected have a whole new meaning as she lives her life truthfully as a transgender woman. Kristin served for over 20 years as a member of the elite special forces Navy SEALs on SEAL Team 1 as well as the United States Special Warfare Development Group - what many in the public refer to as SEAL Team 6. She retired in 2011 with the rank of Senior Chief and continued high-level clearance work for the United States government and the Pentagon. But Kristin hid her true identity throughout and after her service knowing she would lose it all if anyone were to know her secret. In 2013, a year and a half after retirement, Kristin came out publicly first on LinkedIn and on CNN's Anderson Cooper 360 soon thereafter. Many friends, colleagues and family were taken by surprise. This film brings exclusive interviews from Kristin's family and friends about her service, as well as their reactions to her coming out. It also includes exclusive footage of Chris Beck in training and combat. The documentary was filmed only a few months after the AC360 piece had aired, and the truth is still fresh and emotional for those closest to her. While many people have been supportive, some in the public have expressed more bigotry than she ever expected. After a lifetime of service, Kristin has learned that her fight for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness did not end on the battlefield. (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>"America" would be simply annoying if it were just preaching to the choir; what makes it unendurable is the fact that D'Souza and Sullivan can't craft a sermon that would keep even the choir awake, interested, and entertained.</Review>
            <Review>You could bother debating D'Souza on history and semantics and rudimentary logic, but chances are you'd end up feeling like Meathead arguing with Archie Bunker.</Review>

            <Review>Hilariously, just minutes after reducing Occupy Wall Street to an assault on small hamburger shops, D'Souza attacks insurance companies and Wall Street executives as fellow travelers in Obamacare, this country's one unpardonable sin.</Review>
            <Review>It's "Sesame Street"-style show and tell, complete with highly suggestive musical cues.</Review>
            <Review>A heinously inflammatory propaganda piece that gives the documentary form and even-minded conservatives bad names, "America: Imagine the World Without Her" boils down to 105 minutes of uneducated ignorance.</Review>

            <Review>D'Souza's main problem here is that he has really made three films in one, and he has failed to flesh out any of the three. (Full Content Listings for Parents also available)</Review>
            <Review>Is Dinesh D'Souza stupid? This seems like kind of faux-innocent question the far-right columnist and polemicist poses all the time. But the answer honestly isn't clear.</Review>

As the couple faces the loss of their dream to have a house and start a family, they discover that the tenant in the apartment below them has been murdered and he left behind a stash of cash-$400,000 worth. Though initially hesitant, Tom and Anna decide that the plan is simple: all they have to do is quietly take the money and use only what's necessary to get them out of debt. But when they start spending the money and can't seem to stop, they find themselves the target of a deadly adversary-the thief who stole it-and that's when very bad things start happening to good people.

            <Review>A fairly standard white-people-in-peril thriller.</Review>
            <Review>Good People provides the degree of entertainment one expects while sitting on a sofa watching a direct-to-video effort rather than the higher standards one sets for paying $10 for a movie ticket.</Review>
            <Review>"Good People" goes from being simply pedestrian to outright preposterous without batting an eye.</Review>
            <Review>It's engaging enough while one is watching it, but not distinctive enough to make it special, or, in this case, enthusiastically recommendable.</Review>
            <Review>James Franco and Kate Hudson are uncharacteristically muted in this watchable but wholly unsurprising London crime caper.</Review>
            <Review>Good People grinds to its predictable, pat conclusion and betrays its generally solid performances and respectable artistic pedigree. Sometimes good people do bad things, sometimes they just make movies that start well and end badly.</Review>
            <Review>This low-rent crime thriller's London setting never feels convincing... and the film's action-packed climax, which sees the couple fending off the bad 'uns using power tools, is even more far-fetched.</Review>
            <Review>Genz piles on lots of tedious and increasingly silly plot turns involving shoot-outs in London and domestic fights involving nail-guns - all en route to a lame, cop-out ending.</Review>

            <Review>The title says it all in this cheap, laborious junior heist thriller from British B-movie journeyman Julian Gilbey.</Review>
            <Review>As mindless entertainment goes, it's a pretty watchable time-passer.</Review>
            <Review>A frothy little heist movie from Britain that starts off with great promise, only to devolve midway into an empty derivative shell of a film.</Review>
            <Review>It's hard to escape the sense that "Plastic" is itself a cheap knockoff, but the point is not to look too closely.</Review>
            <Review>For a film with shootouts, heists, and high-speed chases, Julian Gilbey's Plastic is a strangely lifeless affair.</Review>
            <Review>All champagne and strippers, conspicuous consumption and witless machismo, Plastic is a contemporary British heist movie that already feels dated, as if it were made before the bubble burst on Guy Ritchie's comic book gangster voyeurism.</Review>
            <Review>Plastic isn't an instant classic mainly because of its visual style, sometimes more in touch with an electronic music video than a film. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>A good dose of suspense and action that shows us a different side of the british mafia. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Not just a boring film, but also one that objectifies all its female cast with unnecessary nudity. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>The teen version of Ocean's Eleven if you turn your brain off. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>A wholly derivative, uninspired heist caper that isn't worth your investment.</Review>
            <Review>Highly-stylized piffle designed to titillate and satiate bloodlust while slowly turning your brain to mush!</Review>

            <Review>"People can heal themselves by feeling genuine love for each other," says Mariel's daughter, arms around her mother. It may not be the entire answer, but it's a start.</Review>
            <Review>An artfully arranged account of Hemingway's current life, mixed with footage shot by her late sister Margaux for a 1983 documentary about the family.</Review>
            <Review>There's so much interesting material in the life of the Hemingways, but Running From Crazy doesn't do them enough justice.</Review>
            <Review>It's Margaux, the tragic supermodel and failed actress who took her own life at 42, who emerges as the film's fount of heartbreak in several stunning scenes.</Review>
            <Review>This heart-wrenching and deceptively conventional documentary manages the tensions in its subject and in the vérité approach in a fruitful, illuminating and surprisingly moving way.</Review>
            <Review>A certain Hollywood self-absorption is on display here, but the family's depressing story merits Mariel's vigilant defensiveness.</Review>
            <Review>Kopple is one of my favorite directors because she believes in her audience's intelligence.</Review>
            <Review>A delicate, openhearted work that throws open the shutters on a famously troubled family, making a powerful statement about some of the more forthcoming mental health conversations we as a society should be having.</Review>
            <Review>A sobering documentary focusing on Mariel Hemingway and her struggle with the terrible curse of seven suicides in her family history.</Review>
            <Review>The historical Hemingway Curse stuff is great, the infomercial about how well preserved Mariel Hemingway plays like an Oprah celeb special.</Review>
            <Review>The film is perhaps a little too long, but aside from the saccharine which occasionally lurks beneath this is an otherwise engaging and thoughtful study into a hereditary illness.</Review>
            <Review>Using home movies and other footage, Kopple provides a discomfiting portrait of a family's deep-seated dysfunction.</Review>

            <Review>Wish I Was Here's philosophical scope never gets much bigger than the slip of paper inside a fortune cookie.</Review>
            <Review>It is sometimes maudlin, sometimes trivial and sometimes very moving, but never less than achingly sincere.</Review>
            <Review>The fruits of writer-director Zach Braff's Kickstarter are here for the general public, and they're at once vibrantly weird, beautiful and thoughtful.</Review>
            <Review>Braff plays Aidan with easygoing exasperation and Hudson is better than I've seen her since Almost Famous.</Review>
            <Review>Wish I Was Here is a funny, touching movie that features one of Kate Hudson's best performances and a curmudgeonly good one from Mandy Patinkin.</Review>
            <Review>"Wish I Was Here" is a welcome, if belated, second chapter in a filmmaker's career. I just hope we don't have to wait another 10 years to see what he thinks about life as a forty-something ...</Review>
            <Review>Unfortunately, the film spends so much time trying to define itself, we're never allowed to immerse ourselves into the experience.</Review>
            <Review>Just about all of the "compromises" that Braff says he'd have been forced to make (and I'm slightly perturbed to say this, being a fairly consistent support-the-artist type) would have made 'Wish I Was Here' a better film.</Review>
            <Review>The film creatively runs aground and never jostles itself loose, content to wallow in the kind of misery that "Garden State" rebuffed.</Review>
            <Review>Braff directs a Soggy sitcom of a movie</Review>
            <Review>Braff clearly wants us to find his hapless hero's travails funny and affecting. Instead, they come across as self-indulgent navel-gazing.</Review>
            <Review>Zach Braff's second effort is a tricky one to value.</Review>

            <Review>The trouble with this movie -- aside from its lack of visual wonder and musical shape -- is that you don't trust its priorities.</Review>
            <Review>Another sappy but engaging musical fable from the Irish writer and director John Carney, who made "Once."</Review>
            <Review>The wholesome, hopeful, let's-put-on-a-show enthusiasm may sound hokey but it's actually infectiously joyful. At the same time, Carney roughs up the edges just enough to make this fairy tale seem somewhat accessible and realistic.</Review>
            <Review>This soulful outing is sure to please music lovers. And isn't that everyone?</Review>
            <Review>Begin Again is a not-entirely-successful movie about not selling out; it's a theme that must concern Carney deeply.</Review>
            <Review>Can a meaningful glance mean as much as a kiss? In this film, it can, and that's enough.</Review>
            <Review>For all the doubters out there, take note: Knightley can sing.</Review>
            <Review>It's in parts painfully earnest, never more so than when Ruffalo sees instruments come to life while Knightley plays alone onstage, but it moves along at a nice clip and the recording scenes are shot well.</Review>
            <Review>It hits the sweet spot of love's tortures and love's ability to heal with overly cutesy situations and its fair share of laughs.</Review>
            <Review>Begin Again is the best sort of summer movie, with great performances and a solid core. It's clearly a work that comes from love shared by people who enjoyed making it, and that makes it fun for us to watch out in the audience, too.</Review>
            <Review>The authenticity that was in inherent in "Once" is lost here on a cast of movie stars, and the music isn't quite good enough to elevate a cloying screenplay.</Review>
            <Review>Begin Again is a delight, not only because of its infectious musical vitality but because it follows the unexpected forks in the road.</Review>

            <Review>Beautifully shot, well acted, and the score is lovely, but the film has nothing to say about the human degradation in which it wallows. If you're gonna make me smell dung for two hours, at least fertilize my lawn.</Review>
            <Review>There's no denying Franco's ambition, and in "Child of God" you can see evidence (almost for the first time) that he's reaching for something he may one day attain.</Review>
            <Review>"Child of God" fascinates like a song sung just out of tune but rhythmically sturdy enough to keep you listening in the hopes it'll right itself.</Review>
            <Review>Surprisingly pretty good.</Review>
            <Review>A good faith but blank retelling of McCarthy's first major statement.</Review>
            <Review>This wrong-headed adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's taut 1973 novel, as interpreted by director James Franco, spends too much time trying to create an element of compassion for this devilishly aberrant killer.</Review>
            <Review>Child of God toes the line between success and failure - but, ultimately, leans into success, and occasionally threatens to leap into it entirely.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately the movie's message is that community is sacred, all God's children should be cared for, and the destitute need a human net to save them from descent into madness.</Review>
            <Review>... certainly not for all tastes, but as a raw and visceral portrait of sexual and social defiance, it conveys a powerful glimpse into backwoods desperation and survival instincts.</Review>
            <Review>With Child of God, Franco has come up with something distinctive that both captures the atmosphere of McCarthy's neo-Gothic universe and suggests a consolidation on the director's As I Lay Dying.</Review>
            <Review>James Franco should be hailed for taking a crack at such dense and unforgiving material, but the relentless grimness leaves you numb rather than enlightened.</Review>
            <Review>For obvious reasons too, it's a tough undertaking to endear sociopaths, serial killers and their ilk as something more, something human.</Review>

            <Review>It's one from the heart, and a twisted tale it is.</Review>
            <Review>Such is Kim's plotty momentum that the whole thing feels like an extreme joke made of pained silences, one that somehow strips bare the subtext of overbearing parents.</Review>
            <Review>When it comes down to it, this a movie where the only major female characters are intentionally interchangeable and exist only to castrate men.</Review>
            <Review>Moebius is almost weird enough to be a creation myth, and that's no small accomplishment.</Review>
            <Review>As an exercise in unrelenting discomfort, it's hard to beat this monstrous experiment from Korean provocateur Kim Ki-duk.</Review>
            <Review>An outrageous Oedipal psychodrama that rubs and chafes against Buddhist parable, it also chooses, without a single line of dialogue, to show rather than tell its jaw-droppingly transgressive acts with Chaplin-esque distance.</Review>
            <Review>The clever twists in the story are captivating enough to compensate for the disgusting nature of the acts on-screen.</Review>
            <Review>[Kim Ki-duk] peppers his film's nastiness with baroque humour.</Review>
            <Review>A formalist slice of perversity that never coheres into anything more meaningful than a willful piece of cinematic provocation.</Review>
            <Review>Even by Kim's extreme standards, Moebius maintains such a pitbull hold on its straight-world targets that it enters a shadowy realm of post-subversion.</Review>
            <Review>Moebius marks another feature to come from an innovative director who manages to live up to expectation, and yet at the same time, he never fails to compel and surprise.</Review>

            <Review>Well worth seeing, particularly for Leonard people.</Review>
            <Review>All this is more amusing in theory than practice, partly because Leonard's world of wiseguys and slapstick violence has become so familiar - the caper-movie default mode.</Review>
            <Review>There's a lot of talent up on screen put to no grand use.</Review>
            <Review>No matter what your favourite is of films based on Elmore Leonard books (and I'm for Out of Sight ahead of Jackie Brown), this crime comedy will deliver a surprise.</Review>
            <Review>Schechter's staging is so flat that Leonard's dialogue never pops. You hear the words but not the music.</Review>
            <Review>Perhaps Schechter should have started with a prequel to Death Proof and worked his way up from there.</Review>
            <Review>An abiding insignificance looms over the film, but it's a fun 98 minutes.</Review>
            <Review>Though a decidedly down-market adaptation of the great Elmore Leonard crime novel Switch, Life of Crime is never down-and-out.</Review>
            <Review>It's good, solid Leonard, which, for me at least, is a cosy, comfortable, and extremely fun place to be for ninety-eight minutes.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Alive &amp; Well is a powerful documentary film about the human condition, which follows seven resilient people coming to terms with the profound reality of living with the hereditary chronic illness known as Huntington's Disease (HD). Subjects in the film range from a young woman hoping to start a family , to a mother taking care of her symptomatic 6 year-old son and ailing husband; the drummer of a major country music band, a former NBC News journalist turned HD-advocate, as well as a renowned scientist relentlessly searching for a cure. Far from giving us a hopeless glimpse into life with terminal illness, this film reminds us all of our ability to persevere with strength, despite life's most difficult challenges.</StoryLine>

            <Review>A throwback to 1980s action films, with strong men at the center going up alone against an unambiguously evil foe, "Falcon Rising" is an entertaining film with a thrilling physical performance from Michael Jai White.</Review>
            <Review>"Falcon Rising" is filled with so many action-flick cliches it could serve as a text on how not to do things.</Review>
            <Review>Y. T. Parazi's unmysterious screenplay drops cheesily clever one-liners on the way to a finish that suggests a bid for sequels, though you're more likely to find those on late-night cable than in theaters.</Review>
            <Review>It's a straightforward vengeance tale with no other ambition than to entertain. That said, it has something.</Review>
            <Review>Beyond isolated moments of dickish charm - and his climactic four-way fight involving a sword, a crucifix, and two steel pipes - Chapman just comes across like another pseudo-heroic American behaving badly abroad.</Review>
            <Review>The structural missteps do little to diminish the immense pleasure of seeing [Michael Jai] White in motion.</Review>
            <Review>To the movie's detriment, White doesn't get to show us what he can really do until 30 minutes into the story, then again near the end when he takes on three armed baddies.</Review>

            <Review>A below-ground but slightly above average horror movie ...</Review>
            <Review>Halfway through, the movie loses its grip on logic and truth, and you stop believing it's based on anything other than the years the director spent in his youth, marching in the Greenwich Village Halloween Parade.</Review>
            <Review>Beneath exhausts the appeal of its thinly sketched characters almost as soon as they're trapped together in the mine's emergency bunker ...</Review>
            <Review>As a low-budget disaster thriller, the film works well enough - but it's the commitment the supernatural "question" that makes Beneath worth checking out.</Review>
            <Review>Although the actors and setting seem believable here, 'Beneath' ends up being much too predictable for a horror movie.</Review>
            <Review>f there were double features nowadays, The DescentBeneath be the underwhelming B movie.</Review>
            <Review>The film relies on too many contrivances and generic scare tactics, and there's not enough character depth to establish any emotional connection.</Review>
            <Review>Unable to choose between the horrors of a mine disaster and a ghostly force using the living as puppets. It's disappointing to realize that either direction will yield few thrills.</Review>
            <Review>If Beneath isn't as good a movie as the nerve-shattering The Descent, well, few are. But Beneath aims for the same ambitious mix of physical and psychological terror and does a tidy job of not showing its hand until it's good and ready.</Review>
            <Review>More troublesome than the lack of scares is the absence of even one remotely interesting character.</Review>

            <Review>It's well acted and gorgeously and tenebrously shot.</Review>
            <Review>The film pits their honest passion against the stylized desperation of the actress' religious theater and the decadent hollowness of Berlusconi's political theater.</Review>
            <Review>If "Dormant Beauty" does not rank among Mr. Bellocchio's best movies, it nonetheless still occasionally shows him at his best.</Review>
            <Review>Unlike most movies that rely on TV-news reports to drive the story, Dormant Beauty is complex and humane, and never shrinks to mere spectacle.</Review>
            <Review>Though the movie eschews facile sloganeering, few of its characters or narrative threads are able to develop beyond their function as metaphors.</Review>
            <Review>Swift and often compelling, it's also blessedly unbiased.</Review>
            <Review>An unabashed melodrama, one that obviously wants to have its finger on the pulse of today, yet unafraid of pulling tricks both sincere and comical.</Review>
            <Review>"Dormant Beauty" is well-written, beautifully performed, and nicely made, if a good 15 minutes overlong. But we couldn't help but feel, given how controversial it proved in advance, that it should've been willing to go a little closer to the edge.</Review>
            <Review>Bellocchio may sometimes shut these characters in their rooms, but his view of them all is as open in mind and spirit as a film can be.</Review>
            <Review>Despite the awkward narrative structure, the choppy film serves as a welcome showcase for ably understated performances from veteran Toni Servillo and rising talent Alba Rohrwacher, and a coolly burning Isabelle Huppert.</Review>
            <Review>The result is one huge cinematic morass of gloom, largely unleavened by any redeeming humor -- however black -- or true empathy.</Review>
            <Review>Like Bellocchio's draggy, overrated Vincere, this movie wants us to believe in its depth, while mostly just skimming the surface.</Review>

Initially helpful and clever, IRIS soon begins behaving mysteriously, answering personal questions it shouldn't know the answers to, and sending inappropriate images to her contacts. When it becomes clear she can't simply delete the unwanted evil app, Anna's efforts to confront it will set in motion a fearful series of events that will put her life, and that of her roommate and her fragile brother, in fatal danger.

        <StoryLine>American sideshows were in fairs, circuses and carnivals. There were acts such as glass blowers, musicians, and also the freaks. Most freaks just stood there while the audience wondered past. The Hilton Sisters however were trained to put on an engaging act. They sang, they danced and played a variety of musical instruments. They were "hugely popular." "Bound By Flesh" explores the American sideshow, its origins and its heyday when the Hilton Sisters were on display for huge "streams" of crowds pouring into the tent to get a glimpse of these "fetching" sisters. The film includes interviews with Ward Hall, known as the "King of the Sideshow." He is the last of the sideshow promoters in the style of a P.T. Barnum.(c) Sundance Selects</StoryLine>

        <Duration>145</Duration>
        <StoryLine>March 11, 2011: a serious earthquake and tsunami hit Japan, crippling the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, releasing radiation, and turning the residents of Futaba into "nuclear refugees." The devastation experienced by the town - dead livestock left to rot, crops abandoned, homes and businesses destroyed - was infinitely worse than anything reported by the newspapers. A year later, 500 evacuees are still unable to return to their contaminated homes. The irony of this disaster occurring in a nation that experienced two nuclear bombs is not lost on the victims who poignantly question their responsibility for striking a Faustian bargain with nuclear power. NUCLEAR NATION suggests that a relatively small tragedy could one day be replicated on a much larger scale - perhaps in your own backyard. (c) First Run Features</StoryLine>

            <Review>Few films have opening images more chilling than the ruins of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, or more bleak than the last 10 minutes of "Nuclear Nation."</Review>
            <Review>For the most part, the movie takes an eye-level approach to the disaster, focusing on the experiences of ordinary people living in makeshift shelters and public housing, lining up for food, and returning to their homes in hazmat suits.</Review>
            <Review>[Funahashi's] approach is direct, intimate yet respectful, and sometimes as mournful as the stark piano-and-flute score.</Review>
            <Review>If you were looking for a documentary to blow the lid off the secrecy around the extent of the destruction, and lack of restitution-in other words outrage à la Michael Moore-you will not find it here, but there is much that is worthy and troubling.</Review>
            <Review>This documentary sometimes lingers on vistas better suited to a Godzilla movie, strewn with rubble, devoid of souls.</Review>
            <Review>If nothing else, the film will force you to reassess all the arguments for and against nuclear power.</Review>
            <Review>A minimalist look at the destruction of the city of Futaba in the wake of the meltdown of the Fukushima nuclear plants.</Review>
            <Review>The result is not exactly riveting cinema....it often seems caught between trying to tell a story...and its recognition that the story it has to tell is no story.</Review>
            <Review>Nuclear Nation's anti-nuclear stance is very clear, but it admirably wants viewers to understand its argument instead of shouting it at them.</Review>
            <Review>An assured and sobering documentary that charts the situation in Futaba, Japan, shortly after the 2011 meltdown at the nearby Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.</Review>

            <Review>The movie is DOA from scene one and is never resuscitated.</Review>
            <Review>Life After Beth starts feeling more conventional the wilder and darker it gets.</Review>
            <Review>Once it's safely slotted in the overworked zom-com genre, there's no reason to keep watching.</Review>
            <Review>Baena co-wrote "I Heart Huckabees" and while he has a sense of humor, the jokes here tend to be meager and tend to dribble on.</Review>
            <Review>While Baena tries to offer a reworking of zombie mythology - easy-listening music makes them horny and they have a fascination with attics and smearing dirt on walls - the movie doesn't live up to the promise of its dark start.</Review>
            <Review>Among many missteps is a total tonal identity crisis. Plaza has described Beth as a "zom-com-rom-dram." (N.B. This remark is more clever than anything in the movie it describes.)</Review>
            <Review>Going in expecting one thing and getting another is always going to throw you off.</Review>
            <Review>Life After Beth remains a mildly funny film in search of a director with some bite.</Review>
            <Review>Plaza gives the film its motor, and if Baena's control of the material is occasionally uncertain, 'Life After Beth' plays best when it feeds off her manic, gonzo energy, and runs with it.</Review>
            <Review>Life After Beth is an irritatingly undeveloped project. A charming cast and a few moments of inspired lunacy make it passingly worthwhile for genre fans.</Review>
            <Review>At least it strays from the well-worn romantic comedy formula, but this sketchy tale of suburban teenage obsession struggles to expand its one-joke premise.</Review>
            <Review>Though it stumbles in some cases, "Life After Beth" is a solid zombie romance with some real teeth to it.</Review>

Having no other recourse, Diane and crew risk everything to save Sophie. To remain undetected, they must fly low, at night, through a dangerous Mexican canyon in a client's "borrowed plane".

            <Review>Though it bogs down at times, Yoon Jong-bin's kimchi Western is a rousing, lavishly produced delight.</Review>
            <Review>For all its gloss, "Kundo" fails to resonate. You appreciate the execution, but the film is hindered by its lack of novelty and metaphorical weight.</Review>
            <Review>[A] sweeping, visually elegant picture ...</Review>
            <Review>An often entertaining if overlong look at the last days of Korea's Joseon Dynasty.</Review>
            <Review>Kundo is not the best film of its type, but it's an entertaining amalgam.</Review>
            <Review>The filmmakers stage cast-of-dozens battle scenes and one-on-one showdowns with equal brio.</Review>
            <Review>Precision action sequences sit alongside dazzling period colour, coarse, crazy comedy rides side-saddle with domestic pathos, genre &amp; tone are switched with deft ease, and the pace never lets up. [But] when anything goes, everything seems throwaway.</Review>
            <Review>It's not a classic you'll rave about for days, and at 138 minutes it does go on too long, but for fans of Asian period action, it will certainly serve.</Review>

            <Review>The film's attempt at political commentary amounts to a half-baked treatise on good governance in the face of tyranny and socioeconomic exploitation.</Review>

            <Review>He's a crowd-pleaser reminiscent of Robin Williams, inserting funny sounds and vocal impersonations into nearly every line and alternating raunchy material with moments of unabashed sentimentality.</Review>
            <Review>For the most part, Fluffy's material is just that - fluff, with a touch now and then of bile and bad taste.</Review>
            <Review>"Fluffy" is a standard-issue comedy concert film far better suited to a 90-minute cable TV slot than the big screen.</Review>
            <Review>At one point, the comic says that fans have asked him what he'll have to talk about if he keeps losing weight, to which Iglesias answers that he will always have stories to tell. To its credit, "The Fluffy Movie" leaves you wanting to hear more of them.</Review>
            <Review>Iglesias makes his strongest impact when he sticks to material that is extremely personal.</Review>
            <Review>Iglesias is a likeable presence, and his fluid delivery, complete with spot-on accents and sound effects, is consistently engaging.</Review>
            <Review>Iglesias is a likable guy, but as far as concert experiences go, this one does little to break away from the pack.</Review>
            <Review>The whole film would have seemed staged if Mr. Iglesias hadn't proven he's got the goods by delivering comedic gold.</Review>
            <Review>Inherently funny, with a terrific sense of timing, an amazing gift for mimicry, and an ability to perfectly imitate all kinds of everyday sounds, Iglesias is always charming and frequently laugh-out-loud funny.</Review>
            <Review>Sometimes it takes a long time to get to a particular punchline, but the journey there is always pleasant and honest.</Review>
            <Review>A very big comic -- not as big as he used to be -- tries to get by on very thin material in this lukewarm, but heartfelt comic concert film</Review>
            <Review>Mr. Iglesias's style in his first theatrical concert film is grounded in a down-to-earth warmth and a nimble mimicry that bolsters even routine subject matter.</Review>

            <Review>That rare experience you don't get to have much in the summer anymore, a loud, clanging, original action flick that's grabbing you by the lapels and yelling in your ears.</Review>
            <Review>It's a wicked, violent parable, and one of the only movies of the summer worth talking about after the credits roll.</Review>
            <Review>"Snowpiercer" warms the heart, but doesn't penetrate it.</Review>
            <Review>Fueled by implausibility, and for a good portion of the ride much better for it, Bong-Joon Ho's Snowpiercer posits a nonstop, Earth-encircling train containing the microcosmic survivors of a society killed off by a global warming-induced deep freeze.</Review>
            <Review>Once Mr. Bong sets his monorail in motion the movie assumes an irresistible momentum, accelerated by nonstop mayhem, gallows humor and an immersive visual style that possesses a heady sense of the steam-punk Apocalypse.</Review>
            <Review>This is powerful stuff, and all the more so for its straightforwardness.</Review>
            <Review>Every once in a while I see a movie that leaves me vibrating with energy as I leave the theater, knowing that what I just saw will stick with me probably for the rest of my life... Snowpiercer is one of those.</Review>
            <Review>The film's something of a mess, trading swerve and style for cohesion and coherence. No matter: Nothing else at the multiplex right now is half as entertaining.</Review>
            <Review>Snowpiercer is so didactic it will give intellectually sophisticated viewers a headache.</Review>
            <Review>This is a story of class war, manifest literally and symbolically at the same time. But as he did in The Host, Bong slips his social commentary under the genre playbook.</Review>
            <Review>South Korean filmmaker Joon-ho Bong's latest is a welcome reminder of [sci-fi's] fertile - if often untilled - creative ground.</Review>
            <Review>Bong's latest is his most visceral and action-oriented film to date, tapping into the generous fantasy of its stylized source material.</Review>

            <Review>In short, it's a PG plot for an X-rated story.</Review>
            <Review>A tired premise and a sheen of desperate flop sweat tanks this DOA comedy, which plays more like an ancient Playboy doodle than a full-fledged movie.</Review>
            <Review>Even for a farce, the situations stretch credulity far beyond the breaking point.</Review>
            <Review>It's strange to watch a comedy full of talented people that does not work from the opening scene. It's like eating food and not tasting anything.</Review>
            <Review>Sex Tape is warmer and more amusing than its ads would lead one to believe. In fact, it's almost good enough, leaning a little too hard on the innate likability of stars Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel.</Review>
            <Review>At heart, it's about as naughty as an old Disney movie with Dean Jones, Suzanne Pleshette, and an unruly Great Dane. I liked its gung-ho slapstick spirit, though. No one's slacking off.</Review>
            <Review>Segel and Diaz have a great rapport, and though nothing innovative or rip-roaring happens in the extended comic setpieces, the whole enterprise is enjoyable enough, pure Not As Bad As It Looks.</Review>
            <Review>Sex Tape is surprisingly tame, perhaps too tame.</Review>
            <Review>Sex Tape is stymied from the get-go by its couch-potato approach to comedy writing and its apparent fondness for smut-fuelled, gender-stereotypical relationship flaps that would make even dating teenagers roll their eyes.</Review>
            <Review>Segel and Diaz have some work ahead of them to erase this one from the pop culture DVR.</Review>
            <Review>This is a far-fetched, preposterous letdown.</Review>
            <Review>If I didn't chuckle once or twice, I'd be filing a complaint against Sony with the Better Business Bureau for marketing Sex Tape as a comedy.</Review>

        <Title>The Search For Simon</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>96</Duration>
        <StoryLine>David is 39 and for almost thirty years, he has been looking for evidence of alien activity, as at the age of 10 his younger brother Simon (aged 7ish) suddenly disappeared, and has never been seen since. David's father told him that "Simon was abducted by aliens." Completely devastated by the loss of his younger brother, and best friend, David vowed to find his brother - or at the very least find out about the Aliens that took him. This quest has taken over and completely filled David's life. It's more than a passion, it's an obsession. David has been meeting people - filming interviews and generally obsessing over alien abductions ever since. David's best (and only) friend Robert, saddened by his friend's obsession and unwillingness to let go of the past, tries his best to get David interested in other things: games, pub quizzes, re-enactment societies and even... women. And then one day after a chance random encounter with a book writing psychologist with an ear for obsession, he catches the eye of a pretty young woman, and everything changes... Although this film appears to be about Alien Abduction etc - it is actually really about obsession, addiction, loss and most importantly Love, which ultimately is what we are all searching for...
