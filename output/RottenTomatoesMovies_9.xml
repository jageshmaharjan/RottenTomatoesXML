        <Title>Call of the Wild</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 1935</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>89</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Featuring Clark Gable and Loretta Young, this loose adaptation of Jack London's classic story is one of the livelier versions of the oft-filmed tale and was shot on location on rugged, snowy Mt. Baker, Washington where cast and crew had to endure harsh winter conditions including blizzards, sub-zero temperatures and difficulty in obtaining supplies during filming. In this version, the role of Buck the dog is diminished and the main focus shifts to the romance between prospector Jack Thornton, and Claire, a young bride who is abandoned in a cabin by her gold-fevered husband. The story begins in Skagway, Alaska where impoverished prospector Thornton loses his mine in a poker game. He then buys Buck, a big dog deemed too vicious for sled pulling. Thorton feels a bond with this dog and with love and patience, earns his trust and retrains him. Buck's cruel former owner Reginald Owen is enraged by this because he wants Buck back so he can kill the dog for mangling his hand. To get him back, he bets Thornton that Buck cannot pull a half ton for one hundred yards. The devoted dog does it and the newly enriched Thorton, his pal Shorty, and Buck set out to find a claim. They run across the half-dead abandoned woman, continue on to an empty cabin belonging to her husband, and then take over his mine, finding lots of gold. Later Shorty heads back for badly needed supplies while Thornton, Buck and the girl remain behind. Romance blossoms at the cabin. Meanwhile, crooks overtake the woman's creepy husband and force him to reveal his mine. He does and they try to kill him. Then they attack the couple and steal the gold. After more excitement, the crooks leave and find final justice during their escape. Later Buck appears and helps to save the fallen husband by leading Thornton to him. After he recovers, his bride decides to return to him and Thornton and Buck are left to await the return of Shorty.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Jack London's The Call of the Wild has been a difficult book to adapt to film, but this William Wellman-directed entry is still the best. It's probably one of the more interesting films from the first half of the '30s.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>Too dumb for the arthouse, but too smart for the mall multiplex, the movie satisfies, paradoxically, precisely because it doesn't deliver on expectations.</Review>
            <Review>Levine has fun with the genre, but he's found more interesting movies to make since. "Mandy" isn't quite dandy, but it's a cut above average.</Review>
            <Review>"Mandy" is a sturdy little slasher film, nothing more.</Review>
            <Review>While some of the kills are sufficiently clever and gnarly, "Mandy Lane" is never particularly frightening. And the twist at the end raises the wee issue of character motivation-or lack thereof.</Review>
            <Review>There's a slightly nasty twist to some of the violence, with an air of school shooter menace ultimately creeping in as the group's tormentor is revealed.</Review>
            <Review>A slightly artsy attempt to revive the teen slasher movie, "All the Boys Love Mandy Lane" drifts awkwardly between popcorn entertainment and angsty mood piece.</Review>
            <Review>...a less-than-auspicious debut for a filmmaker who has gone onto bigger and better things (ie there was nowhere but up for Levine, really).</Review>
            <Review>What we might actually call a "thinking man's slasher flick."</Review>
            <Review>The film's ambitions are respectable, but it unfortunately doesn't live up to them.</Review>
            <Review>This isn't a masterpiece, just a well made effort by someone who seemingly understands the pros and cons of how to deliver the shivers.</Review>
            <Review>The third act twist is what's made this one's inflated reputation, but it's what makes this more risible than a mere genre entry.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is well-made, with more effort placed on building tension than on creating bloody payoffs.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Featuring the viral humor of its creators Ed Skudder and Zack Keller, Dick Figures the Movie is a classic story of friendship, love and betrayal. Its heroes Red and Blue (on the solemn advice of a Japanese raccoon) embark on an epic quest to discover The Great Sword of Destiny - and hopefully unlock the secret to the most-awesomest gift of all time for Blue's super hot girlfriend, Pink. And like the series, the 73-minute movie is set to an all original thumping electronic dance score from Composer Nick Keller. (C) Media Grind</StoryLine>

            <Review>Getting [Wolverine] to the movie's above-average finale required three writers - Christopher McQuarrie, Mark Bomback, and Scott Frank - to pad the plot.</Review>
            <Review>It restores the tarnished lustre to this most fan-beloved of Marvel characters by doing precisely what Chris Claremont and Frank Miller's near-sacred 1982 run did: It pumps some feeling into the guy along with his muscles and steel talons.</Review>
            <Review>Director James Mangold's film features some breathtakingly suspenseful action sequences, exquisite production and costume design and colorful characters, some of whom register more powerfully than others.</Review>
            <Review>Too quickly the random fights pile up -- so many yakuza thugs who forgot to wear chain mail that morning -- and you yearn for the film that might have been.</Review>

            <Review>This biopic is part hagiography, part expose, and gravely incoherent.</Review>
            <Review>In the end, hers is a journey as complicated and fascinating as that of South Africa itself.</Review>
            <Review>It would have benefited the film if Roodt had been as bold with the mechanics of his storytelling as he is with his inclusion of the title character's less savory moments. But its strengths, particularly the two lead performances, far outweigh its flaws.</Review>
            <Review>"Winnie Mandela'' really stumbles when it comes to depicting the couple's painful separation, which the film suggests resulted more from politics than Winnie's infidelity.</Review>
            <Review>Despite the marquee names and their obvious talent, the film feels like a made-for-TV movie.</Review>
            <Review>Distant and obvious, it takes a story with many angles and reduces its edges, becoming a glorified TV movie.</Review>
            <Review>This saccharine hagiography desires to establish Nelson Mandela's controversial ex-wife as great. It succeeds, somewhat, but boringly, which leaves the truth not served well.</Review>
            <Review>The end credits song's beautifully delivered, full-throttle emotional bombast only serves as a dismaying reminder of how much the film otherwise lacks any similar passion and soul.</Review>
            <Review>The audacity and determination of its subject doesn't find its way into this shallow and superficial biopic.</Review>
            <Review>Though Winnie Mandela is a more-than-serviceable classroom recounting of events, it fails to reach much higher than that, and deals with identity issues when deciding whether to challenge your views or simply glorify real-life events.</Review>
            <Review>Sometimes it can be strangely said that it's a miracle when a certain film even exists, warts and all. So let's cut to the chase, and what really matters in this immensely important movie. Not the least which is, 'Strike a woman, and you strike a rock.'</Review>
            <Review>A warts-and-all biopic which focuses on its subject's childhood, college days and marriage while making short shrift of her transition into a war criminal.</Review>

            <Review>In the complexly stoic Martelli and masterfully craggy, haunted Hauer, an alluringly opaque pas de deux of loss and uncertainty is wonderfully realized.</Review>
            <Review>Ms. Scherson's style - backed wholeheartedly by the cool cinematography of Ricardo de Angelis - may value mood over information, but it's the perfect vehicle for a portrait of two damaged souls grasping for a security they no longer possess.</Review>
            <Review>a curiously effective coming-of-age tale</Review>
            <Review>Il Futuro, aptly bereft of actual Italians, teases out the idea of thrown-off foreigners, bridged by fluid identities.</Review>
            <Review>Alicia Scherson's enthralling Il Futuro asks the question no one wants to hear: How would you see the world after a personal tragedy?</Review>
            <Review>Even though mood trumps character psychology, the entire cast provides mesmerizing, evocative performances.</Review>
            <Review>There are some interesting plot points and decent performances, particularly from Martelli, but the ending doesn't really bring Scherson's ideas together in an impactful way.</Review>
            <Review>One can choose to indulge in the sci-fi flights of fancy seeding Alicia Scherson's Il Futuro (The Future), or become engrossed in its mercurial, hypnotic theme of sexual discovery.</Review>
            <Review>Il Futuro is a playful, soulful movie, affecting because it's populated by lost children who can somehow sense they're in a movie.</Review>
            <Review>However, it has a really unique point of view that puts it on par with some of the most adventurous South American cinema of recent years.</Review>
            <Review>A counterproductively "literary" film with no satisfying payoffs, Rutger Hauer's blind recluse notwithstanding.</Review>
            <Review>Hauer, absolutely superb, exudes sadness and longing as a hulking, damaged man grasping at the past.</Review>

Every member of the van End family is preoccupied with his or her own peculiar fixation--be it father Evert's Skype relationship with a boy in Africa (seemingly his only functional relationship), or mother Etty's relentless tirades against her dope-dealing youngest son or praises for her eldest son about to marry. Trapped in the middle is the youngest--15 year-old Eva--struggling for any attention or affection at all. When Veit, the Adonis German exchange student Eva invited, moves in, the family is shocked and each family member must confront his or her own doubts, insecurities, fears and desires. During Veit's two week stay, all five family members begin to reinvent themselves, led by former wallflower Eva, who begins a dramatic transformation.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Few New York City photos are as familiar or evocative as the one that inspired the documentary "Men At Lunch."</Review>
            <Review>But just as the documentary doesn't really have the goods when it comes to solving the photograph's mysteries, it only skims across the surface of what the picture represents.</Review>

            <Review>While some interviewees proffer genuine insights worth pondering, these can't balance the film's wayward focus and runaway aggrandisement.</Review>
            <Review>The core image is striking, but it's not quite as "iconic" as claimed. The allusions to 9/11 are unnecessary. But Men at Lunch remains an honourable, worthwhile effort.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2012</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>115</Duration>
        <StoryLine>In a time of internal political disturbance, Roman police inspector Gian Maria Volont� (the bad guy in A Fistful of Dollars and For A Few Dollars More) gets that plum assignment: crack down on political dissidents; then proceeds to slash the throat of married mistress Florinda Bolkan ("a beautiful, kinky masochist" - Vincent Canby). But as homicide cops swarm over the murder scene, guess who gets tapped to head the investigation? And, as every clue unearthed - most perversely planted by Volont� himself - leads right back to... is anybody going to do anything about it? As director Elio Petri's split-second edits rocket back and forth between flashback and detection, to the insidious rhythms of Ennio Morricone's score, Investigation becomes a biting critique of Italian police methods and authoritarian repression, a psychological study of a budding crypto-fascist (but is the arrogantly grim-faced Volont� building a case against himself to be punished, or to prove his invincibility?), a probing why-dunnit, and a buildup to a question-stamped finale.-- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

        <ReleaseDate> 1953</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>68</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Legendary director Stanley Kubrick made his feature debut with this allegorical drama about war. Four soldiers whose plane has crashed discover they're behind enemy lines in an unnamed country. Desperate to escape, they decide to build a raft and travel up the nearby river into allied country. However, their presence is discovered by a local woman who stumbles across them in the woods, and they learn that an enemy general is nearby, determined to flush them out. Stanley Kubrick served as producer, director, screenwriter, editor, and cinematographer on Fear and Desire, which he made on a budget of only $40,000. One of the soldiers was played by Paul Mazursky, who later went on to a distinguished directorial career of his own. Kubrick displayed little enthusiasm for his debut feature later in his career, and is said to have attempted to prevent it from being screened on several occasions. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <ReleaseDate> 2011</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>89</Duration>
        <StoryLine>The play Romeo and Juliet has been translated around the world. Now this gritty, funny new feature film retells William Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet" in Yiddish. A middle-aged ER nurse, Ava, in graduate school-and bitterly lapsed observant Jew-undertakes a Yiddish translation of Shakespeare's great classic, Romeo and Juliet. Meanwhile, her houseguest, also a Hasidic dropout, is "leaking" Kabbalistic magic, and enchants her studio apartment. In what might be the first Yiddish "mumblecore" film, Annenberg creates a parallel universe (aka Williamsburg, Brooklyn), where Romeo and Juliet stem from divergent streams of ultra-orthodox Judaism and speak their lines in street-smart Yiddish. -- (C) Vilna City Films</StoryLine>

            <Review>Oy, such terrible jokes and choppy direction.</Review>
            <Review>The film, written and directed by Eve Annenberg (who also stars) is sprawling and sometimes confusing, but its premise is charming and not at all far-fetched.</Review>
            <Review>There have been many untraditional film adaptations of Shakespeare's, but few have been as unorthodox as this one...</Review>
            <Review>Annenberg's attitudinous Shakespeare riff is a unique blend of psychodrama, ethnographic experimentation, and high-concept hustle.</Review>
            <Review>It's wonderful what they've done with a few gauze curtains, some candles, a bunch of funny subtitles and a lot of inventiveness.</Review>
            <Review>[B]lows away Shakespearean fairy dust on fusty nostalgic notions of classic Yiddish theater, with exuberance of lo-fi Luhrmann in a West Side Story set in exotic Brooklyn.</Review>
            <Review>The writer-director has bitten off a bit more than she can chew but this is a must-see for anybody who loves the sound of Yiddish, as well as those interested in Jewish culture in general. The young actors, renegades from the Satmar, are superb.</Review>
            <Review>Nearly all of the characters seem curiously representative of some seldom-seen sub-cultural trend, if they're ultimately somewhat interchangeable.</Review>
            <Review>The story has running some real comic possibilities, but few make it to the finish line</Review>
            <Review>If Shakespeare were alive today and in good health, as I'd wish him to be in, he'd probably be begging for a circumcision to honor this little film that gets the gist of his most famous tragedy down pretty well.</Review>

How is she so qualified? Because she's has never been depressed herself. Really! She even says that any autobiographical reference she makes to having been depressed is totally fictional. After all, what Chinese American family isn't perfect? Certainly not the Wongs! Irreverent, clever, and insanely meta-theatrical, Wong's attempts at playing savior unravel faster than the nest of yarn she's perched on. She descends quickly into the divide between Asian porn stars and the impossibly perfect. Along the way she becomes a hysterical living commentary on the cultural and societal pressures that may be creating depression in the first place.</StoryLine>

            <Review>"Big Star: Nothing Can Hurt Me" is no doubt going to please fans of the cult rock band, but the rest of us may feel like outsiders - not put off by the proceedings, really, but somewhat mystified as to what all the fuss is about.</Review>
            <Review>[Documents] the band's coming together and falling apart and [offers] a passionate tribute to its brilliant, beautiful music.</Review>
            <Review>[A] thoroughly detailed (though a bit long) doc that charts the band's thwarted expectations.</Review>
            <Review>Don't think of "Big Star: Nothing Can Hurt Me" as a sad tale. Cautionary, maybe. Mostly it's a celebration of a great band making great music, if only for a short time.</Review>
            <Review>The downside of their cult stature is a shortfall of footage, but the music is uncannily gorgeous, well deployed and copious: for non-initiates, it'll be like finding lost treasure.</Review>
            <Review>There's a distinct lack of archive footage of the band in their prime, but the director makes a good stab at bringing to life the studio sessions that produced such treasures as The Ballad of El Goodo.</Review>
            <Review>The result is an observed story, without the why of Big Star's musical disintegration that is at the heart of their enduring legend.</Review>
            <Review>Rewards true fans while enticing the uninitiated.</Review>
            <Review>Two emotions fight for dominance while watching the saga - the exhilaration that comes from seeing great artists working at the peak of their powers, and the frustration of watching the world ignore those great artists.</Review>
            <Review>Messy but inspiring musical doc.</Review>

            <Review>Ultimately, it's popcorn nihilism without the big laughs that helped distract from the casual approach to life and death in 'Red'.</Review>
            <Review>This is a likable, almost gentle comedy and also a violent action film about the possibility of a nuclear bomb going off in a major city.</Review>
            <Review>Willis is self-evidently capable of kicking the asses of men considerably younger than himself. But at some point shouldn't he consider an alternative pastime?</Review>
            <Review>No movie with this much ass-kicking should feel so lifeless.</Review>
            <Review>Ridiculously action-packed and just as endearing, Red 2 is why we go to sequels despite our well-earned cynicism about studios churning them out.</Review>
            <Review>It's nice to see oldsters cavorting in kaboom movies, but a little of this stuff goes a long way.</Review>
            <Review>Red 2 is chock full of red herrings with none more glaring than the one tricking us into thinking the screenwriters' return would retain the tone and feel of the first.</Review>
            <Review>"Red 2" is at least as good as its predecessor, if not noticeably better.</Review>
            <Review>It's not that surprising coming from a Bruce Willis flick, but its thesis of gun lovers being morally superior to bomb lovers is still entirely suspect.</Review>
            <Review>A highly-watchable but stilted sequel that serves as a complacent sequel to the fun original.</Review>
            <Review>Much of the originality has faded and Morgan Freeman's absence is keenly felt, but the end result is still a fun, exciting adventure.</Review>
            <Review>'Red 2' goes beyond the confines of an origin tale, becoming a meaty middle act so the players can relax into the story better.</Review>

            <Review>It's a film whose plea to the audience resembles Jobs' appeal to the crowd in that iPod-unveiling scene: "Believe this is important and exciting," it asks, "because I say so."</Review>
            <Review>The irony is that a man who treasured innovation and sleek, stylish design should be the subject of a film that's so bland and bloated.</Review>
            <Review>Other than people who are mildly curious about the guy who put the smartphone in their pocket and the tablet computer in their knapsack, I'm not sure who "Jobs" was made for.</Review>
            <Review>Jobs is the equivalent of a feature-length slow clap.</Review>
            <Review>A missed opportunity.</Review>
            <Review>Like the man it's about, "Jobs" is thin and unassuming, but keeps surprising you with ideas and innovation.</Review>
            <Review>While entertaining, the film doesn't achieve the ultimate goal of Steve Jobs' work: to make the things that matter beautiful and to find beauty in the small moments.</Review>
            <Review>The opening scene of Jobs, the feeble biopic of the iconic Apple founder, is the one that keeps recurring throughout the film, with varying degrees of hagiographical worship, which is never less than lofty.</Review>
            <Review>It's just insightful enough, albeit briefly, to be worth your time.</Review>
            <Review>The critics screwed up on this. It is a much better film than its rating here. Take that from someone who worked in IT for 44 years and who knows the difference between "fresh" and "rotten".</Review>
            <Review>The movie is littered with small details of lore that should make Apple fanatics happy.</Review>
            <Review>A noble but unworthy effort that will likely disappoint viewers looking for a thoughtful look into the technological genius.</Review>

            <Review>Despite being a rather thin, by-the-books documentary that abruptly changes course at the halfway mark, Red Obsession tells a fascinating financial tale about the rise of "wine fever" in China.</Review>
            <Review>"Red Obsession" gains interest as it delineates how the production and sale of first-growth Bordeaux has become the biggest of businesses and how the Chinese may or may not fit into the picture.</Review>
            <Review>A film about obsession, about wine-mania, about people who live, breathe, eat, think, drink wine.</Review>
            <Review>The movie raises legitimate concerns about the cultural and economic implications of status-minded overconsumption.</Review>
            <Review>[a] probing, fascinating documentary</Review>
            <Review>A concise portrait of not only the historic Bordeaux region of France, but also of the way its business has been impacted-for good and ill-by China's emergence as a superpower.</Review>
            <Review>A lot of worthless talk about the greatness of Bordeaux takes too much away from the very few fascinating parts of the story.</Review>
            <Review>Wine documentary examines China's consumption's contribution to runaway prices.</Review>
            <Review>Some nice cinematography and pleasant talking heads help Red Obsession go down smooth, but this is more like a pamphlet than an actual movie.</Review>
            <Review>Sly, sometimes funny documentary version of Bottle Shock, with China playing the role of 1970s Napa as it creeps up to smack the snooty Old World wine snobs.</Review>
            <Review>This exceptional, visually and informationally rich doc reveals much beyond its ostensible theme.</Review>
            <Review>Red Obsession is informative, and entertainingly so, with its honeyed Russell Crowe narration and sweet tracking shots through sun-dappled vineyards.</Review>

        <StoryLine>The anonymous author of a popular advice column is pursued by a mob hit-man whose face she picked at random for her byline sketch. While she isn't searching for a book deal, aspiring novelist Sally (Lara Jean Chorosteki) earns her pay by penning the "Mr. Know-it-All" in a local newspaper. When a celebrity endorsement plunges Sally into the national spotlight, however, her agent requests a headshot to accompany the column. Sally responds by submitting a sketch of Albert (Jefferson Brown), a random stranger she spotted at the movies. What Sally has failed to realize, however, is that Albert is a notorious contract killer working for a powerful mob boss (Al Sapienza). When Albert's identity is compromised, he vows to kill Mr. Know-it-All. Meanwhile, Sally attempts to gather more information on the man whose visage she borrowed through a series of clandestine interviews that lead to a heated romance. Later, when Albert's boss is dumped by his girlfriend over advice doled out by Mr. Know-it-All, the kingpin puts out a contract on the columnist. Later, when Albert discovers Sally's secret identity, the conflicted killer is faced with a difficult decision. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>This latter-day B movie can be rather fun in its preposterousness and bargain-basement style.</Review>
            <Review>Getaway is pretty much a 90-minute car chase. That's it.</Review>
            <Review>The only participant to emerge with its reputation intact--though not its paint job--is the Shelby Mustang muscle car, which also delivers the film's most nuanced and psychologically complex performance.</Review>
            <Review>Getaway has some of the crass trappings of a charmingly crass, go-for-broke action pic like the delightful Crank. But it's too dumb - and far too cynical about what audiences want - to even know how to have fun with them.</Review>

        <StoryLine>In this non-traditional documentary about Paris, instead of covering the usual sights and sounds of the city, writer/director Chris Marker takes his film crew to the street and interviews people on the spot and in their homes. Comments range from the French-Algerian conflict and the stock market to everyday problems of housing, homelessness, working conditions and moral and religious observations. Although the classic art and culture that made Paris famous worldwide is discussed, the primary focus is on how Parisians look at themselves and their everyday lives. ~ Dan Pavlides, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>At nearly three hours, "Le Joli Mai" meanders, but it remains potent when it gets personal, even if the political aspects can seem a little dated.</Review>
            <Review>Penetrates to the Parisian soul.</Review>

        <Title>Undressing Israel: Gay Men In The Promised Land</Title>
        <ReleaseDate/>
        <Duration>46</Duration>
        <StoryLine>When many people think of Israel, it is often in terms of modern war or ancient religion. But there is much more to the Jewish state then missiles and prayers. In his debut as a documentary filmmaker, adult-film entrepreneur and political columnist Michael Lucas examines a side of Israel that is too often overlooked: its thriving gay community. Undressing Israel features interviews with a diverse range of local men, including a gay member of Israel's parliament, a trainer who served openly in the army, a young Arab-Israeli journalist, and a pair of dads raising their kids. Lucas also visits Tel Aviv's vibrant nightlife scene-and a same-sex wedding-in this guided tour to a country that emerged as a pioneer for gay integration and equality.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Ellis throws in lots of references to social media in a desperate bid for cultural currency, while Schrader intersperses the drama with pretentious shots of boarded-up movie theaters to suggest this is all a metaphor for the death of cinema.</Review>
            <Review>"The Canyons" is one of those movies that makes you feel worse just for having watched it.</Review>
            <Review>If the creation of self-important tedium were a competitive sport, "The Canyons" would take home the gold.</Review>
            <Review>An inept, misanthropic melodrama written by novelist Bret Easton Ellis and funded mostly through a Kickstarter campaign.</Review>
            <Review>A tale of young, vapid, sexually insatiable Z-listers in Hollywood had the credentials to be deliciously awful fun but almost every time something tawdry (and potentially interesting) is about to happen, the film pulls its punches and leaves the action.</Review>
            <Review>The Canyons rapidly evolves into a film hopelessly at odds with itself.</Review>
            <Review>Bret Easton Ellis's screenplay is filled with the worst kind of tin-eared dialogue and situations that seldom rise above their soapish base instincts, and in the third act, he clearly just gives up and turns one of his characters into Patrick Bateman.</Review>
            <Review>Very little animating emotion to explain why the film had to be made, why the story needed to be told.</Review>
            <Review>With the pungent combination of a script from novelist Bret Easton Ellis, a performance by Lindsay Lohan and direction by Paul Schrader, The Canyons might have been a micro-budget sensation, but sadly it reeks of laziness.</Review>
            <Review>Schrader's idea of a modern-day noir has promise but Ellis' script lets him down and leaves the actors adrift with no scenes to play.</Review>
            <Review>Merely confirms Schrader as an all-but spent force (it's been largely downhill since the dismal Dominion) and nails Bret Easton Ellis as a one-trick pony.</Review>

        <Duration>85</Duration>
        <StoryLine>American Meat is a solutions-&amp;#8208;oriented documentary chronicling the current state of the U.S. meat industry. Featuring Joel Salatin, Chuck Wirtz, Fred Kirschenmann, Steve Ells, Paul Willis, and farmers across America, it takes an even-&amp;#8208;handed look at animal husbandry. First explaining how America arrived at our current industrial system, the story shifts to the present day, showing the feedlots and confinement houses, not through hidden cameras but through the eyes of the farmers who live and work there. From there, the documentary introduces the revolution taking root in animal husbandry, led by the charismatic and passionate Joel Salatin. Stories are shared of farmers across the country who have changed their life to start grass-&amp;#8208;based farms, and everyday solutions highlight actions people can make to support America's agriculture.

            <Review>A low-key, fairly evenhanded look at industrial vs. organic methods of raising livestock.</Review>
            <Review>Less sensationalist than its similarly themed predecessors, this informative documentary makes a strong case for the benefits of organic famring.</Review>
            <Review>An advocacy film better suited for a class than for a cinema.</Review>
            <Review>The problem is that this rah-rah chronicle never addresses the dangerous, distressing disparity between non-organic farms, which are still the norm, and the ones focused on here.</Review>
            <Review>American Meat won't fully counter the negative sentiment that the meat industry has, but it's not entirely propaganda, either.</Review>
            <Review>Too simplistic. You can't help but recall a much more insightful and thorough doc that treads similar ground, Food, Inc.</Review>
            <Review>Very informative documentary even if it allows the filthy Steve Ells of Chipotle's a platform.</Review>
            <Review>A hopeful and enlightening documentary on the baby steps being taken to offer alternatives to big industry farming.</Review>
            <Review>Despite the intensity of its scope and research, American Meat is a decidedly soft-hitting display of an overweening good faith that, frankly, just can't jibe with the times.</Review>

            <Review>As in their previous comedies, Pegg and Frost play men who refuse to stop acting like boys. But these pint-swilling Peter Pans also know how to work the heart and the brain for belly laughs.</Review>
            <Review>If Wright doesn't quite sustain this astonishing mixture of sadness and silliness all the way through, he gets major points just for attempting it in the first place.</Review>
            <Review>The gonzo side of the plot is not quite as engaging as the human drama, and the scenes in which the characters meet up and try to mesh again are some of the best in the film.</Review>
            <Review>Wright &amp; Pegg continue making the sort of films that the 12-year-old versions of themselves probably always dreamed of being a part of; that sense of joy and practically disbelief that they actually get to do this for a living is right up there on-screen.</Review>
            <Review>The film's strength is its comedic bent - there are some very funny moments contained herein.</Review>
            <Review>Robert Frost famously mused 'Some say the world will end in fire/Some say in ice.' I prefer Edgar Wright's vision: It will end in a pub.</Review>
            <Review>The World's End is pretty blasted funny and a fine finale to director/cowriter Edgar Wright and star/cowriter Simon Pegg's so-called 'Cornetto Trilogy.'</Review>
            <Review>It is a more mature piece of work, which seems a peculiar way to label a zippy comedy about drinking beer and outrunning the apocalypse.</Review>
            <Review>[The World's End] soon turns from this not-quite-nostalgic focus to one more like Pegg and Edgar Wright's first two Cornetto movies, which is to say, a melding of well-known genres in order to spoof them.</Review>
            <Review>The World's End is not only the season's funniest movie but also its best action thriller, its best addiction drama, and its best movie about the apocalypse.</Review>
            <Review>The World's End marks the third part of Pegg and Wright's self-described "Cornetto trilogy." It's an appropriate moniker. With this final film they've slowed down a bit, grown up a lot. And saved the richest bite until last.</Review>
            <Review>If you're looking to laugh your butt quite literally off of your body and leave with some food for thought, then The World's End may just be the tastiest flavor of the Cornetto Trilogy yet.</Review>

        <Duration>82</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Three astronauts experience unexpected adventure en route to a distant planet in this independent sci-fi comedy. A robotic space probe is sent by French scientists to the planet Mars, but the machine goes haywire after someone sneezes on it and it loses its way en route to the Red Planet. A second robot is sent on the same mission, but the machine takes it upon itself to rescue its mechanical sibling, and just before crashing into the Martian surface the robot sends back an image suggesting there's life on the planet. The United States quickly puts together a manned mission to Mars, with the heroic but inept Charlie Brownsville (Mark Duplass) joined by his more capable colleagues Dr. Casey Cook (Zoe Simpson) and Hank Morrison (Paul Gordon). As the crew struggles to beat their European rivals to Mars, Charlie tries to find a way to live up to his image and Casey and Hank discover that love can thrive outside Earth's atmosphere. Director Geoff Marslett shot Mars using digital equipment, and then used a new computer-assisted rotoscoping technique to give the images a special cartoon-influenced visual style; the film also includes a supporting performance from author, musician, and political gadfly Kinky Friedman as the President of the United States.</StoryLine>

        <Duration>88</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Violet (Alexis Bledel) and Daisy (Saoirse Ronan) are a pair of gum-chomping, gun-toting teenage assassins who casually snuff out crime figures in New York City, bothered only by the fact that a concert by their favorite pop idol Barbie Sunday has suddenly been canceled. Determined to raise cash for some Barbie Sunday dresses, the duo takes on a new hit, only to discover a kind of reckoning in the form of sad-sack shut-in (James Gandolfini) who is dying alone in his apartment of terminal cancer. He persuades the duo to kill him out of mercy, prompting an odyssey of self-examination that catapults the junior enforcers into a world beyond Barbie Sunday and bullets for pay. From Geoffrey Fletcher, the Academy Award-winning screenwriter of PRECIOUS comes a mesmerizing hybrid of New York City crime fable and existential coming-of-age drama in which teenage kicks match wits with adult-world turmoil, placing three wounded souls into a line of fire none expected - themselves.-- (C) Cinedigm</StoryLine>

            <Review>A thriller that might as well have been released in 1996, when everybody and their brother and their sister and their cousin twice-removed was trying to be Quentin Tarantino ...</Review>
            <Review>Of course, the violence is cringe-worthy and, at times, over the top. But view this as a modern comic book/fairy tale, and it's easier to accept this saga of girls with guns and the life lessons they eventually confront.</Review>
            <Review>The film's subtle visual allure is all but stamped out by the impression that the director tries too hard to be an idiosyncratic auteur in the vein of Quentin Tarantino.</Review>
            <Review>Violet and Daisy are just violent and crazy - which is, ultimately, the real problem. And why we should care about them remains the one mystery no one here can quite unravel.</Review>
            <Review>A rather dull affair.</Review>
            <Review>We don't feel the weight and menace of death, nor the volatile emotions of youth, and have nothing to respond to beyond the spectacle of girls with guns.</Review>
            <Review>This self-consciously quirky comedy-thriller... swings unevenly between passages of soul searching and bouts of cartoony violence in the Tarantino mould.</Review>
            <Review>Though it can't keep up that kind of energy throughout, especially as it's set mostly in one room, it's charming enough -- and short enough -- that there are no hard feelings.</Review>
            <Review>Alexis Bledel and Saoirse Ronan are way too good for material as obnoxious as this.</Review>
            <Review>A lot of acting talent is squandered in Violet &amp; Daisy, a sort of postmodern coming-of-age story about two teenage girls who kill people for a living, then play patty-cake as they plan their next hit.</Review>
            <Review>Subverting audience expectations of an over the top "teenage girl killer" movie with a character study could have been great, but the character study in question feels paper thin.</Review>

            <Review>Cliché is not a bad thing if it's done right. Like a good jazz improvisation, "2 Guns" leads to the same place but not the way you may expect.</Review>
            <Review>Beyond ridiculous but always entertaining. Washington and Wahlberg are terrific.</Review>
            <Review>Pair their back and forth with a hilarious cast of periphery players and 2 Guns pretty much has everything you'd want from a summer action comedy.</Review>
            <Review>If 'Lethal Weapon' and 'Midnight Run' were billiard balls, Kormákur's directing is the cue ball hitting those two and smacking '2 Guns' straight in the corner pocket. Classic.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Planes has enough bright colors, goofy voices, and slick animation to distract some young viewers for 92 minutes -- and probably sell plenty of toys in the bargain -- but on nearly every other level, it's a Disney disappointment.</StoryLine>

            <Review>An endearing enough David-and-Goliath tale, aimed squarely at younger kids.</Review>
            <Review>A visually colorful but otherwise vanilla continuation of the series.</Review>
            <Review>The plot is generic to a fault.</Review>
            <Review>Strictly by the numbers, from the believe-in-yourself moral to the purely predictable ending.</Review>
            <Review>Has the look and feel of Pixar's 2006 hit, "Cars," if not the latter's charm or strong story.</Review>
            <Review>"Planes" is for the most part content to imitate rather than innovate, presumably hoping to reap a respectable fraction of the box office numbers of "Cars" and "Cars 2," which together made hundreds of millions of dollars.</Review>
            <Review>Disney should cut its losses and release the rest of the trilogy as originally intended.</Review>
            <Review>Big showbiz trusts heartland America's love affair with all manner of vehicular machinery so much that it shamelessly copied 'Cars' and labeled it 'Planes.'</Review>
            <Review>...rarely manages to achieve the heights achieved even by 2006's entertaining yet lackluster Cars...</Review>
            <Review>It's a shame that Disney and Pixar aren't in the 'classic-making' business anymore; just the 'distraction-making' business.</Review>
            <Review>A direct-to-video-quality spin-off that only exists to sell toys.</Review>
            <Review>While kids might respond to the fast-paced airborne antics, the humor isn't clever enough or the story surprising enough to satisfy accompanying grown-ups.</Review>

            <Review>Not since the schmaltzy Bucket List has there been a more blatant example of checklist comedy than the ultra-raunchy The To Do List.</Review>
            <Review>It's good-natured and raucous, with many scenes that are just sketched but a few that are truly funny.</Review>
            <Review>Many of The To Do List's jokes have this first-draft, is-that-all-there-is? quality.</Review>
            <Review>The To Do List settles for surface and cartoony rather than deep and heartfelt.</Review>
            <Review>By proudly wearing its "otherness" (a word I use ironically) on its sleeve, The To Do List feels fresh and strange and wondrously new. It shouldn't, but it does.</Review>
            <Review>"The To Do List" doesn't reinvent the wheel; we all know the "summer that changed everything" trope. But it's startling when you realize how rare it is to see a girl chasing sexual experience so doggedly - and with such a lighthearted tone.</Review>
            <Review>Above all, The To Do List announces the arrival of Aubrey Plaza, movie star, with a role that takes full advantage of the awkward persona she's now best-known for.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately, "The To Do List" settles for being intermittently amusing, never living up to the promise of its talented cast.</Review>
            <Review>Despite the sometimes childish sight gags, what salvages the movie is a refreshingly adult attitude toward the messy matter of sexuality.</Review>
            <Review>This raunchy teen comedy more than earns its R-rating ... but it does so with a lot of heart.</Review>
            <Review>One more overly crude teen comedy</Review>
            <Review>The film gives these people just about nothing funny to do, and it's full of both gross-out gags that don't connect and dialogue that isn't especially funny.</Review>

            <Review>There's nothing wrong with Paranoia that a stronger director, livelier leading actors and several hundred fewer narrative conveniences wouldn't cure.</Review>
            <Review>This is a film at odds with itself, wanting to be a 99 percenter rallying cry but wallowing in and fetishizing 1 percenter accoutrement at every turn.</Review>
            <Review>Paranoia, a ho-hum thriller about corporate spying in the high-tech world, comes off as a lot more preposterous than paranoid, and it takes no more than a few frames for the eye rolling to commence.</Review>
            <Review>Corporate thrillers just aren't what they used to be.</Review>
            <Review>In a movie about a new generation's hunger to topple the old guard, pretty boy Hemsworth is outclassed by his veteran costars, who get more mileage from baring their teeth than he does baring his chest.</Review>
            <Review>The movie doesn't make a whole lot of sense and, when it does, it would be better off not doing so.</Review>
            <Review>If there's nothing hideously embarrassing about Paranoia, there's nothing really right either.</Review>
            <Review>Director Robert Luketic [does] nothing beyond his contractual obligations (which presumably read, "Um, make a movie, I guess").</Review>
            <Review>Paranoia is professional in every way, but there's no pulse to it. It is entirely adequate, livened up only by a few supporting turns.</Review>
            <Review>It's a premise that stands or falls on the tense fate of a charismatic lead and dialogue that does not clang right off the screen; a woeful lack of both ensures Paranoia more than falls -- it collapses.</Review>
            <Review>It's rather a slight affair.</Review>
            <Review>It's slickly directed by Robert Luketic even though it's all pretty unbelievable. But in fact I rather enjoyed it.</Review>

        <Title>Th�r�se</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>110</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Fran�ois Mauriac's legendary 1927 novel of French provincial life has been gloriously brought to the screen by the inestimable Claude Miller in his final film. Sumptuously photographed to capture the full beauty of the pine-forested Landes area in southwest France, TH�R�SE DESQUEYROUX is a beautifully conceived drama of exquisite taste. Marvelously played by the luminous Audrey Tautou, Th�r�se is a heroine hewn from the same stock as Madame Bovary or Anna Karenina, suffocated by her provincial marriage. Th�r�se has married less for love than for convenience, but it is not long before the casual disinterestedness shown her by her arrogant husband, Bernard (Gilles Lellouche), sets her mind in motion. Life is easy at first, as Bernard's pinewood estates keep them both in the lap of luxury. But when Th�r�se's best friend Anne (Ana�s Demoustier), who also happens to be Bernard's younger sister, falls madly in love with a handsome young Portuguese man, Th�r�se begins to see what she has been missing in her life. Corralled by Bernard's family into persuading Anne to forego her planned nuptials, she begins to see first-hand the awesome power of passionate love, as Anne will go to any length to keep her lover by her side. Soon, Th�r�se begins her own fight against the oppressive Desqueyroux family.(c) MPI Media</StoryLine>

            <Review>A remarkably pretty, if equally dour, portrait of the bored, oppressive life led by the provincial bourgeoisie.</Review>
            <Review>Exquisitely tasteful but suffocatingly dull ...</Review>
            <Review>While there's a certain staid feeling to the production, it does deliver a solid working-over to the era's gentry.</Review>
            <Review>The film looks great. As for the human element, the mood is more apathetic than tragic, and star Audrey Tautou has to take much of the blame for the film's failure.</Review>
            <Review>The magnificent nature that surrounds Therese becomes her prison. It's an interesting paradox, but not necessarily an especially satisfying experience.</Review>
            <Review>It only looks like Tautou does a lot with a little in her performance because much of her character's inner life is implied through pensive scenes of her frowning and deferring her gaze.</Review>
            <Review>But while the final shot shows the possibility of hope, what comes before is too depressingly dour to turn so sharply into that.</Review>
            <Review>'Thérèse' is as emotionally distant as its heroine</Review>
            <Review>[Miller's] best-known works, including "The Little Thief" and "Alias Betty," centered on complex female protagonists, and "Thérèse" is a fitting final addition to his filmography.</Review>
            <Review>Exactly the kind of film the French New Wave was rebelling against.</Review>
            <Review>Although this remake of the 1962 classic is beautifully shot and acted, it's so hollow and bleak that it leaves us cold.</Review>

            <Review>Part drug comedy, part psychological drama, the movie is slight, but only superficially so.</Review>
            <Review>Crystal Fairy is all about that uneasy destination: never in sight but always on the edge of perception.</Review>
            <Review>Low-key, naturalistic and original, Sebastian Silva's study of two Americans finding their way in Chile is an often funny, always compelling journey that rings true.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>Hannah Arendt is ultimately a pleasure, because Sukowa plays the most forbidding of intellectuals as a fabulous, passionate doll.</Review>
            <Review>Barbara Sukowa delivers a beautifully modulated performance, showing the rigor of Arendt's thought and convictions while revealing the contours of a passionate woman with complex relationships.</Review>
            <Review>[Barbara Sukowa] invests Arendt with a steely fury, but the film, set during and after the 1961 trial of ex--Nazi official Adolf Eichmann, has an entertaining cocktail-banter superficiality.</Review>
            <Review>Von Trotta's direction is assured and the film has an incredibly strong performance at its core, and it asks a number of important questions, even though it doesn't dare to answer them.</Review>
            <Review>Like A Hidden Method, David Cronenberg's drama about Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, Hannah Arendt takes seriously the life of the mind.</Review>
            <Review>In an era of sleepwalking surrender, "Hannah Arendt" is a welcome wake-up call, a ringing reminder that warring forces first assemble on the battlefield of conscience.</Review>
            <Review>Although the movie etches a rather thin portrait of Arendt, it succeeds in humanizing her as a person, contextualizing her as a theorist, and evoking the courage she showed in airing convictions that often went against the scholarly tenor of her time.</Review>
            <Review>...actors in supporting roles telegraph the controversies surrounding Arendt's personality as if they were attempting to literally touch the viewer's nose.</Review>
            <Review>Von Trotta doesn't do justice to this strong woman and her contribution to thinking about the nature of evil.</Review>
            <Review>A crisply measured character study with plenty of intriguing ideas, elevated by a terrific, finely calibrated performance by Sukowa.</Review>
            <Review>A dramatically solid, if talky, account of the controversial episode in the post-war world that spawned the phrase "the banality of evil", with strong performances from Barbara Sukowa and Janet McTeer.</Review>
            <Review>I really like this film. I like the milieu that's created of this intellectual life in New York during the 1950s. I think Sukowa is fantastic in the role.</Review>

            <Review>It might actually be funnier if you haven't seen the first film, but I'm not in a position to say--only that it's disappointingly similar to the original, and suffers from the comparison.</Review>
            <Review>After 2009's inane comedy Nativity, no one was clamouring for a sequel, but at least this one tips the scales into sublime silliness.</Review>

        <Title>In Search of Blind Joe Death: The Saga of John Fahey</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>58</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Known as the father of American primitive guitar, many consider John Fahey to be a foundational figure in American music. As both musician and musicologist, Fahey made a fundamental contribution to our understanding and appreciation of such music genres as Delta blues, Appalachian bluegrass, New Orleans jazz and even industrial and electronica, influencing everyone from Glenn Jones to Sonic Youth. IN SEARCH OF BLIND JOE DEATH combines interviews, performances and archival footage with animation in a kinetic, musically charged tribute to a tremendously influential composer, guitarist, author and provocateur. Interviewees include Pete Townshend, Joey Burns of Calexico, Chris Funk of The Decemberists and renowned radio personality Dr. Demento, aka Barry Hansen. (c) First Run Features</StoryLine>

        <Duration>85</Duration>
        <StoryLine>In a thriller reminiscent of the best of Alfred Hitchcock, Madeline Zima and Agnes Bruckner star as best friends who share everything until one of them reveals a twisted sense of loyalty. Sara is an ambitious, beautiful twenty-something working her way through law school. Her hard work and stellar academic record has paid off with a coveted scholarship. Her kind spirit and generous manner attracts one of the popular guys at school, Eric. His jealous girlfriend, Brooke, who comes from a wealthy, privileged background, decides angrily to publicly humiliate Sara at the bar where Sara works. Watching from the bar is Alex, gorgeous and even more privileged even than Brooke. Alex takes Sara under her wing to comfort her. As a way of getting back at Brooke, Alex encourages Sara to continue her flirtation with Eric. For a little while, it's great fun. But it backfires - Brooke's father is the head of the scholarship board, and Brooke convinces him to revoke Sara's scholarship. Then Brooke gets Sara fired from her job. Devastated, Sara turns to Alex. As the two girls become closer, a sexual tension develops between them. As they discuss what to do about Brooke, Alex tells Sara about her own stepmother, a woman she despises. Alex casually suggests to Sara that they should make a murder pact. Alex would kill Brooke for Sara, and Sara would repay by killing Alex's stepmother. All their problems would be solved. Sara shrugs off the suggestion as a joke. The next day, Brooke is found dead, and Alex appears at Sara's door, reminding her of the pact. Sara realizes she has been used and that Alex has set her up to take the rap for Brooke's murder. Out of her elements and emotionally distraught over the betrayal, Sara knows that if she wants to survive, she is going to have to fight back with an equally cunning and deadly plan of her own.

        <Duration>96</Duration>
        <StoryLine>DREW: THE MAN BEHIND THE POSTER is a feature-length documentary film highlighting the career of poster artist Drew Struzan, whose most popular works include the Indiana Jones, Back to the Future and Star Wars movie posters. Telling the tale through exclusive interviews with George Lucas, Harrison Ford, Michael J. Fox, Frank Darabont, Guillermo del Toro, Steven Spielberg and many other filmmakers, artists and critics, the journey spans Drew's early career in commercial and album cover art through his recent retirement as one of the most recognizable and influential movie poster artists of all time. Three filmmakers have united to bring this film to life; Greg Boas (Hefty Inc.), Charles Ricciardi (Torino Pictures), and Erik P. Sharkey (Sharkey Productions), assembling one of the most intriguing film lineups and crafting a comprehensive presentation about the artist, the art, the stories behind Drew's most recognizable creations, as well as a never-before-seen insider's examination of the industry and the profession of motion picture advertising.

            <Review>Though it will play well with genre diehards on video, the sometimes awkwardly shot doc is too fawning and narrow in scope to attract much of a crowd in theaters.</Review>
            <Review>At length, the cheerleading (capped with fawning fanboys at San Diego Comic-Con) becomes a mildly taxing torrent. And Mr. Struzan, while an agreeable presence, is not an especially engrossing speaker.</Review>
            <Review>The summary comes when the low-key Struzan offhandedly reveals what he often hears: "Give it your magic." It's all on view here.</Review>
            <Review>Drew makes a valid case for the artist as not simply an all-time great, but as a casualty of a business that prizes bottom-line cost management above unique creativity.</Review>
            <Review>The demure, self-effacing Struzan undermines Sharkey's strategy by insisting his art is only the product of a mundane creative process.</Review>
            <Review>the documentary is also a sly elegy for a changing Hollywood where real hands-on artistry is being replaced by the rush to digital homogeneity.</Review>
            <Review>A movie that celebrates the work, but at the expense of contemporary John Alvin, who isn't just a glaring omission from the story, but in a couple of instances is actively obliterated from it.</Review>
            <Review>This star-studded documentary about poster artist Drew Struzan would never play as fiction: His rags-to-riches journey from poverty to Hollywood acclaim is straight out a '30s movie.</Review>
            <Review>There's a context to Struzan -- not just biographically, but culturally -- and while Sharkey seems to understand that, his movie, ironically, doesn't illustrate it particularly well.</Review>

            <Review>Anyone interested in movement politics in the 21st century will get plenty to ponder in this well-made doumentary.</Review>
            <Review>If his methods don't come off smoothly, Mr. Meltzer's conclusion does leave you feeling that even the whole story would be cold comfort for those involved.</Review>

            <Review>More of a frustrating experience than an enlightening one.</Review>
            <Review>It suffers from a slow start, but blossoms into a rather fascinating piece of nonfiction psychological portraiture.</Review>
            <Review>Jamie Meltzer's outstanding documentary Informant is either a study of one man's evolving political views, or of a man whose psychological issues have granted him the gift of self-justification.</Review>
            <Review>It creates a useful distance between Brandon Darby and his stories that allow for us to assess them individually, reinforcing the film's suggestion that the truth is elusive.</Review>
            <Review>Fairly involving doc about a de-radicalized revolutionary turncoat.</Review>
            <Review>While Meltzer's documentary is an interesting character study, this misguided informant is never quite as compelling as you'd hope.</Review>

His mother struck by a car while shopping for Christmas presents, 15-year-old Eddie (Joseph Phillips) is devastated to learn that her chances of survival are slim. His optimism is rekindled, however, when his mother comes to him in a dream and reveals that she will make a full recovery if he can find her a real halo. But when Eddie proposes the fantastical endeavor to his brother Stewart (Angus Harrison), the more practical-minded sibling dismisses it as a fool's quest. The last person Eddie ever expected to believe his incredible story is his grouchy teacher Mr. Lambert (Timothy Spall), but with no one else to turn to in his hour of need, the desperate teen throws caution to the wind and decides to ask him anyway. Meanwhile, with Christmas approaching and his mother fading fast, Eddie races to find a real-life angel and receives some help from a most unlikely ally.</StoryLine>

            <Review>You might think you can see where Almost Christmas is heading but it never quite loses its acerbic edge or goes emotionally blooey.</Review>
            <Review>This engaging if somewhat underwhelming tale of unlikely redemption builds a funny-sad web of intersecting interactions around its strong central perfs.</Review>
            <Review>The film is happy to observe wryly as boredom and failure threaten to overwhelm the men.</Review>
            <Review>The film has an accomplished mood of cantankerous despair, but it's still little more than downbeat fluff.</Review>
            <Review>I wish I could give four stars to Giamatti's big, sad eyes and outrageous Civil War beard.</Review>
            <Review>Worth enduring only for a rare lead performance by Paul Giamatti, whose expert delineation of rage and frustration lends form to Morrison's otherwise shapeless script.</Review>
            <Review>"All Is Bright" is reminiscent of those utterly forgettable Canadian movies bankrolled on the government dime in the name of cultural preservation.</Review>
            <Review>Phil Morrison's direction and choices aren't as bold or as inventive as his styles in Junebug. The story doesn't lend itself to those traits that made him a quiet sensation in the mid-2000s.</Review>
            <Review>An amoral dark comedy set during the Christmas season.</Review>
            <Review>Morrison films this redemptive story - which has some hard-to-swallow moments - with a dusty gray palette that suits its characters and masquerades the story's more obvious sentimentality.</Review>
            <Review>"All is Bright is nothing more than empty threats and bottomless desires haphazardly thrown together around a more interesting event that you never get to see.</Review>
            <Review>Overall, it's truly as exciting as you'd think watching two people sell Christmas trees would be, even if those two people are Paul Giamatti and Paul Rudd.</Review>

            <Review>It persuades us early on that its aura of political tension and suspicion, its taciturnity, its very strictness of silent observation as it begins, are fostering an intelligent thriller.</Review>
            <Review>Though the film runs a mere 105 minutes, it weighs on viewers like an eternity.</Review>
            <Review>The movie examines the possibility of maintaining one's humanity in a truly oppressive society.</Review>
            <Review>Hoss, wearing her blond hair pulled back tight, and wearing an expression of inscrutable melancholy, gives a performance that doesn't feel like a performance at all.</Review>
            <Review>The occasional ravings of the patients, ringing off the walls in Petzold's measured quiet, provide an appropriate backdrop to the heroine's need for freedom, yet the movie's politics never trump its humanity.</Review>
            <Review>This is well-trod ground for Petzold, but never has it been so fully realized, so palpable, as in "Barbara."</Review>
            <Review>...where there's a rough, stormy beauty to this seaside village, it's also something of a prison without walls, which is not lost on this inmate.</Review>
            <Review>Hoss is such a star, one of the finest actresses in the world. Her work with Petzold is exceptional, but I find myself wondering what Fassbinder would have done with her.</Review>
            <Review>A quietly tense drama ... builds slowly to its conclusion, as subtly powerful as it is inevitable.</Review>
            <Review>Barbara offers us historically motivated immorality offset by some heartfelt sensitivity, a side order of depression, and finishes off with some ennobling hope. It's definitely one of the best foreign films of the year.</Review>
            <Review>This is a remarkably subtle movie, spending most of its energy zeroing in on the clenched face of its heroine, looking for cracks.</Review>

Rocks = Grenades. Trees = Control towers. Sticks = Submachine guns. The youthful innocence of the game gradually takes on a different tone as the quest for victory pushes the boundaries of friendship. The would-be warriors get a searing glimpse of humanity's dark side as their combat scenario takes them beyond the rules of the game and into an adventure where fantasy combat clashes with the real world.

            <Review>Co-directors Jason Lapeyre and Robert Wilson do little more than repeatedly echo the pic's theme after establishing the basic conceit of Lapeyre's script in the opening minutes.</Review>
            <Review>I Declare War plays like a C-student's final exam essay on Lord of the Flies. Any interest in the game is overridden by the massive amounts of allegory lifted straight from Golding's novel.</Review>

            <Review>The performances may be slightly uneven across the cast of a dozen distinct personalities (plus a dog), but overall the effect works because, after all, they're just playacting ... right?</Review>
            <Review>Imagination is what these filmmakers could use more of, as their ingenious concept doesn't develop much beyond gimmick.</Review>
            <Review>I Declare War proves potent from the simple fact these minors portray soldiers without censor.</Review>
            <Review>A bitter but paradoxically entertaining fantasia.</Review>

        <Duration>105</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Writer-director Diablo Cody (Academy Award (R) winner for Best Screenplay, Juno, 2007) delivers this hilarious tale of innocence lost and paradise found, starring Julianne Hough (Safe Haven), Octavia Spencer (Academy Award(TM) winner for Best Supporting Actress, The Help, 2011) and Russell Brand, Get Him to the Greek). After a nearly fatal accident, 21-year-old Lamb Mannerheim (Hough) is beginning to realize that the world is much bigger than her small, God-fearing Montana town. Armed with a big, fat insurance payout and a checklist of untried sins, there's only one place for her first taste of temptation...Las Vegas! Now this wide-eyed, innocent girl will have to navigate the bright lights, seedy bars and dark alleys of "Sin City." And, with the help of a few new friends (Brand and Spencer), Lamb just might survive her strange adventure and discover what it means to really live. Holly Hunter (Academy Award winner(TM), Best Actress, The Piano, 1993) and Nick Offerman (TV's "Parks and Recreation") also star in this oddball odyssey of lost souls, broken faith and cheap cocktails...a true journey of the heart.

            <Review>The movie goes nowhere, and Ms. Cody's screenplay is relentlessly talky while standing still.</Review>
            <Review>Cody's satiric knocks on Christians couldn't be more blundering and obvious. Yet her dialogue is often funny, and the unusual three-way friendship is refreshing.</Review>
            <Review>The script needed another draft. And the screenwriter needed another star - and a real director.</Review>
            <Review>Cody has concocted a modern-day "Alice Through the Looking Glass," with none of the danger or wit.</Review>
            <Review>The problems with "Paradise," Diablo Cody's first directing effort and fourth produced screenplay, begin almost immediately ...</Review>
            <Review>Cody is an intermittently wonderful screenwriter but the fully realized characters and silver-needle wit of "Juno" and "Young Adult" are nowhere to be found in her debut as writer/director.</Review>
            <Review>Add Paradise to the list of Juno copycats as it takes Cody's own clichéd, heightened reality and unabashedly tries way too hard in doing so.</Review>
            <Review>Paradise is far from a bad start, but it's not the introduction Cody was probably capable of making.</Review>
            <Review>...a middling (yet watchable) vibe...</Review>
            <Review>"Paradise" is a very bland and forgettable film, which is not something you expect from Diablo Cody even on her bad days.</Review>
            <Review>An eminently compelling slice-of-life made all the more enjoyable by Julianne Hough's irresistible turn as the sympathetic, multi-shaded Lamb.</Review>
            <Review>To me, a film about Las Vegas should never be boring. And that's what disappoints me most about 'Paradise.'</Review>

            <Review>A troubling exposé of Sea World's hazardous entertainment trade.</Review>
            <Review>Blackfish makes an especially strong case for the innate marvel of these animals: that they are smart, social, communicative and loving.</Review>
            <Review>In the wild, orcas live between 50 and a hundred years. In captivity, it's half that. It's simply a strong argument to free all the Willies.</Review>
            <Review>"Blackfish" is a disturbing movie, one that will make you rethink parks like SeaWorld and their value.</Review>
            <Review>Blackfish is intended to rattle and provoke in the hopes of bringing about change.</Review>
            <Review>"Blackfish" is grim. But then again, so is the plight of these magnificent, intelligent whales.</Review>
            <Review>The product of Gabriela's research-alongside co-writer Eli B. Despres-is the riveting documentary Blackfish.</Review>
            <Review>Must be seen by audiences, and should be mandatory for wildlife lovers and advocates, so we can prevent another corrupt organization like Seaworld from ever rising to prominence again.</Review>
            <Review>Really great documentaries are like zeitgeist napalm; and Blackfish carries the torch.</Review>
            <Review>For all it's artistic shortcomings, though, I really hope that this movie is able to instigate some kind of change in the way we treat orcas, or at least how we think about them.</Review>
            <Review>Powerful, heartbreaking, disturbing doc about captive orcas.</Review>
            <Review>Perhaps the documentary form does have the potential to effect sweeping social change. Only time will tell.</Review>

            <Review>One of the most intriguing and thoughtful American films of the year.</Review>
            <Review>Its absurdist tact won't be for everybody, but there is satisfaction in the nuanced, often-pleasing performances from Rudd and Hirsch as they slowly reveal their characters to both the audience and each other. These two grow on you.</Review>
            <Review>It's an intimate two-hander with lots of dialogue, humour and poignant revelations, set against a backdrop of rugged woodland beauty.</Review>
            <Review>[A] gently existentialist buddy movie.</Review>
            <Review>The performances and ghostly, melancholic atmosphere make it satisfying twist on the male buddy film.</Review>
            <Review>David Gordon Green somehow brings together the poetic sensibility of his independent art movies and the humorous lowbrow non sequiturs of his studio comedies; the results are one of a kind and often weirdly moving.</Review>
            <Review>With beautiful and interesting cinematography Prince Avalanche manages to put you out in the middle of nowhere with Alvin and Lance and their dysfunctional relationship.</Review>
            <Review>There's some terrific stuff going on here, its minimalist bent and gorgeous photography combining to form a quietly immense dramedy that should age very well.</Review>
            <Review>For those who've come for the juvenile humor, the film has very little to offer. Unfortunately, there is nothing particularly moving or substantive, either.</Review>
            <Review>Most of the film feels directionless... Yet, I can't deny that Prince Avalanche has a charm about it</Review>
            <Review>Prince Avalanche certainly takes its time getting anywhere, but it's hard to complain too much when the company's good and the scenery is this nice.</Review>
            <Review>An offbeat story with an unfocused director and narrative, Prince Avalanche becomes a mere lucid dream of cinematic enjoyment.</Review>

            <Review>"Dealin' With Idiots," a sort of "Waiting for Guffman" for Little League, isn't a great movie, but it's a heck of a lot better than its title.</Review>
            <Review>[A] flat, aimless comedy skewering the parents of junior baseball players.</Review>
            <Review>Garlin's ultra-restrained approach suggests that attempting hilarity is sometimes a veiled defense mechanism.</Review>
            <Review>The movie was largely improvised, which lends itself more to scenes than a feature-length film.</Review>
            <Review>There are a few inspired moments, but Garlin goes for easy laughs, and the actors' broad improvisations often fall flat.</Review>
            <Review>This isn't actually a movie about kiddie sports - it's a movie about Garlin interviewing the other parents and players to see if there's an interesting movie to be made at all. Answer: There isn't.</Review>
            <Review>Garlin's second feature is consistently sweet, funny and smart. Keep it up.</Review>
            <Review>To fully appreciate Dealin' with Idiots, the viewer must have some working knowledge of its writer/director/star Jeff Garlin. Or perhaps patience is a more accurate description.</Review>
            <Review>Much of Dealin' with Idiots feels improvised, which is okay when the actors are fully on their game. But here, perhaps the heat of the day and location or insufficiently precise direction have resulted in an awful lot of dead screen time.</Review>
            <Review>The film is reduced to a series of unfunny mockery laid out so Garlin can display his trademark deadpan reaction.</Review>
            <Review>Dealin' With Idiots is at its strongest when it forgets about plot ... altogether (which is most of the time) and gives itself over to the laid-back pleasure of improvisation among veteran professionals finding and exploring a good groove together.</Review>
            <Review>There's not much point in making a film about how different and dumb people are without giving the judgmental, one-man Greek chorus his own legitimate comeuppance.</Review>

            <Review>Screenwriters Ziad Doueiri and Joelle Touma pull quite a few punches here, making the doctor improbably naive about Israeli-Palestinian tensions so that his transformation seems profound.</Review>
            <Review>"The Attack" doesn't force us to pick a side. But it does force us to question our outsiders' hope in conciliation.</Review>
            <Review>Arouses profound questions about fanaticism, cultural identity, and the essential mystery of other people, even those we think we know best.</Review>
            <Review>It's set up as a descent into the heart of darkness, but it ends up playing out in pallid shades of grey.</Review>
            <Review>Imagine a blissful life taken away: Story of an Arab man who's assimilated into Israeli society but finds out that his wife was a suicide bomber. Nothing new here about the conflict, fair portrayal of the sides, thought provoking without solutions.</Review>
            <Review>[Doueiri] does a fine job of presenting us with two worlds in conflict: modern, prosperous and progressive Tel Aviv, and Nablus, a city of shadows, squalor and paranoia.</Review>
            <Review>I couldn't help but feel as though Doueiri's movie, however adept and mature, is something of a setup, an all-purpose guilt machine.</Review>
            <Review>A sort of mystery in reverse, 'The Attack' is both a character study and a love story. It's also about terrorism and the driving forces behind catastrophic acts.</Review>
            <Review>The film often seems poised to lean towards didacticism, but Douieri consistently foregoes heavy-handed political statements and stays focused on Amin's personal journey</Review>
            <Review>We learn that beneath some urbane and sophisticated Israelis lies a cold and hardened heart. We see Palestinians who live to commit terror without regard to its consequences.</Review>
            <Review>Intimacy, memory and questioned identity all bleed into one dejected protagonist who can't quite do the heavy lifting that the screenplay calls for.</Review>
            <Review>It's a sorrowful film, as Amin finds some answers he doesn't want to hear, and discovers that other answers are simply unknowable.</Review>

            <Review>One of the happiest sights you'll see all summer is a montage of Gerwig running and twirling across Chinatown with David Bowie's "Modern Love" on the soundtrack.</Review>
            <Review>As Frances literally dances her way through the streets of New York, you can't help smiling and knowing she will be OK. She will figure out how to be the adult she was meant to be.</Review>
            <Review>Few films top Woody Allen's Manhattan for capturing New York City's blend of rapture and apprehension. Noah Baumbach's Frances Ha comes close.</Review>
            <Review>Writing with Gerwig, Baumbach has created a fey, sneakily charming generational touchstone on a par with Annie Hall and his own Gen Y col-grad comedy Kicking and Screaming.</Review>
            <Review>In your twenties you decide on the final version of you. Sophie is working on it; Frances is stuck in her crazy, clueless, can't-pay-the-rent stage.</Review>
            <Review>It's a tribute to Gerwig's performance, somehow both clumsy and elegant, that she wins us over despite ourselves, that we come to appreciate her aimlessness in a goal-oriented society ...</Review>
            <Review>The camera loves her. Probably because the director does, too.</Review>
            <Review>Gerwig draws upon her well of previously-demonstrated charisma, her ample capacity for twerpitude refined, honed, elevated.</Review>
            <Review>Sweet without being saccharine and wrenching without being devastating. Frances Ha is a film of many small surprises, but they contain big, satisfying rewards.</Review>
            <Review>(Gerwig's) willingness to hold absolutely nothing back deserves mad respect and can't help but make a viewer feel guilty for finding it all quite exasperating.</Review>
            <Review>Game and not a self-promoting booster, always slightly outside the loop, the title character accepts what is dealt without complaint or anger.</Review>
            <Review>The thoughtfulness and commitment of Gerwig's performance in its shifts from chaotic exuberance to rigorous rehearsal suggest that she is the more interesting artist to watch.</Review>

            <Review>Doin' It In The Park thrives simply via its myriad sights of nobodies juking and dunking their way past opponents, exuding an authentic for-love-of-the-game competitiveness that's as infectious as it is intense.</Review>
            <Review>"Doin' It" bounces like a crossover dribble, gliding swiftly and surely through interviews, videos and history lessons, then transitioning to today's dedicated ballers and playground culture.</Review>
            <Review>Whether or not you play yourself, Doin' It in the Park is as involving as an afternoon on the court, and just about as much fun.</Review>
            <Review>An irresistibly entertaining, uplifting, well-edited tribute to the subculture of pick-up basketball in NYC.</Review>
            <Review>Documentary about New York street basketball offers great technical quality and admirably insider interviews, but celebrates the subject unquestioningly, without a larger context.</Review>

            <Review>Seriously, if not always elegantly, the film portrays the great Ip Man as someone trying to survive, which is to say just as often a victim as a victor.</Review>
            <Review>Soap opera, set-bound and unexceptionally written and directed.</Review>
            <Review>The naturalism of Wong's performance is undercut ... by Yau's use of phony-looking sets, sterile CGI and flashy aerial shots.</Review>
            <Review>The overall sense is of a rushed, simplistic installment in a well-worn biography franchise.</Review>
            <Review>The Final Fight plays out like a collection of greatest-hits vignettes barely connected to one another.</Review>
            <Review>It's admirable that Ip Man: The Final Fight takes a different approach to the character than the other Ip Man films out there, but it lacks the excitement that made Ip Man and Ip Man 2 so entertaining.</Review>
            <Review>More a frequently elegant drama than an outright action movie.</Review>
            <Review>Ip Man was a notable martial arts instructor, he was not a saint. Perhaps someday, somebody will make an accurate film about the man. Meanwhile, we have these kung fu pseudo-biopics to entertain us.</Review>
            <Review>Cut off from his home and family in China, martial-arts teacher Ip Man tries to adapt to life in Hong Kong. Intriguing if reverential account of an icon's final years.</Review>
            <Review>The action choreography eschews the slow-motion, wire-assisted grace of Yuen Woo Ping's in "The Grandmaster," but does a solid job of crisply and clearly showcasing a few epic brawls.</Review>
            <Review>The soul of this movie is really in its tireless references to the historical and social conditions of 1950s and 60s Hong Kong, whose street views are recreated in vibrant, saturated colours.</Review>

            <Review>Christliness has always been an element of the Superman myth. But this film's near literal insistence upon it becomes absurd since director Zack Snyder and screenwriter David S. Goyer don't dramatize the analogy, they presume it.</Review>
            <Review>No fun costume change in a phone booth, no wowing humans with his powers and no repartee with reporter Lois Lane.</Review>
            <Review>The movie consists of endless declamation, endless violence.</Review>
            <Review>There's very little humor or joy in this Superman story.</Review>
            <Review>There's plenty to like in Snyder's hectic, rowdy film. But by the time we reach the bludgeoning excesses of the last half-hour it's hard to shake the sense that this was an opportunity at least partially missed.</Review>
            <Review>Cavill broods handsomely as Superman, but this reboot skimps on fun and romance.</Review>
            <Review>Man of Steel is the movie of the summer. It's the Superman movie we deserve. And it's about time.</Review>
            <Review>Snyder is an adrenaline junkie forever jonesing for a fix; he does less building to the action beats than backing each one into the next.</Review>
            <Review>A curiously empty exercise in blockbuster filmmaking, Man Of Steel is full of sound and fury signifying... you know what.</Review>
            <Review>I'm excited to see where Man of Steel goes, now that it's accomplished its own bit of world building. There's every reason to expect the inevitable sequels will be better.</Review>
            <Review>What's missing in Snyder's Superman is a dash of the hokey goodness that Christopher Reeve contributed to the role and the comic cold cheesiness that Gene Hackman and Terrence Stamp brought as Luthor and Zod.</Review>
            <Review>Man of Steel is a very good superhero movie, but it's not necessarily a fun superhero movie.</Review>

            <Review>There's nothing new here, just old stuff in a new-ish package. This movie's enjoyable, but never as daring or bizarre as it could have been.</Review>

            <Review>Turbo is much stronger than Disney's Planes, and while parents may wonder if it's the right message to send youngsters that no dream is too big for the dreamer, Turbo is still a solid pick for family movie night.</Review>
            <Review>Boasts one of the most one-note protagonist in animated film history, some troubling racial elements, and a paint-by-numbers execution that makes this film about the dream to go fast feel painfully slow.</Review>

        <Duration>80</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Sybil Temtchine (Ten Benny, Passion of Ayn Rand) stars as a young woman who wakes up at dawn on the handprints and footprints of the famed Chinese Theatre in Hollywood with no idea who she or how she got there. Upon awakening, she wonders if she isn't, in fact, lost in a dream. And perhaps she is. Regardless of whether she is dreaming or wide awake, Our Gal sets off on her journey, from one person to the next, one famous locale after the other. Among the Hollywood fringe denizens with whom she comes into contact are a pair of tour guides (Charley Rossman, John Brickner), two super hero impersonators (Catherine Bruhier, Riley Weston), a Scientology auditor (Joe Roseto), and a memorabilia shop owner (R.J. Cantu). She also finds herself disquietingly followed by a Stranger (Kirk Bovill) who may be real or a figment of her unsteady imagination. Although her feet only fleetingly leave Hollywood Boulevard, by sundown Our Gal will piece together the revelatory truth about her existence and the reason for her awakening, forcing her to make choices that will literally result in either her life... or death. In their heart-breaking portrayals of two veterans of the boulevard and all it represents, FOOTPRINTS marks the return to the big screen of The Searchers' Pippa Scott and H. M. Wynant (The Twilight Zone, Sam Fuller's Run of the Arrow, Budd Boetticher's Decision at Sundown). -- (c) Paladin</StoryLine>

Not that there is much for them to do, aside from dealing with the occasional drunk, and that's usually O'Shea himself. But strange doings are afoot: the crew of a fishing boat disappears, whales start appearing dead on the shore, a local lobsterman catches a strange tentacled creature in his trap. Soon it becomes clear to O'Shea and Nolan that there's something big out there, and that it's hungry. It's time to rally the villagers, arm the troops...and head to the pub.

            <Review>Wright checks off the expected genre boxes with the gleeful mischief of a gremlin trashing a plane engine.</Review>
            <Review>The movie never aspires to be more than a cookie-cutter creature feature-the kind of film that can be washed back with a pint and then forgotten in the morning.</Review>
            <Review>The tough thing about genre hybrids is that they have to fulfill both genres, and Grabbers only nails one of them.</Review>
            <Review>A polished, watchable genre entertainment that nonetheless lacks the inspired dialogue and situations needed to make a memorable impression.</Review>
            <Review>A group of Irish villagers have to stay drunk to keep alcohol-fearing alien monsters at bay. Yup.</Review>
            <Review>Recommended only for those peering through the thickest of beer goggles.</Review>
            <Review>Grabbers combines horror and comedy into one extremely satisfying octopus-like baby that results in some of the most fun you'll have with any film this year.</Review>
            <Review>Out of all the bad decisions you've drunkenly made, one viewing of Grabbers makes up for the lot of them. With or without beer goggles, Jon Wright's film is equally entertaining - and without any regrets the following morning!</Review>
            <Review>Perfect fodder for a late-night audience, UK/Irish co-production Grabbers, directed by Jon Wright, is a fun ride, and while it doesn't reinvent the "Tremors" and Slither modern-b-movie wheel, it adds a few neat touches to that formula.</Review>
            <Review>The biggest issue with Grabbers is that it's more slick than squirmy. Aside from a few good low-fi gross-out scenes ... Grabbers has the look and style of a big-budget action epic, not a scrappy little indie-horror.</Review>
            <Review>Good, clean genre entertainment, the sort of harmless yet endearing brand of moviemaking seemingly unattainable in today's Hollywood system.</Review>

        <Title>Becoming Traviata</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>112</Duration>
        <StoryLine>The reinvention of Verdi's masterpiece, La Traviata, as sung by world-famous French coloratura soprano Natalie Dessay, is the subject of Philippe B�ziat's thrilling new movie. A modern, minimalist, post-punk approach strips away the opulence and grandiosity associated with operatic productions. Concentrating on director Jean-Fran�ois Sivadier's working relationship with Dessay, the film reveals how two great creative minds build the story of a doomed love affair. The stars rehearse in what look like yoga outfits, on a bare stage, with minimal props. The final production, set against a backdrop of sky and clouds, punctuated by a single chandelier, features Violetta and Alfredo (a darkly gorgeous Charles Castronovo) as the very essence of hipster-chic. Their passion, however, is for the ages. With music performed by the London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Louis Langr�e. (c) Distrib</StoryLine>

            <Review>Watching Dessay work as a real human being and not a glittering vocal princess is a fascinating treat.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is most enjoyable as a simple record of the performers, allowing one to eavesdrop on soprano Natalie Dessay and tenor Charles Castronovo as opera director Jean-Francois Sivadier coaches them through some of the libretto's more layered moments.</Review>
            <Review>You can follow the story even if you're unfamiliar with the opera - though a five-minute brush-up on the plot wouldn't hurt.</Review>
            <Review>Zeroing in on the art of rehearsal, "Becoming Traviata" is an exquisitely observed look at performance and the creative process.</Review>
            <Review>Sivadier and Dessay take the familiar and make it tragic once more.</Review>
            <Review>Doc offers impressive singing and insights into opera's nonmusical dramatic challenges.</Review>
            <Review>Becoming Traviata gives a compelling and rare insight into the daily life of the opera industry from the perspective of a filmmaker.</Review>
            <Review>Béziat arranges an interesting mosaic, moving the opera's narrative forward along the same timeline as the ever-evolving, multi-faceted collaboration.</Review>
            <Review>A clumsy and sadly missed opportunity to capture the creation of a great opera role by a great singer.</Review>
            <Review>Initially engaging, but increasingly tedious and boring. Strictly for opera aficionados.</Review>
            <Review>Dessay's waifishness makes her entirely believable as a woman dying from a lung disease. And the camera adores her. When her voice goes, she could have the career in movies that once seemed to await Maria Callas.</Review>
            <Review>It works as a reminder of the important interactiveness of the performing arts, of actors evoking the drama, action, and emotion that computers and machines cannot.</Review>

            <Review>Essentially a sports documentary with the look and feel of an ESPN program, "Rising from Ashes" nevertheless has broad, inspirational appeal on a human level.</Review>
            <Review>This is an inspiring tale of a nation, and a man, not wanting to be judged by past misdeeds.</Review>
            <Review>Engaging personalities and lively, good-looking assembly make T.C. Johnstone's inspirational sports docu a crowdpleaser.</Review>
            <Review>This feel-good sports doc brings a little-known story to compelling life.</Review>
            <Review>Ashes is joyous and uplifting, full of spirit, memorable athletes (including Olympian Adrien Niyonshuti) and remarkable achievements, both big and small.</Review>
            <Review>Though the subject inspires, Johnstone's treatment lacks focus and edge, falling back on platitudes, sentiment, and generalities when clarity is what is needed.</Review>
            <Review>TC Johnstone's cycling documentary might sound at first like just another sport movie trying hard to seem inspirational, yet this study of the story behind 'Team Rwanda' is indeed just that.</Review>
            <Review>It's hard not to get swept up in this film's sense of hope.</Review>
            <Review>Inspiring, tough-hearted documentary about the formation of the Rwandan cycling team in the wake of the 1994 genocide.</Review>
            <Review>We're invited to bask in the achievements of Team Rwanda, but it's difficult to when confronted with the lingering intrigue surrounding Boyer's story.</Review>
            <Review>So while the subjects explored in Rising from Ashes are worthy of contemplation, the methodology of doing so puts the brakes on the film's ability to inspire and persuade.</Review>
            <Review>The film is beautifully put together, with slick editing and glossy photography. The beauty of Rwanda is astonishing.</Review>

            <Review>"Broadway Idiot" is entertaining enough. Certainly if you're a Green Day fan, it's something close to essential. But it never goes too deeply into anything.</Review>

            <Review>Vibrant &amp; colorful. The documentary emphasizes the positive and tends to gloss over any backstage tensions. Still, it is a fine testament to a great modern musical.</Review>
            <Review>A film about both [creative] challenges and choices... Broadway Idiot does a good job of tapping into the source material's thick veins of feeling.</Review>

            <Review>Broadway Idiot [is] a spirited look at bringing American Idiot to the stage that lacks a strong narrative to propel it forward.</Review>

        <Title>When the Dragon Swallowed the Sun</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2012</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>112</Duration>
        <StoryLine>A groundbreaking documentary that examines these questions in a quest to understand why the world is still dealing with unsettled issues like the Tibetan cause and what can really be done to eradicate them. Seven years in the making, When The Dragon Swallowed The Sun is the first inside look at the Tibetan movement to free Tibet from Chinese occupation, its internal conflicts and contradictions. The combination of full HD footage from India, China, Tibet and the US along with a prologue narrated by Dennis Haysbert and an original soundtrack by Philip Glass, Thom Yorke and Damien Rice make this the first film that presents the complexity of the struggle with such emotional impact. The film features Richard Gere, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the 14th Dalai Lama, the newly crowned 18th descendant of the Great Religious Kings of Tibet, some of the most prominent Chinese contemporary artists, and all the key figures of the exiled Tibetan freedom movement and their followers.</StoryLine>

            <Review>A lengthy, demanding but worthwhile film ... admirably clear-headed about the deep splits within the Tibetan opposition.</Review>
            <Review>You needn't disagree with the film's cause to feel oppressed by its propagandistic approach - not to mention Philip Glass's relentlessly mournful score.</Review>
            <Review>A valuable though flawed documentary about the international movement to free Tibet from Chinese rule ...</Review>
            <Review>An extremely powerful documentary about Tibet's struggle for emancipation from China that's passionate in its plea and highly informative, although slightly bloated.</Review>
            <Review>Good access, good heart, bad craft.</Review>
            <Review>Much of what people say here is maddeningly phased out in favour of oozingly self-righteous music by Philip Glass, precisely what Tibet does not need: an arty score.</Review>
            <Review>The staggering landscapes of this mountainous land are captured beautifully as director Dirk Simon picks apart contradictions within Tibetan society. Philip Glass, Thom Yorke and Damien Rice provide terrific musical accompaniment.</Review>
            <Review>It's a fascinating study of the limits of protest, but also a disjointed film; each new witness shifts us further away from the central thread into increasingly dry political debate.</Review>

            <Review>Berman and Pulcini -- American Splendor, The Nanny Diaries -- found a tone somewhere between tragedy and nonsense.</Review>
            <Review>There are moments to make you honestly wish it were a better movie, and that the semi-autobiographical screenplay by Michelle Morgan didn't feel so much like a first draft.</Review>

            <Review>Kristen Wiig's comic artistry and its melodramatic tinge are squandered in this frenetic, schematic comedy, which also lays waste to a fertile premise.</Review>
            <Review>Nobody in this movie is really appealing enough to be much fun. The state of New Jersey should sue.</Review>
            <Review>"Girl Most Likely" is a strange movie, in that it has the atmosphere of a comedy and some extreme characters set up to be comical, but there are really no funny scenes.</Review>
            <Review>Crushingly unfunny, it's a must to avoid.</Review>

            <Review>Even if you added a laugh track the tone is glum.</Review>
            <Review>A perfectly gauged performance by Wiig holds this ramshackle comedy-drama together, as she plays a woman forced to confront everything she has always hated about herself.</Review>

            <Review>What we have here is a tale of lust, deception, manipulation and murder. Quintessential De Palma, in other words.</Review>
            <Review>One's ultimate reaction is likely to one of indifference, bemusement or outright disdain considering the pedigree of the filmmaker helming the project: Brian De Palma.</Review>
            <Review>A throwaway by a gifted filmmaker who has run out of ideas.</Review>
            <Review>Despite De Palma's lavish proof of what he can accomplish with classical technique, the movie comes off as too much for too little, a collection of mechanisms that decorate mechanisms.</Review>
            <Review>After the clinically dull first half, it's more desperate pantry raid than feast.</Review>
            <Review>Entrancing and narcotizing in about equal measure.</Review>
            <Review>'Passion' is, outside of its cinephile-pleasing gestures, a pretty bad movie. If it bore any other filmmaker's name, would we cut it the same slack?</Review>
            <Review>This trashy agenda could have a certain appeal if it were executed with wry humour or nightmarish obsessiveness -- as in, say, De Palma's Dressed To Kill -- but this time around the whole thing feels so vapid, so dated.</Review>
            <Review>Delirious, exquisite trash.</Review>
            <Review>This film is an old-fashioned glove that still fits De Palma pretty comfortably.</Review>
            <Review>Like late-period Hitchcock, you hang in there because there's enough zing left on the screen to let you know you're watching a real filmmaker at work-but the payoffs never really come and certainly the movie never lives up to its title.</Review>
            <Review>Brian De Palma has enough great movies in his filmography that he can always count on remaining one of my all-time favorite directors. But, man, it sure would be nice if he made at least one wholly successful film in the 21st century.</Review>

            <Review>Sandler's films have always been stupid, but the early stuff is pretty harmless; here the jokes almost always come at the expense of someone else, the kind of needless bullying one expects of a YouTube comment section.</Review>
            <Review>These movies are about four friends -- played by comedians -- remembering what it was like to be young. How much better for an audience would it be if they remembered what it was like to make comedy?</Review>
            <Review>Grown Ups 2 delivers exactly what it's been advertising in trailers and on talk shows: grubby low-comic escapism.</Review>
            <Review>This is pap, plain and simple: scattered raunch-lite devoid of emotional resonance.</Review>
            <Review>It makes the first movie look like The Maltese Falcon.</Review>
            <Review>A movie of fools, by fools, for fools.</Review>
            <Review>It's not terribly deep and insightful, as moments in The Way, Way Back are, but Grown Ups 2 is comfortable and, at times, genuinely hilarious.</Review>
            <Review>Few of the characters' actions make any sense, be it in the context of Hollywood clichés, real life, or anything even resembling reality.</Review>
            <Review>It's a shame how lazy and pointless Grown Ups 2 is.</Review>
            <Review>Laziness wafts from the screen like a foul odor.</Review>
            <Review>[A] slothful, indulgent sequel that sees a once-great screen comedian hit self-inflicted Sandlergeddon.</Review>
            <Review>Rob Schneider, the butt of many jokes in the first Grown-Ups, is nowhere to be seen. Salma Hayek, as Lenny's wife, looks understandably tense and irritable throughout.</Review>

            <Review>The special effects are scary-hairy enough to satisfy the midsummer "I wish to go to the moon" impulse.</Review>
            <Review>The main flaw of White House Down is that it overstays its welcome, thanks in large part to a silly climax that seems to unfold in three laborious acts.</Review>
            <Review>Essentially a louder, sillier version of Die Hard, with John Cale standing in for John McClane, a precocious daughter standing in for the plucky wife, and, alas, no one even much trying to stand in for Alan Rickman's deliciously wicked Hans Gruber.</Review>
            <Review>It follows the Emmerich template: a spectacle-tinged, compelling setup; a dumb, disappointing midsection; and a cheese-topped denouement that veers so close to self-parody that one is tempted to call it funny.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately, I was bored by White House Down, which is pretty much inexcusable given the level of sublime idiocy on display.</Review>
            <Review>The script reads as if it was written by a college freshman who just got his first taste of Zinn and Chomsky.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>90</Duration>
        <StoryLine>The summer holidays have just begun and 11 year-old Skunk's afternoons are full of day dreams and curious wanderings around her neighborhood - with the exception that she must regularly give herself injections to combat her type 1 diabetes. When, one day, Skunk (Eloise Laurence) discovers her bitter and angry older neighbor, Mr. Oswald (Rory Kinnear), savagely beating Rick, a psychologically-troubled boy from the neighborhood whom Mr. Oswald's daughter has callously and fictitiously accused of rape, Skunk's innocence begins to vanish. Trying to find solace with her loving nanny (Zana Marjanovic) and father (Tim Roth), with whom she is very close, Skunk is unwittingly drawn into her neighbors' unfolding melodrama involving violence, sex, and life-shattering illness. Her home, her neighborhood and her school all become treacherous environments where the happy certainties of childhood give way to a fear-filled doubt, and the promise of a complex, broken future. Overwhelmed by her experiences, Skunk herself is drawn into an ethereal chaos from which she may only return through the intense love of those closest to her. (c) Film Movement</StoryLine>

            <Review>"Broken'' embraces the sort of unappealing British miserabilism perfected by "Ratcatcher" director Lynne Ramsay.</Review>
            <Review>At a certain point, Mr. Norris forsakes realism for theatricalized fantasy, and "Broken" ultimately loses its stylistic cohesion, if not its humanity.</Review>
            <Review>Shot with a lovely warm hue by Rob Hardy, Broken has enough great moments to make it worthwhile. Yet, the naggingly problematic final sequences leave a bitter taste. Do they undo a solid first hour? That's up to the individual viewer.</Review>
            <Review>Broken simply can't get it together on any level, delivering a tedious drama, that for all the characters and over-emoting, doesn't have much to say.</Review>
            <Review>A startlingly natural performance by Ms. Laurence, along with her superb supporting cast under the mostly spot-on direction by Norris, help make all the Sturm und Drang that occurs within 'Broken' extremely palatable.</Review>
            <Review>If not for Laurence's bemused, slowly comprehending take on all the drama around her, "Broken" would seem to wallow in misery.</Review>
            <Review>Broken is close to being a great little film.</Review>
            <Review>While the third-act meltdown badly damages the movie, it doesn't erase the assured, preternatural confidence that first-time director Rufus Norris demonstrates before the material finally overwhelms him.</Review>

            <Review>Seyfried, with her huge features crowding her small face, looks like Alice in a very strange Wonderland. But whatever possibilities she may have as an actress are eradicated by the filmmakers ...</Review>
            <Review>Linda's feelings are rarely revealed: that's left to the gloomy final act, which feels more like a guilt-inducing postscript than a genuine reveal.</Review>
            <Review>"Lovelace" becomes too distracted by industry politics and the cultural context of the film's release to provide more than a snapshot of her life either before or after she stepped in front of a camera.</Review>
            <Review>Lovelace bids to whip up hot indignation about an outrage four decades old. Instead, it provokes dismay.</Review>
            <Review>Unfortunately, most of Lovelace is more generic and familiar, right down to the too-neat happy ending.</Review>
            <Review>This drama from codirectors Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman is so respectful of 70s porn sensation Linda Lovelace that instead of humanizing the Deep Throat star, it reduces her to one dimension: victim.</Review>
            <Review>Lovelace isn't a catalyst; it's just another unchallenging fantasy.</Review>
            <Review>Ironically, even a movie about Linda Lovelace's rather sad life uses her more for her body than her character.</Review>
            <Review>Amanda Seyfried is a game performer, and the Linda-like freckles sprayed across her cheeks, which all and sundry in the film comment on, are fetching.</Review>
            <Review>Amanda Seyfried acts out of her skin.</Review>
            <Review>I understand that movies based on true stories take plenty of liberties, but if those liberties can be blown apart with a five-minute visit to Wikipedia, they went too far.</Review>
            <Review>Other performances may be more gripping in the moment, but the core of relatable vulnerability and flawed humanity Seyfried brings lends the film a lasting resonance.</Review>

            <Review>Kennedy specialists will glean nothing new, and those hoping for sobriety will flinch at the camera's intrusions.</Review>
            <Review>This episodic drama is set in Dallas during the three days after the JFK assassination, and some of it is highly charged.</Review>
            <Review>Somehow, all this commotion adds up to aimless inertia, in part because the movie lacks a point of view - let alone anything fresh to propose about the assassination or its peripheral players.</Review>
            <Review>Takes one of the most traumatizing events of the American 20th century and turns it into a trivia digest.</Review>
            <Review>"Parkland" expends lots of energy and expertise on re-creating these infamous events, yet it is so lacking in narrative purpose that many viewers are likely to leave muttering, "Okay...but so what?"</Review>
            <Review>Parkland is history as existential despair.</Review>
            <Review>The performances are powerful, the authenticity is admirable, and the tone remains objective in its depiction of events throughout.</Review>
            <Review>A ( ... ) pragmatic, four-day, fly-on-the-wall view of Dallas when the 20th Century's most documented death arguably facilitated the birth of 24-hour rolling news, citizen journalism and You Tube.</Review>
            <Review>Had Landesman spent a bit more time on his characters and narrative, he might have made a more watchable movie.</Review>
            <Review>I suppose each generation gets the JFK movie it deserves. We should feel lucky to get this one.</Review>
            <Review>Parkland is a movie of simple motives. It doesn't waste time with pomp or theory, and the material is acted by those who connect with the characters like reflections in the mirror.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately Parkland is not thought-provoking, inspiring or even brave enough to be offensive, but it does raise some interesting scenarios and is full of some very solid acting.</Review>

            <Review>In the end, you simply wish the characters (and the actors) were in a more subtle and focused film. "Computer Chess" plays a risky game. Unfortunately, it loses.</Review>
            <Review>A supremely intelligent, beautifully constructed film, interweaving comedy and character, satire and subtext</Review>
            <Review>A breakthrough -- not just for indie writer-director Andrew Bujalski, but for American movie comedy.</Review>
            <Review>It's impossible not to see "Computer Chess" as both a humble, low-fi ode to evanescence and the deceptively cute baby picture of the digital disrupters who will soon bestride the Earth.</Review>
            <Review>A shambling, Altmanesque ensemble comedy.</Review>
            <Review>You need no particular knowledge or affection for the game of kings to appreciate the whimsy of "Computer Chess."</Review>
            <Review>The movie seems like something retrieved from a thirty-five-year-old time capsule, which, in terms of the speed of technological change over that period, might have been light years away.</Review>
            <Review>It's the type of film that introduces a type of funny that you didn't know existed, that isn't based in popular culture or punchlines or pratfalls or virtually anything that we've seen before.</Review>
            <Review>Those weird elements don't take over the film, but they certainly make it a more delirious experience. It helps, though, that it's still grounded by real-feeling characters and an offbeat, low-key sense of humor.</Review>
            <Review>Might bore viewers like myself who are not chess or techie knowledgeable.</Review>
            <Review>Strange, hilarious and curiously moving.</Review>
            <Review>As much as it is comedy, Computer Chess is also a treatise on isolation, social hierarchy and the crippling male fear of inadequacy</Review>

        <Title>As I Lay Dying</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>120</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Directed by Oscar-nominated James Franco from a screenplay by James Franco and Matt Rager, As I Lay Dying is adapted from the 1930 classic American novel by William Faulkner. The story chronicles the Bundren family as they traverse the Mississippi countryside to bring the body of their deceased mother Addie to her hometown for burial. Addie's husband Anse and their children, Cash, Darl, Jewel, Dewey Dell, and the youngest one Vardaman, leave the farm on a carriage with her coffin - each affected by Addie's death in a profound and different way. Their road trip to Jefferson, some forty miles away, is disrupted by every antagonistic force of nature or man: flooded rivers, injury and accident, a raging barn fire, and not least of all -- each individual character's personal turmoil and inner commotion which at times threaten the fabric of the family more than any outside force.(c) Millenium</StoryLine>

            <Review>I don't pretend to have a clue how to adapt William Faulkner's "As I Lay Dying" for the screen, but unlike James Franco, I, at least, didn't try.</Review>
            <Review>As a whole ... "As I Lay Dying" conveys some of Faulkner's themes, and the details of the Bundren family story, with clarity and concision.</Review>
            <Review>It remains to be seen whether James Franco can live up to his outsized ambitions.</Review>
            <Review>Like Franco's other directorial efforts, it ends up coming across as an academic art object, somewhere halfway between a graduate thesis and a video installation-interesting, but only in context.</Review>
            <Review>Faulkner fans... need not be up in arms about this version of his Nobel Prize winner.</Review>
            <Review>The past may never be done with us, but Lord, do we wish Franco was done with our literary heritage.</Review>
            <Review>As I Lay Dying tries to adapt the impossible, but unfortunately it is bested by Faulkner's weighty source material.</Review>
            <Review>Some of the filming techniques are overused and the monologues are a bit too circuitous, but As I Lay Dying has the ability to be quite striking at times and its impulsive structure can be viewed as both an asset and a defect.</Review>
            <Review>A qualified, perfectly respectable success</Review>
            <Review>Both brilliant and maddening</Review>
            <Review>What Franco came up with... is messy, bizarre, muted, and confusing, but it's also heartfelt and personal. It takes more risks than most movies.</Review>
            <Review>Franco may prove that he has a fresh visual eye, but the highly emotive story is oddly uninvolving.</Review>

            <Review>It will take only a few minutes of Clear History... not only to "forgive" David for repeating himself but to thank him for reminding us why we miss Curb Your Enthusiasm and hope it comes back soon.</Review>
            <Review>[It] has a nice, confident and well-edited breeze to it (including a lot of jokes about the band Chicago), with a fun cast that includes standout riffs from Michael Keaton, Danny McBride and Eva Mendes.</Review>
            <Review>A wonderfully diverting film with Mr. David at his abrasive best.</Review>
            <Review>If you're a fan of Curb Your Enthusiasm, think of this as an extended version of Curb. If you're not, History will not convert you.</Review>
            <Review>Clear History was improvised from 35 pages of script. "You are such an asshole!" one Vineyard resident tells Flomm, which is the movie's main revelation.</Review>
            <Review>Even if you do like David's shtick, as I do, you have no business here.</Review>
            <Review>For those of us who agree with Mel Brooks that "there's something about this middle-aged bald guy that's thrilling," his new film is a high-spirited treat - and a hint at the possibilities that await him if and when he finally calls it a day on 'Curb.'</Review>
            <Review>Because HBO will basically let him do whatever he wants, Larry David passed up making another season of Curb Your Enthusiasm to instead write and star in this semi-improvised feature that has an A-list cast and C-list material.</Review>
            <Review>With a cast this capable and a screenplay invested in unusual topics for comedic dissection, the feature does just fine as a platform for David to continue his career quest to perfect the art of unease.</Review>
            <Review>True to its improv style, the story meanders, but the jokes swirl and land more often than they miss</Review>
            <Review>Fans of Larry David could easily be won over by Clear History but ultimately, a fun cast and genuine laughs are unable to outshine its many inconsistencies.</Review>
            <Review>There's enough here to still merit a curious click, but Clear History may not be what hardcore David acolytes most crave.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Based on the best-selling book, SYRUP is an edgy comedy that exposes the cut-throat world of advertising through the eyes of a young prodigy chasing fame, fortune, and the woman of his dreams. Fresh out of school with a degree in marketing, Scat will do anything to prove that he has what it takes to swim with the rich and wildly successful. Scat comes up with a brilliant new product that gives new meaning to the old saying "sex sells." He is sure it will send him right to the top...if only he can convince his boss, the beautiful and mysterious "6," that it's an idea worth millions. Betrayed by his best friend "Sneaky Pete," Scat stumbles through an industry riddled with deception. As he begins to realize that fame and fortune have cost him his morality, he must rediscover his true self behind the elaborate image he has created or risk losing the love of his life. In a world where the average person sees over eight hundred ads in a single day, SYRUP takes a biting look at the insidious-and often ridiculous-side of advertising. Crackling with romance and humor, this razor-sharp satire leaves you guessing and laughing until the end. (c) Magnolia</StoryLine>

            <Review>Syrup is an unsatisfying blend of romantic comedy and scathing social satire, slamming the high-stakes games of product marketing and sales.</Review>
            <Review>The actors are young and beautiful, the soundtrack kicks and the camera zips around with precision. But the script never seems to match the carefully orchestrated mood.</Review>

            <Review>A great performance from Amber Heard can't save Syrup from its half-baked, sluggish script and obnoxious complacency.</Review>
            <Review>It's a spunky film, but only in frustrating fits, with the majority of the feature overly concerned with its appearance, generating a sliver of irony to go with all the mediocrity.</Review>

        <Duration>73</Duration>
        <StoryLine>It is instantly recognizable - musical shorthand for anything Jewish, a happy party tune that you dance to at weddings, bar mitzvahs and even at Major League Baseball games. It conjures up wistful smiles, memories of generations past...and no shortage of eye rolling. But as audiences will discover in Hava Nagila (The Movie), the song is much more than a tale of Jewish kitsch and bad bar mitzvah fashions. It carries with it an entire constellation of history, values and hopes for the future. In its own believe-it-or-not way, Hava Nagila encapsulates the Jewish journey over the past 150 years. It also reveals the power of one song to express and sustain identity, to transmit lessons across generations and to bridge cultural divides and connect us all on a universal level.

        <StoryLine>A popular Psychology professor at a prestigious East Coast college must face the demons of her distant family past when confronted by a disgruntled former student who has taken her classroom hostage. Suzanne Hollander (Katie Sackhoff) was just a young girl when she watched her mother kill her father in cold blood. As a result, Suzanne grew up fascinated by the mechanics of the human mind. Years later, she's turned that fascination into a successful career in psychology. An esteemed professor, Suzanne is in the midst of giving a lecture when gun shots ring out. In the process of evacuating her students, Suzanne finds that one of them has been badly wounded. Meanwhile, with the school on lockdown, Suzanne's boyfriend Logan schemes to get inside with the help of Police Lieutenant Michael Olsen. What Logan and Lieutenant Olsen have failed to realize, however, is that the gunman is a former student of Suzanne's named Connor who's grown dangerously obsessed with her. Now the only way for Suzanne to stop Logan is to confront him directly, but should she make one false move, the situation could quickly become a bloodbath. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>88</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Ricky Jay is a world-renowned magician, author, historian and actor (often a mischievous presence in the films of David Mamet and Paul Thomas Anderson) -- and a performer who regularly provokes astonishment from even the most jaded audiences. DECEPTIVE PRACTICE traces Jay's achievements and influences, from his apprenticeship at age 4 with his grandfather, to such now-forgotten legends as Al Flosso, Slydini, Cardini and his primary mentors, Dai Vernon and Charlie Miller. Featuring rare footage from his 1970s TV appearances (doing 3-card Monte with Steve Martin on The Dinah Shore Show) and told in Jay's inimitable voice, this is a remarkable journey inside the secretive world of magic and the small circle of eccentrics who are its perpetual devotees.

            <Review>Jay's own personality and intellect steer the film, and he's such a finely honed performer that he easily carries it off...What we get here, simply, is time spent with Ricky Jay, and that's time well spent.</Review>

            <Review>For heaven's sake! Another documentary I didn't know I was waiting for-and am equally glad to see.</Review>
            <Review>The magic in this documentary portrait of actor and stage illusionist Ricky Jay comes mainly from his fond recollections of old performers.</Review>

            <Review>The splendid feats and dazzling card magic direct our attention away from the inner life of a large, glowering and cryptic figure. You learn a lot from Jay, and yet he keeps his mystique.</Review>

            <Review>I watched this movie with three chatty strangers on [a] Thursday night in an otherwise empty theater. Universal couldn't say "no." Looks like that's our job now.</Review>
            <Review>This spends little time on exposition and doesn't go in for any false pathos; compared with most recent comic-book movies, this is lean, unpretentious filmmaking--and to my taste, a lot more fun for it.</Review>
            <Review>Images of Jeff Bridges enjoying himself are almost enough to make a movie work. "R.I.P.D." does its best to stop him dead in his tracks.</Review>
            <Review>Too bad director Robert Schwentke ("RED") and the writing team handling the 3-D screen adaptation don't hold up their end, failing to do much with a premise that felt like it could rate with, say, "Men in Black."</Review>
            <Review>Mr. Bridges is almost always fun to watch, but even his squinting and Slim Pickens-style whooping can't make the time pass faster.</Review>
            <Review>A half-hour into the film, and it feels like the eighth day of jury duty.</Review>
            <Review>What we are left with is a mildly entertaining, utterly harmless mid-summer blockbuster that marks another misstep in the career of Ryan Reynolds.</Review>
            <Review>Bake a 'Men In Black' pie; throw in some 'Ghostbusters,' 'This Is the End,' 'True Grit,' and 'Weeds,' drain the fun out, and you get the half-baked, derivative 'R.I.P.D.'</Review>
            <Review>The kind of terrible that doesn't wash out, destined to be remembered among the pantheon of big budget bombs like "The Adventures Of Pluto Nash" and "Cutthroat Island."</Review>
            <Review>It's not a buddy-cop movie, nor is it an action movie. It's just one vaguely funny joke told for 98 minutes.</Review>
            <Review>It's a predictable and cliché filled soap opera mess played straight with an afterlife gimmick.</Review>
            <Review>a film so preoccupied with style, (the stars) wander around the film without anything of note to do</Review>

            <Review>Jordan is no stranger to the yearnings of vampires. He directed Interview With the Vampire. But Byzantium is a kinder, gentler yet pretty durn bloody affair.</Review>
            <Review>Go ahead, bite.</Review>
            <Review>A drama that feels both strenuously earnest and impossible to take seriously.</Review>
            <Review>Byzantium has a few moves that might surprise you. They have nothing to do with blood, but everything to do with the heart.</Review>
            <Review>A confusing yet eye-pleasing tale that struggles to breathe new life into the well-worn mythology.</Review>
            <Review>Neil Jordan's sensitive and very slow exploration of vampire angst. That the film also seems intended as some kind of vampire feminist statement makes it a rare combination of mildly boring and mildly hilarious.</Review>
            <Review>[Clara and Eleanor] are not technically human, but it's the human relationship between them that the film is confident to show us. And Byzantium seems most comfortable, most intimate, when its two bright actresses give us just that.</Review>
            <Review>Some "vampire stuff" you've seen before, a few new ideas that work, two great performances, and a lot of skilled veterans behind the camera.</Review>
            <Review>evenly split between a character piece and a mystery thriller...if you're looking for an interesting and different take on vampire legend, check into the Byzantium...</Review>
            <Review>Byzantium is a refreshing take on the vampire genre.</Review>
            <Review>Although audience fatigue regarding vampires has surely set in...this is a romantic, sensual, bloody good time of a movie for sophisticated adults.</Review>
            <Review>As the feature jumps backwards and forwards in time, and stories within stories coalesce, a striking tapestry is woven illustrating a world where eternal beings struggle with great change. Jordan's vampiric universe is bloody, adult, and melancholy.</Review>

            <Review>Non-Bruce fans or casual fans may want to check this film out, but it's really for true believers. If it never explains why they're true believers, the real truth is that it doesn't matter.</Review>
            <Review>Springsteen and I gathers these homemade tributes into an effusive feature that will resonate with the kind of die-hard Boss fans who helped make it, but quickly grows tiresome for the less devout among us.</Review>
            <Review>There are, however, a couple of bits that seem to get to the heart of Springsteen's singular place in the pop music world.</Review>
            <Review>Springsteen &amp; I captures rock-star and rock-fan power and resolve at its funniest, grittiest and most profound.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is essentially made by Springsteen fans, so naturally it's pretty much made for Springsteen fans. Haters need not apply.</Review>
            <Review>"Springsteen &amp; I" can be entertaining. But it never rises above the level of the sort of bonus DVD you sometimes get free with a new album.</Review>
            <Review>You pity the kids of the more Boss-obsessed but there's pomposity-pricking humour and uplift here, too.</Review>
            <Review>As much as it's a love letter to Springsteen (who provided footage but reportedly had no editorial control over the content), it's also a love letter from fans to fans.</Review>
            <Review>It's a quirky little film, at turns charming and creepy but ultimately redeeming, about people who are extremely devoted to the 63-year-old rock star.</Review>
            <Review>The fans are fun but the archival footage, including a large chunk of a live show that will play after the film to boost its meager running time, is the real draw.</Review>
            <Review>Nice, if you like that sort of thing.</Review>

            <Review>It's one of the most powerful films about the Arab-Israeli conflict that has ever been attempted on the screen.</Review>
            <Review>"Out in the Dark" isn't a political film by any stretch, but the intrigue and prejudices of the Arab-Israeli conflict certainly fuel the romance and thrills of this entertaining, taut movie.</Review>
            <Review>By the end, Nimr and Roy have become heavy-handed symbols for the ongoing clash of ideologies in the Middle East. "Out in the Dark" fared better when it treated them as people.</Review>
            <Review>Even though the plot defies credibility at several points, "Out in the Dark" is gripping, and Nimr's tearful exile from his family breaks your heart.</Review>
            <Review>Tel Aviv and the West Bank may be worlds apart in terms of culture, politics and religion, but Mayer cleverly merges them into a single claustrophobic continuum of paranoia, violence and corruption that corrodes everything it touches.</Review>
            <Review>Ratchets up the tension on its appealing lead characters in believable, heartfelt ways while spinning out an edgy tale fueled by do-or-die sociopolitical intrigue. It's unique, powerful stuff.</Review>
            <Review>I enjoyed this one quite a bit it was the ending that struck me as the most impressive.</Review>

            <Review>The best gay-themed films I've yet seen this year.</Review>
            <Review>Instead of looking for depth or verisimilar romance, director Michael Mayer turns his characters into mere cogs in a pseudo-suspenseful thriller.</Review>
            <Review>Though it's rather clumsily scripted, formulaic in structure and sometimes contrived, Out In The Dark is strengthened by its subtext and elevated by tender, affecting performances from the leads.</Review>

            <Review>Intentionally cheap, silly and bloody from beginning to end, "Bounty Killer" is custom-made for those seeking out self-aware garbage. To those: enjoy! To all others: beware.</Review>
            <Review>It isn't the worst thing to blow an hour and a half on a film where everyone - including supporting players Gary Busey, Beverly D'Angelo and Kristanna Loken - seems to be having a good time.</Review>
            <Review>Bounty Killer quite literally is a live action representation of a comic book's cells that make us turn each page.</Review>
            <Review>It's violent, silly, and disgracefully entertaining.</Review>
            <Review>Mad Max and Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! are just a couple of the exploitation flicks that come to mind in this entertaining slice of low-budget mayhem.</Review>
            <Review>Like a spoof mash-up of Mad Max and Machete, this nutty action movie throws us into a Wild West dystopia with enough wit and energy to overcome its clunky production values.</Review>
            <Review>Borrowing heavily from Roger Corman and Mad Max, this self-aware action-com keeps tongue firmly in cheek as blood sprays all over the desert.</Review>
            <Review>This slurry of B-movie hackwork boasts the odd spark of originality amid the full-bore blood-letting.</Review>

            <Review>It is essentially Revenge of the Nerds, with fur. And scales. And whatever gooey, gelatinous substance comprises the outer coating of various other oddball creatures in this crazy parallel world.</Review>
            <Review>Studios don't often seem to be thinking about the ideal moviegoer, just about the maximum number of moviegoers ... Pixar is no different in that regard, but even in this relatively fallow period ... it's never stopped thinking the most of us.</Review>
            <Review>It has enough of the right stuff to haunt the imagination long after the immediate buzz of its fluffy-furred cuteness has melted away. For a mere prequel, that's a result.</Review>
            <Review>This is a safe, predictable, edge-free, nearly bland effort from a studio that rarely hedges its bets.</Review>
            <Review>As prequels go, Monsters University is pretty nifty.</Review>
            <Review>Although it falls short of the best Pixar has brought to the screen over its long association with Disney, it's nevertheless worth a trip to the theater, especially for kids.</Review>
            <Review>This is the ingenuity and warmth we love in Pixar movies, and long may it remain.</Review>
            <Review>Mike and Sully went to college; both "scare majors." But Sully's a talented, no-work-ethic scare-scion, and little Mike's an overachiever with no scare-ability. Teamwork!</Review>
            <Review>Great Randy Newman score, some inspired sight gags, and a sure way to let your 6-year-old learn early on that school is all about cliques, and that the people who tend to run in them are often jerks.</Review>
            <Review>Breezy and charming enough to warrant a viewing - especially for younger audiences.</Review>
            <Review>It's like an animated Revenge of the Nerds, but without the vulgarity and compromising situations.</Review>
            <Review>Much to the surprise of moviegoers, the film turns out to be an anti-Disney anti-fairy tale in which you don't get special treatment even if you are special, but you can still achieve your goal even if life isn't the way you've planned.</Review>

            <Review>The trailer for The Conjuring is scarier than most horror features of recent vintage, and the feature makes good on the promise.</Review>
            <Review>Every hand that reaches into a wardrobe, every nervous trip into that basement just gets on your nerves. Satan needs to get over himself.</Review>
            <Review>In The Conjuring, the scary casts out the spirit of the silly, permanently, and with a vengeance.</Review>
            <Review>The Conjuring uses every stock scare in the horror movie playbook for a dumb, yet charmingly traditional haunted house picture that manages to feel more retro than rehashed.</Review>
            <Review>Wan builds mounting dread with silence and suspense, lingering the camera unsettlingly long here, creaking a door there.</Review>
            <Review>Wan ... builds the many bumps in the night into a small Hitchcockian symphony of terror by way of long, eerie tracking shots, dramatic silences, and sudden scares that are frighteningly immersive.</Review>
            <Review>The Conjuring is a memorably spooky event; a campfire tale told with a breathless adamancy that stirs the hackles and attacks the imagination.</Review>
            <Review>This is no classic, but director James Wan is a deft conductor who orchestrates the scariest ride of the season from threads of familiarly black melodies.</Review>
            <Review>At best, "The Conjuring" is a drop or two of rain in the middle of a decades-long horror drought. It won't tide anyone over for more than a couple hours.</Review>
            <Review>A movie that exemplifies the golden standards of the haunted house formula and escalates them to something rather rousing.</Review>
            <Review>By all means, feel free to initially underrate this finely crafted and genuinely scary production. Making such a mistake will only serve to leave you more impressed (and slightly rattled) than you might have been.</Review>
            <Review>An old-fashioned haunted house horror story made by people who love them. Classy, creepy, fun.</Review>

            <Review>Directors are always digging around in their psyches for material - David Lynch, Alejandro Jodorowsky, Lars von Trier ... Refn's anxiety seems out to top theirs. But there's no joy or folly or transcendence. It's a one-dimensional video game of death.</Review>
            <Review>Ryan Gosling and his "Drive" director, Nicolas Winding Refn, sail into the heart of darkness and emerge with a trinket of crackpot porno kitsch.</Review>
            <Review>Style over substance doesn't really tell the half of it: you can bathe a corpse in groovy light and dress it in an expensive suit, but in the end that rotting smell just won't go away.</Review>
            <Review>This is one of the most shocking and one of the best movies of the year.</Review>
            <Review>Refn's nerve is admirable, even if his film often borders on unwatchable.</Review>
            <Review>The most objectionable thing about Only God Forgives isn't that it's shocking or immoral, but that it's so finally, fatally dull.</Review>
            <Review>This is more a horror film than a martial arts extravaganza.</Review>
            <Review>'Only God Forgives' is a mess, an overly stylized and brutally violent mood piece with something to alienate everyone. It's also absolutely worth seeing.</Review>
            <Review>That it is superficial is a given. It's clear that Refn's plan is to drug us into transcendence, into the eerie plains of his Norse parable Valhalla Rising. He wants this film to levitate, but it doesn't.</Review>
            <Review>That the pacing is glacial hardly matters - at least for the first hour or so - because Larry Smith's cinematography is so breathtaking.</Review>
            <Review>Only God Forgives is an extremely misunderstood film.</Review>
            <Review>Even as their shadows fall across these walls, the characters are not supermen; they're humans reduced to chiaroscuro. Characterization is even more minimal.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Set in the not so distant future, sixteen year old Herman Howards enters his suburban school and kills thirty nine students, two teachers, and a police officer. Just before his arrest he emails his idol, famous journalist Lax Morales, sending him clips of the shootings captured with Herman's own digital camera. In the clips Herman tells Lax, "I want to tell my story on your show". Hello Herman explores why and how a massacre like this can happen in our society, desensitization in America, youth violence and bulling, the impact of the media and ultimately our need for connection.

            <Review>The dialogue is all surface: Emotions are laid out on the autopsy table for the audience to dissect and analyze, but rarely feel.</Review>
            <Review>Hello Herman suffers not so much from its boldly stated anti-bullying agenda but from its failure to come to any conclusions.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Love is not luck...it's strategy. When IT guy Josh finds out his secret office crush has posted a "missed connections" ad to find the ideal man she bumped into for a minute, he decides to post his own ad to woo her. When that idea goes all wrong, Josh's mistake unexpectedly brings him closer to his beloved than he ever dreamed. Jon Abrahams (Hitchcock), Mickey Sumner (Imogene, CBGB), and Julia Jones (The Twilight Saga: Eclipse) star in this vibrant romantic comedy about the lengths New Yorkers go to find love. The film also stars Malcolm Barrett and Waris Aluwahlia. (c) FilmBuff</StoryLine>

            <Review>"I Give It a Year" is a smart farce that would make Hugh Grant and his fans proud.</Review>
            <Review>Mazer's previous onscreen experience is undeniably obvious. No penis is left unfilmed, no crude scene prevented from going on far too long.</Review>
            <Review>In addition to some trite set pieces, writer-director Dan Mazer serves up nothing more than conspicuous cynicism masquerading as comedy.</Review>
            <Review>The tonal clash is jarring, and Mazer doesn't help matters by erring on the side of blandness.</Review>
            <Review>Can a comedy be too funny for its own good?</Review>
            <Review>It's not romantic in the slightest, and it is quite comedic on occasion, but the parts don't fit together at all.</Review>
            <Review>Any film that makes Rose Byrne unappealing has its head well and truly up its bum.</Review>
            <Review>Clumsy and cute - that's my concise review of regular Sacha Baron Cohen collaborator Dan Mazer's directorial debut I Give It a Year.</Review>

            <Review>You don't need a heart to like this movie. You need an MBA.</Review>
            <Review>Similar to Eddie Murphy's hard right turn from daring and profane comedy to family-friendly romps, Vaughn and Wilson have gone all soft and gooey here.</Review>
            <Review>It's a testament to the duo's jazzy comic chemistry that they wring some laughs from this dated, frankly sinister premise.</Review>
            <Review>There are plenty of films out there competing for your money ... 'The Internship' doesn't even deserve a part-time gig ...</Review>
            <Review>Like many an intern, this sweet, negligible comedy, starring Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson as Google's oldest interns, doesn't live up to its potential.</Review>
            <Review>One of those movies that milks its stars' inherent charisma for as long as it can, but it does so mainly because it has little else.</Review>
            <Review>For the most part The Internship succeeds because of a feel-good vibe that resonates from beginning to end.</Review>
            <Review>Fans of Vaughn and Wilson shouldn't expect the highs of "Wedding Crashers," but as far as amiability goes it's almost off the charts.</Review>
            <Review>"The Internship" is less a pageant of Google's products and services than an agitprop of the company's corporate philosophy and culture.</Review>
            <Review>It isn't really a movie about friendship or new beginnings - it's a movie about selling Google.</Review>
            <Review>'The Internship' isn't as funny or exuberant as 'Wedding Crashers' and the plot is formulaic, but as lightweight entertainment goes it's . . . well, light and entertaining.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>The film has been complacently concocted for likability even as it gives you very little that's real, structured, or spontaneous enough to enjoy.</Review>
            <Review>Nice comedic work from Sam Rockwell and Allison Janney buoys this pleasant but routine coming-of-age drama by Nat Faxon and Jim Rash.</Review>
            <Review>This film's masterstroke is showing everything from Duncan's point of view, without the traditional cloying narration.</Review>
            <Review>Like many of the best films in this genre The Way, Way Back is rooted in truth: honest observations about family dynamics, adolescence, dependence and independence.</Review>
            <Review>An unexpected yet irresistible cross between Meatballs and The Ice Storm, The Way Way Back just may be the best movie of the summer.</Review>
            <Review>The coming-of-age tale The Way, Way Back is sweet, heartfelt and utterly trite and predictable from beginning to end.</Review>
            <Review>Carell convincingly plays against type, Rockwell turns in one of his finest performances to date, and the picture's younger cast members uniformly impress.</Review>
            <Review>The Way Way Back has its heaviness, but in the end it floats to the surface and lodges.</Review>
            <Review>An astoundingly sweet, lovable, immensely enjoyable little film that hits all the right notes as you're watching it thanks to its excellent cast.</Review>
            <Review>The story has some of the lighthearted fun a boy should have working for a fun-loving boss and enjoying the company of a hot girlfriend, but he should be having a lot more fun than this.</Review>
            <Review>This coming-of-age comedy/drama rings emotionally false during many of its jacked-up, stacked-deck emotional confrontations and mistakes obnoxiousness for personality in almost every adult character.</Review>
            <Review>If you're first act was writing the Oscar winning screenplay for "The Descendants," looking for an encore can be tough. But Nat Faxon and Jim Rash leveraged that win and made the leap to directing their own small-budget, bighearted coming of age comedy.</Review>

            <Review>Like belly-dancing itself, this drama is meant for the soul, not the mind - or as Marilyn's instructor commands, "Brains! Stop using them!"</Review>
            <Review>The problem with the film, directed by France's Rachid Bouchareb from a script by Joelle Touma and Marion Doussot, is that the men are mostly one-dimensional louts.</Review>
            <Review>This well-intentioned buddy-road-trip flick lacks the danger, the drama and the sex appeal that most moviegoers will be looking for.</Review>
            <Review>Just like its meaningless title, Rachid Bouchareb's disappointing drama evokes better works without developing any distinct identity of its own.</Review>
            <Review>Bouchareb fails to turn his outsider's point of view into new insights, and instead takes the easy route, falling back on familiar stereotypes in his tour of US misogyny and xenophobia.</Review>
            <Review>It's a shame Ms. Miller has to try so hard, to grimace so much, to add emotional embellishment to compensate for a weak script.</Review>
            <Review>... completely falls apart amid a collection of heavy-handed cliches.</Review>
            <Review>Although branded throughout by a heavily mournful identification with these terribly wronged women's plights, the film is nevertheless silly in the extreme.</Review>
            <Review>Not enough happens on this empowerment road trip to fill even a sub-90-minute running time, and the climax resorts to trite, unearned melodrama.</Review>
            <Review>While one can sympathize with the subjects Bouchareb is exploring here, his picture strives for a great deal more than it actually delivers.</Review>
            <Review>A phony, tone-deaf female fantasy.</Review>
            <Review>[Miller and Farahani] give strong performances as women bonding over their delight in both movement and their own beauty.</Review>

        <StoryLine>OKA! is a fish-out-of-water tale of a ethnomusicologist from New Jersey who finds himself immersed in the colorful lives of the Bayake pygmies. Based on the memoir by ethnomusicologist Louis Sarno, who has lived with the pygmies for over 20 years, OKA! transports audiences to the vast forest of the Central African Republic into the magical world of the Bayaka and lyrically captures their music, dance, humor and exuberance, as well as the harsh realities they endure. -- (C) DADA Films</StoryLine>

            <Review>It's a pleasant, if slow-moving, trip down a lazy river.</Review>
            <Review>The plot is somewhat pedestrian and the dialogue needs more zip.</Review>
            <Review>Oka! is a fascinating movie with many free-form charms.</Review>
            <Review>Yearning for an exciting African adventure? "Oka!" isn't it.</Review>
            <Review>What's refreshing about Oka! is its aversion to any kind of cliches.</Review>
            <Review>If only for its portrait of a land and a fascinating culture, "Oka!" is worth the journey.</Review>
            <Review>Despite some missteps and awkwardness, Oka! proves compelling and engaging. Currier captures the beauty of the African landscape, and she takes the time to document the Bayaka culture with care and compassion.</Review>
            <Review>A unique and fascinating tale of cultural connection, and the elemental nature of various human curiosities that bind us together.</Review>
            <Review>Slow to start and rambling when it gets going, Oka! nevertheless offers small pleasures, not least a glimpse of life deep in the African rainforest.</Review>
            <Review>OKA!, like the mysterious horn the characters hunt, is a real find.</Review>
            <Review>The film somehow feels more fanciful than factual, a rift that's aggravated by the juxtaposition of the real actors' performances and the Bayaka pygmies' at times startling real presence.</Review>
            <Review>Rather than idealize life in a state of nature, Oka! depicts Bayaka culture as messy and not always admirable, but exuberantly vital.</Review>

            <Review>This is a universal X-ray of bourgeois love, one that in a few decades will get around to something like Amour.</Review>
            <Review>Hawke and Delpy remain as charming as ever, and their combined goofiness is more endearing than annoying.</Review>
            <Review>Love is messy here, life cannot be controlled, satisfaction is far from guaranteed. Romance is rocky at best. But romance still is.</Review>
            <Review>Though "Before Midnight" is often uncomfortable to watch, it's never less than mesmerizing - and ultimately, a joy to walk with this prickly but fascinating couple again.</Review>
            <Review>"Before Midnight" is heartbreaking, but not because of Jesse and Celine. It's the filmmakers' passions that seem to have cooled.</Review>
            <Review>Before Midnight is fascinating to watch, and so long as Celine and Jesse are communicating, there's still hope.</Review>
            <Review>'Before Midnight' has all the best qualities of 'Sunrise' and 'Sunset' (a love of conversational dialogue, long takes that value the joy of performance and interaction, gorgeous European locations), yet it is a grander and more complicated achievement.</Review>
            <Review>The Greek ruins, once the perfect backdrop for ancient tragedies, now complement the Bergman-esque domestic discord and disillusionment that are about to unfurl.</Review>
            <Review>Everything about Before Midnight rings wonderfully and achingly true.</Review>
            <Review>Hawke and Delpy, who co-wrote the screenplay with Linklater, make this oscillation between badinage and feistiness, cosiness and irritability, look effortless.</Review>
            <Review>The chemistry is so good it is pratically tactile and their conversations, in the natural way of long-term couples, are free-ranging and show how at times of high emotion, arguments and resentment can resurface suddenly to powerful effect.</Review>
            <Review>The previous two pictures were preoccupied with romantic ideals, but this is the real love story. So funny and so wise, it's about how happily ever after is harder than it looks.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>98</Duration>
        <StoryLine>In Far Out, we meet an artist who creates boundary-exploring erotica and provocative political art, while penning best-selling children's literature with mischievous wit and childlike innocence. He arrives on American shores eager for economic opportunities and new creative freedom, and he leaves having offended even the tolerant and open-minded as he pushes past the limits of propriety. He becomes a broadly appealing artist and Madison Avenue success story, a singular artist steeped in piquant ideas and thoughts, yet even his most recognized books are now out of print. While Ungerer is by no means a victim, he is an early casualty of the so-called cultural wars-a man who didn't fit neatly into the left or the right, and who managed to offend and fascinate people of all political and cultural persuasions. Once the most famous children's book author in America, Tomi Ungerer became persona non grata in this country, exiled to the professional abyss, never to be heard from again.

            <Review>In 1958, Ungerer's picture book "Crictor" featured an unlikely hero, a boa constrictor, and the usual anodyne pabulum served up to bored kids would no longer do.</Review>
            <Review>As provocative as the art is - whether G-rated or R - the artist is even more interesting. Still sketching, still engaged, and, as the film closes, still searching for the outer reaches of enough.</Review>
            <Review>Ungerer's ice-blue eyes, sharp tongue and palpable enjoyment in shocking the bourgeoisie make him an engaging narrator.</Review>

            <Review>Bleak and beautiful, harrowing yet inspiring, "The Wall" ("Die Wand") is a stunning tale of isolation and survival in a wild and silent world.</Review>
            <Review>An elegant, slow-burning exercise in narrative minimalism.</Review>
            <Review>Pölsler's film is quietly deliberate without ever feeling slow, thanks to a few handy assets at his disposal.</Review>
            <Review>It's a shudder-inducing original.</Review>
            <Review>This mesmerising, austere and contemplative film provides a rarefied yet utterly immersive viewing experience.</Review>
            <Review>A remarkably involving film, especially given its brave, self-imposed limitations.</Review>
            <Review>The widescreen images of the Austrian landscape and the lovingly lit cabin interiors are unfailingly gorgeous, but Gedeck's the key asset: her fine, expressive features do almost as daunting a job as the words, words, words we hear.</Review>
            <Review>A heart-affecting tale of survival with a fierce and tender performance by Martina Gedeck.</Review>
            <Review>The Wall is nothing if not a mystery. Surely the premise would propel such a story into the realm of sci-fi and fantasy, but Pölsler and Gedeck never approach the story in this way, nor do they give us any easy answers to what has really happened and why.</Review>
            <Review>Has any movie ever had so much gab on the soundtrack? Every confession, every philosophical tidbit of the movie's tormented female protagonist.</Review>
            <Review>If you surrender to the style and premise, it's a rich and immensely rewarding film that begs repeat viewing.</Review>
            <Review>The sheer quantity of voiceover - or, more likely, subtitles - acts as a barrier to deep psychological immersion.</Review>

            <Review>It's a vivid portrait of the crisis in health care policy, with the caregivers and clinic itself as much on life support as the sick people.</Review>
            <Review>A moving portrait of people doing their jobs under very difficult circumstances - and, in virtually every moment we see, doing them with efficiency, wisdom and compassion.</Review>
            <Review>Nicks nets moments that are at turns horrific and touching, redemptive of those seeking treatment and the workers who provide it where no one else will.</Review>
            <Review>The level of frankness and vulnerability of those featured suggests just how compassionate a filmmaker Nicks (who acted as his own cinematographer) must be.</Review>
            <Review>Both a depressing indictment of a system that prioritizes health care based on insurance coverage and, at the same time, uplifting, if only because of the extraordinary professionals who keep it going - barely.</Review>
            <Review>Eloquently portrays the faults and limitations of the American health care system, even as it punctures some of the most toxic stereotypes surrounding it.</Review>
            <Review>In a year of exceptionally strong documentaries, The Waiting Room is one of the most urgent and effective.</Review>
            <Review>If you want to understand how the American system of health care delivery works for people without employer-sponsored health insurance, I can think of no better introduction than watching Peter Nicks' documentary The Waiting Room.</Review>
            <Review>A dramatic and inspiring look at a piece of the U.S. health care problem.</Review>
            <Review>Grim but enlightening, perhaps required viewing for those who care to debate themselves blue about a crisis they'll never fully understand.</Review>
            <Review>One of 2012's better documentaries... the gut-punch effectiveness of Peter Nicks' film lies in its forthrightness, and how it avoids speechifying.</Review>

Through the decades, they stayed bonded by family ties. Dark married an older woman named Scarlett and Shepard married her daughter. For years, the two couples lived together, until Shepard broke away for a relationship with Jessica Lange in 1983, leaving Johnny to help father his first son. Nevertheless, he and Dark continued writing to each other, amassing hundreds of letters. (c) Music Box</StoryLine>

            <Review>Both good times and bad bubble back up to the surface, giving the film an unguarded honesty.</Review>

            <Review>There's much to savor in Wurmfeld's insightful and oft-melancholy film about two old friends who've maintained said friendship since 1963.</Review>
            <Review>Instead, after all that effort being put into showing this relationship in its fullest terms, they allow the men to, true to their mythic southwestern surroundings, simply walk into the sunset...</Review>

            <Review>An ode to a long-lost era of bohemia, an insightful look into male psychology and pathology, a valentine to the art of letter writing and an illustration of how the past is never dead, because it's not even past.</Review>

            <Review>This coming-of-age drama might trade in familiar narrative developments, but its characterization is rather nuanced.</Review>
            <Review>Simplistic plotting, pedestrian visuals and poorly-handled melodrama do lend the project a cheap, made-for-TV feel, which is underscored by the fact that Danes and Marsden don't seem obliged to turn in their best work.</Review>
            <Review>Oh no: Claire Danes as the mom? Already? What's next, Chelsea Clinton for president?</Review>
            <Review>It is as if chunks of the film had landed on the editing-room floor in a desperate, last-minute attempt to trim its length. Just when its parts should come together, "As Cool as I Am" crumbles to bits.</Review>
            <Review>Mayer doesn't find a way to make the ritual traumas of adolescence feel new again.</Review>
            <Review>The familiarity of the narrative - the movie does, after all, include such coming-of-age touchstones as first love and irresponsible parents - grows more and more problematic as time progresses...</Review>
            <Review>The film is the cinematic equivalent of a teenager, making everything more melodramatic than it needs to be, and impatient with the subtle details of life.</Review>

        <StoryLine>In "PARADISE: Faith" Ulrich Seidl explores what it means to bear the cross. For Anna Maria, an X-ray technician, paradise lies with Jesus. She devotes her vacation to missionary work, so that Austria may be brought back to the path of virtue. On her daily pilgrimage through Vienna, she goes from door to door, carrying a foot-high statue of the Virgin Mary. One day, after years of absence, her husband, an Egyptian Muslim confined to a wheelchair, comes home. Hymns and prayers are now joined by fighting. "PARADISE: Faith" recounts the stations of the cross of a marriage and the longing for love.</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>The irrepressible Jessie Matthews heads the cast of the buoyant musical Sailing Along. Matthews plays Kay Martin, a popular British music-hall performer. At the height of her stardom, Kay gives it all up for the love of handsome Steve Barnes (Barry McKay). But before she makes this momentous decision, the audience is treated to three lively tunes: "My River", "Your Heart Skips a Beat" and "Trusting My Luck". Sailing Along was directed by Sonnie Hale, who from 1931 to 1944 was the husband of star Matthews; the film was also the last of the Hale-Matthews collaborations under the Gaumont-British banner. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>Remember the old saying "That's so crazy it might just work"? Two guys bet their futures on a notion that clich� seems to have been created to describe in this comedy-drama from director Jeffrey Balsmeyer. Matt (Dallas Roberts) and Sam (Jeremy Renner) are a pair of dreamers living in Tucson, Arizona who have a strong imaginative streak and a notion that they're going to strike it rich some day by inventing a gadget that will take the world by storm. Unfortunately, they lack both luck and business savvy; when Matt and Sam come up with a salable idea for a dog watch, it gets swiped from under them by Newkin (Richard Kind), a salesman who is seriously short on scruples, and it's only the latest in a long series of schemes that have gone wrong for them. Matt's wife Gina (Ayelet Zurer) has decided she's had enough, and he and Sam are looking bankruptcy in the eye when Matt hatches one last brainstorm he's convinced has promise. But who's really going to buy a talking beer opener? Also starring Eddie Jemison and Marguerite Moreau, Lightbulb was written and produced by Mike Cram, who based the story on his own experiences as one of the inventors of the talking bottle opener. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>Stanless Steel-"The Strongest Man in the World at Bending Steel and Metal"-is the only man alive capable of bending a U.S. penny with his fingers. But the world around Stan-his aging parents, his alcoholic brother, his beautiful but timid announcer-girlfriend, his show-biz agents and strength rivals, and even Stan himself-is not so malleable. As the pressure mounts, what starts as a unique portrait of a loveable outsider soon becomes a deeply universal, funny, and poignant story about trying to find a path to a better life through the scraps and dented dreams of our modern times.

            <Review>Plush is all over the map, but when its characters prattle on about how important their art is amidst all that terrible pose-heavy music, its really insufferable.</Review>
            <Review>Plush feels too familiar to leave any sort of impression. It throws together a cast that is mostly full of actors from similar genres, but even then Plush seems like a rehash of everything each actor did previously.</Review>
            <Review>Plush is a twisted tale of obsession, and the great performances from the entire cast make for a delightfully dark movie.</Review>
            <Review>Plush is just a B-movie B-side that few will take note of, a modern riff on Fatal Attraction that shoots for edgy, and lands on silly.</Review>
            <Review>Doesn't have a single interesting idea to share, wallowing in excess and stupidity, paying more attention to the thickness of eyeliner than the complexity of its mystery.</Review>

            <Review>Director Paul Feig, whose Bridesmaids upended notions of what a raunchy ensemble comedy could be, does it again here with another genre.</Review>
            <Review>If you've never seen the point of Sandra Bullock, watch this.</Review>
            <Review>There are only two reasons to see The Heat. But they are formidable reasons, and they go by the names of Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy.</Review>
            <Review>Yes, it's a cop-buddy film, and of course there is a case to be solved. But nobody cares about the familiarity of the premise. You get the sense that Paul Feig doesn't care either.</Review>
            <Review>If you've never seen Sandra Bullock blow a peanut shell out of her nose, and you'd like to, The Heat is your movie.</Review>
            <Review>In the cinematic world of worthwhile cop partnerships, The Heat is just an addled rookie.</Review>
            <Review>Bawdy, R-rated, the racial jokes run rampant: the sight-gag of a female cop stopping a perp with a hurled watermelon is just all kinds of funny. It oughta be a new franchise.</Review>
            <Review>It takes a special kind of film to evoke uproarious laughter from the sight of Sandra Bullock being repeatedly stabbed in the leg, but "The Heat" does exactly that.</Review>
            <Review>Ms. Bullock as the aggressive brute and Ms. McCarthy as the straitlaced go-getter would have challenged these easy stereotypes and made them a tad less insulting to successful career women everywhere.</Review>
            <Review>For the first half hour I thought it was gearing up to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen, but eventually it grew on me.</Review>
            <Review>Has good momentum and it's not actively unpleasant to look at, which sets it well on the right side of the bell curve of modern American comedy.</Review>

            <Review>"Jug Face" is not uniformly polished, yet it's a breakthrough, not so much for gore, or terror, but because the director can truly do tension, maybe a harder trick to pull off.</Review>
            <Review>This morbid, cruel movie seems leached of all things that might inadvertently give viewers pleasure.</Review>
            <Review>Some low-budget manifestations of the supernatural jazz up the frights now and again, but as the novelty of worshiping a hole in the ground fades, the film paints itself into a corner.</Review>
            <Review>Creepy atmospherics enliven this idiosyncratic chiller.</Review>
            <Review>An impressively oozing slab of indie horror that bodes well for first-time writer-director Chad Crawford Kinkle.</Review>
            <Review>Kinkle shows welcome restraint in pacing his grimy little tale, even if the sum of its parts never quite feels like more than an admirably rendered campfire yarn.</Review>
            <Review>Has a chilling atmosphere.</Review>
            <Review>A bizarre but consistently creepy tale of bad religion, bad spirits, and very bad behavior.</Review>
            <Review>Jug Face is part supernatural horror and part nutso cult escape flick, but it never fully commits to either.</Review>
            <Review>Jug Face becomes incredibly more terrifying once the themes of death are allowed to sink in, lingering in your mind hours after Kinkle's movie ends.</Review>
            <Review>A rising tide of dread and desperation marks Jug Face, a low-budget, independent slice of Southern Gothic characterized by a solid technical package.</Review>
            <Review>Chad Crawford Kinkle impressively imbues this supernatural world of backwoods mysticism with a plausible milieu while still staying committed to the film's own brewing insanity.</Review>

            <Review>Kevin Hart's (Along Came Polly) audience loves him, but if you're not in love yet, this probably won't start the infatuation for you.</Review>
            <Review>Once Hart finally gets onstage his act can barely live up to the hype.</Review>
            <Review>Kevin Hart is indeed a talented comedian. This is just not his best material.</Review>
            <Review>Any comic who can play the Garden must be good, but you wouldn't know it from this jumble of random routines and on-the-bus footage.</Review>
            <Review>He is, maybe, a little too frenetic, too frequently at full speed. But when he gets rolling, the laugh lines come quick, one after the other, and he kills.</Review>
            <Review>He tells elliptical stories that go on so long and take so many weird detours that they end up being funny even when they shouldn't be.</Review>
            <Review>Hart is a great comic - there is no doubt about that - but Let Me Explain reaches a kind of tipping point.</Review>
            <Review>I had a great night out. Unfortunately, I know Kevin Hart can do better.</Review>
            <Review>The laughs are frequent, with Hart's energy and timing having grown and been honed to more than fill the vast, cavernous space of Madison Square Garden.</Review>
            <Review>I'd rather attend a Norman Wisdom tribute concert in downtown Tirana than see this film again.</Review>
            <Review>I could have done without [the] pointless framing device, but there is some funny and highly incorrect material here.</Review>
            <Review>The less said about the specifics of the act the better -- wouldn't want to spoil the punchlines -- but Let Me Explain is a notch above Hart's last concert film, 2011's Laugh at My Pain.</Review>

            <Review>[A] gripping investigative doc, which plays out like a classic conspiracy thriller as it follows a trail of clues to the heart of darkness.</Review>
            <Review>It makes you wonder - what don't we know?</Review>
            <Review>By emphasizing the human cost of the operation, Scahill and Rowling turn "blowback" into much more than an abstract military-political term.</Review>
            <Review>These wars being fought in our name may be dirty, but this courageous film reminds us that as long as we have a free press, they don't have to be secret.</Review>
            <Review>Dirty Wars is essential viewing for all Americans, conservatives and liberals alike. It's intense and depressing. It'll make you angry.</Review>
            <Review>Scahill is as much a liability onscreen as he is a fascinating source.</Review>
            <Review>You become uncomfortably aware of scene-staging. How much re-enacting have we got going on here?... Once you become aware of it, this creeping subversion tends to gnaw away at the rest of the film.</Review>
            <Review>Dirty Wars is frightening and it's not over.</Review>
            <Review>Dirty Wars is challenging in a way few films are.</Review>
            <Review>This documentary is at least in theory non-political and not intended as overview of the past thirteen years. Instead, the filmmakers insist, it captures a moment in time on a downward spiral.</Review>
            <Review>An infuriating and depressing look at how American foreign policy and warfare have been transformed in highly undemocratic ways, and a reminder of what real journalism looks like.</Review>
            <Review>"Dirty Wars" may lack the nuance and design of an Errol Morris documentary, but it is nonetheless the most important and searing documentary of 2013. See it. Talk about it.</Review>

            <Review>A high-seas hostage-taking and resulting negotiations are absorbingly dramatized in this low-key Venice standout from Denmark's hottest new writer-director.</Review>
            <Review>A nail-biter of a thriller that eschews conventional thrills, Tobias Lindholm's verité-like tale of a Danish cargo ship hijacked by Somali pirates is rivetingly low-key.</Review>
            <Review>A finely spun tale that eschews sensationalism to focus on the human toll on the captives, their families and their employers back home.</Review>
            <Review>This isn't an action picture; it's a picture about the suspense and terror of inaction.</Review>
            <Review>It aims to not allow you to leave the theater without empathizing with victims of such real-life violence. And that's what makes the film so memorable - and haunting.</Review>
            <Review>Captain Phillips revisited. How do you say 'I'm the captain now!' in Danish?</Review>
            <Review>Besides the subject matter, the parallels between Lindholm's sensitive, slow-moving A Hijacking and Paul Greengrass' relentless Captain Phillips are few and far between.</Review>
            <Review>Lindholm's insistence on a lived-in realism paid off.</Review>
            <Review>A Hijacking refrains from exploiting or judging the situation, which reminds us that all of the characters think their behavior is justified. Whether any of them is right is left to us to decide.</Review>
            <Review>A Hijacking achieves considerable power by avoiding the obvious, and staying close to its characters.</Review>

            <Review>This sci-fi thriller makes us almost feel the frosty cold in our bones, thanks to cinematographer Pierce Gill's magic touch.</Review>
            <Review>It's got a lot going for it, especially the terrific cast, but in the end it's nothing more than a glossy cinematic shrug.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>Del Toro is a dreamer. He's a visionary. If you give him a pile of money to make enormous robots fight enormous monsters at the end of civilization, he will work to make Pacific Rim a movie that makes you feel all the enormousness.</Review>
            <Review>It is possible to applaud Pacific Rim for the efficacy of its business model while deploring the tale that has been engendered -- long, loud, dark, and very wet. You might as well watch the birth of an elephant.</Review>
            <Review>A ridiculously entertaining (and often just plain ridiculous) monster-robot movie that plays like that "Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots" game from the 1960s.</Review>
            <Review>Its visual achievements notwithstanding, Pacific Rim's greatest breakthrough may be that it's the first Hollywood blockbuster to sport a title less descriptive of its plot than of its intended market.</Review>
            <Review>It's as if Del Toro neuro-linked with a robot and then couldn't figure out how to work the controls -- and so watched impotently as the machine made the major creative decisions.</Review>
            <Review>All the unpredictability of professional wrestling plus the magic of synchronized Stairmasters -- that's what I got out of the vaunted spectacle of Pacific Rim.</Review>
            <Review>Pacific Rim may work best in its smaller moments, a testament to director Guillermo del Toro's ability to build worlds.</Review>
            <Review>I expected the melding of horror and humor so singular to him, not the soulless and ultimately monotonous spectacle actually delivered.</Review>
            <Review>Mythology is rife with giants. There are Greek Titans, Norse Jotuns, a race of giant humans that went extinct, Cyclops, Bigfoot-which giant mythology does 'Pacific Rim' tap?</Review>
            <Review>Pacific Rim is the most shamelessly entertaining summer movie we've seen so far this year.</Review>
            <Review>"Pacific Rim" puts the "disaster" in "disaster movie."</Review>
            <Review>It's brilliant. I couldn't keep the smile off my face the whole way home.</Review>

        <StoryLine>An odd-jobs man is down to list last few pennies when he's drawn into a increasingly complicated web of crime in this comedy from Chinese filmmaker Mi Lawen. Liu Yuejin (Li Yixiang) is a traveling laborer from Henan who has made his way to Beijing looking for work. Yan (Liu Xinyi), a corrupt real estate baron, gives Liu a job cooking lunch at one of hi job sites, but he's still just keeping his head above water when his bag is stolen after work. Not only did Liu's bag contain all his cash, but it had an IOU from a petty crook who promised Liu 60,000 yuan as a consolation after he ran off with Liu's wife several years before. Liu needs the money soon, especially now that his grown-up son (Zhang Zhiwei) is trying to start a business, but his search for the thief takes an unexpected turn when it turns out Yan and his cronies are looking for the same man. It seems the crook has come into possession of a computer memory stick that has some data which could ruin Yan's life and career if it fell into the wrong hands. Wo Jiao Liu Yuejin (aka Lost and Found) received its North American premiere at the 2008 Montreal World Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <Duration>83</Duration>
        <StoryLine>A new space race is born between NASA and the ESA when Charlie Brownsville, Hank Morrison, and Dr. Casey Cook compete against an artificially intelligent robot to find out what's up there on the red planet. 'Mars' follows these three astronauts on the first manned mission to our galactic neighbor. On the way they experience life threatening accidents, self doubts, obnoxious reporters, and the boredom of extended space travel. This romantic comedy is told in the playful style of a graphic novel- using a unique animation process that director Geoff Marslett developed specifically for the film. Underneath the silliness Mars is also an exploration of exploration. Why do we want to know what is out there? How do we react to what we find? Is it really that important? And where does love fit into the whole thing? While our brave astronauts are out there taming the new frontier, their voyage is reflected, and sometimes distorted, through the eyes of the reporters, scientists, and politicians back home. Once they reach the 'new world' life and love flourish in the most unexpected places. --&amp;copy; Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>A surprisingly thoughtful, well-researched attempt to give both sides of the argument respect while illuminating the long history of tensions surrounding gun ownership in America.</Review>
            <Review>The documentary is predictable, stylistically stolid and about as focused as a pellet-gun blast.</Review>
            <Review>While the film leans more heavily toward pro-gun ownership, finessing that position with a nod toward left-leaning politics, its real purpose is to bring some historical perspective to the argument, to move the conversation beyond emotion-based rhetoric.</Review>
            <Review>The almost-complete absence of dissenting voices will likely limit its audience to gun-toting members of the choir, though anyone with an interest in the subject would be well-served by hearing its arguments.</Review>

            <Review>A film bloated by excess material.</Review>
            <Review>The effort to pack an already overstuffed picaresque epic into a film of more than two hours ends up an indigestible stew.</Review>
            <Review>The film is beautifully shot, with vivid production design. But because of the tale's lack of cohesion, it doesn't carry enough emotional heft.</Review>
            <Review>Faithfully adapted from Salman Rushdie's award-winning 1981 novel, the movie feels both too packed and too slight, overflowing with vivid details but lacking the structure to support their weight.</Review>
            <Review>There are enough intermittent passages of power and beauty to get you through the slow spots.</Review>
            <Review>A pretty but staidly linear epic drained of the novel's larkish, metaphorical sweep, and a collection of multi-generational love stories lacking their originally eccentric, fizzy charm.</Review>
            <Review>There's nothing to hang onto here. Most scenes last only two or three minutes, and events don't accrue so much as they just pig-pile on top of one another.</Review>
            <Review>Amidst all the exuberance on screen, a major literary work has been given a new and accessible form of life.</Review>
            <Review>A miniseries might have been able to knock this story out of the park, but the movie is a solid double.</Review>
            <Review>Rushdie's script is faithful to his source novel to a fault. The lesson is that writers revisiting their work for another medium sometimes can't see the story for the words...</Review>
            <Review>A highly eventful, allegorical portrait of the contentious dual nature of the Indian subcontinent.</Review>
            <Review>Teeming with personality and digestible flights of fancy, only to be crushed by the overall narrative responsibility, unable to juggle faces and places to satisfaction.</Review>

        <Duration>100</Duration>

            <Review>As drama, After Earth offers no surprises; as action, it's rarely stimulating; as a parenting manual, it seems that Will has thrown Jaden into water that's a little too deep.</Review>
            <Review>Most disappointing is the film's lack of ambition, as what could have been a sparky mainstream space opera becomes just another tedious jungle chase movie.</Review>
            <Review>The movie takes off from a concept as basic as a videogame, and it sticks to that concept, without surprise.</Review>
            <Review>A film in which the text and subtext-an effortlessly gifted father presses his less-talented son to follow in his footsteps-are in perfect alignment. Alas, only in one of the two does the story end happily.</Review>
            <Review>By the standards of M. Night's Shyamalan's recent films, After Earth is surprisingly not horrible.</Review>
            <Review>It's no classic, but it's a special movie: spectacular and wise.</Review>
            <Review>Like 'Oblivion' before it 'After' says, 'Humans messed up,' but offers meager entertainment, nothing in terms of solutions, and lots of intelligence-insulting pseudo-science.</Review>
            <Review>If [Jaden Smith] wants a career in film, he'll need to do better than this.</Review>
            <Review>It's not Shyamalan's fault -- he did his best with what he was given. He deserves another shot.</Review>
            <Review>After Earth unfortunately still finds M. Night Shyamalan plodding through another dull, lifeless movie.</Review>
            <Review>After a not very impressive crash sequence, the film settles into a running battle between young Master Smith and a series of CGI monsters, a schema that sounds tiresome, and is.</Review>
            <Review>The dialogue is as wooden as the acting, and the plot is just silly. Truly, the only thing the film has going for it are some occasionally cool special effects.</Review>

            <Review>[Blu-ray Review] One of those movies where none of the pieces quite fit when the viewer thinks back on them, "Static" takes a crafty idea, but debuting director-cowriter Todd Levin doesn't always play fair with the audience.</Review>
            <Review>A weak thriller that takes a fairly interesting premise and throws it away to play a cheap game of cat-and-mouse.</Review>

            <Review>Frankly, the guy just isn't very interesting.</Review>
            <Review>Groovy period soundtrack aside, "The Look of Love" has almost nothing to say of any interest, importance or humor.</Review>
            <Review>Double-billing comic and tragic tones, the biopic "The Look of Love" follows a father and a daughter over three decades in London's swinging Soho.</Review>
            <Review>Director Michael Winterbottom and screenwriter Matt Greenhalgh provide the essential outline of Raymond's story, but they're a little too preoccupied with its glitzy aspects.</Review>
            <Review>A puzzlingly misconceived biopic: a tasteful, subdued movie about a man who was as tasteless and unsubdued as they come.</Review>
            <Review>Coogan turns in a fine dramatic performance in a role that calls for as much actual acting as wisecracking.</Review>
            <Review>Coogan's own impersonation is precise, but the melancholy that finally engulfs Raymond is beyond him.</Review>
            <Review>The Look of Love comes off as an extremely standard biopic that seems to have emerged directly from a template for such films...</Review>
            <Review>Steve Coogan's fourth collaboration with director Michael Winterbottom is a funny, visually inventive take on Britain's Hugh Hefner.</Review>
            <Review>Coogan is adept at playing the cad, but Winterbottom gives him little else to do.</Review>
            <Review>Coogan never comes close to disappearing into the character, leaving the whole movie teetering uneasily between campy naughtiness and empathetic character study.</Review>
            <Review>It's a case of "fourth time unlucky" for frequent collaborators Michael Winterbottom and Steve Coogan. Well, "uninspired" might be more accurate.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Alex, twenty seven, lives in a working-class Paris neighborhood and sells drugs for a living, continuously paying off the debts of his brother Isaac (played by French auteur Cedric Kahn), who's becoming a real burden. When his cousin, who has just returned from completing his military service in Israel, tells him he's opening a restaurant in Tel Aviv, Alex thinks that joining him might be the life-changing opportunity he was waiting for. But in order to leave, Alex must quickly find enough money and accomplish his "aliyah" (the term for Jews emigrating to Israel) which involves, among other things, Hebrew lessons and connecting with his Jewish roots. He also has to leave behind his beloved city of Paris, his former lover Esther, his lifelong friend Mathias, and Jeanne, a woman whom he's just met but has the potential of becoming someone important in his life. Torn between making his aliyah, his drug selling, his complicated love life and a destructive brother, Alex will have to find his own way and make a final decision. (c) Film Movement</StoryLine>

            <Review>Wajeman introduces some unexpected elements, which he handles with surprising dexterity considering this is his feature debut.</Review>
            <Review>A marvelous film, stripped of false urgency.</Review>

            <Review>Refreshing portrait, mostly free of idealism, religion, and stereotypes, of how a troubled, secular young Parisian struggles. . .to change his life. . . [but] seems passive.</Review>

            <Review>Much Ado About Nothing is a delightfully spirited romp, filled with visual splendor, strong performances and flashes of post-modern absurdity.</Review>
            <Review>The movie swings along, with a grace denied to some of Whedon's grander projects ...</Review>
            <Review>The magic holds. It holds from beginning to end.</Review>
            <Review>This fast and loose independent production is enjoyable as a home movie, but not much more.</Review>
            <Review>A delightful mix of the modern and the Elizabethan, a sort of do-it-yourself re-imagination of a true comic classic.</Review>
            <Review>There's no fire, and where their lines should ricochet with wit, they just spill forth, affably.</Review>
            <Review>Loose, enjoyable, and sparkling, it's a movie that lives for the sound of clinking wine glasses and snappy patter.</Review>
            <Review>It's a private party, for Whedon fans only.</Review>
            <Review>This new adaptation of the Shakespearean play is very odd looking, like a modern film done on the cheap, in an ancient language, viewed on a 60-year-old television set.</Review>
            <Review>The wine flows freely throughout the film, and likely, all through production too.</Review>
            <Review>But it is the dark side of Much Ado-everything associated with the smearing of Hero's reputation and her lover Claudio's savage rejection of her-that emerges most forcefully here</Review>
            <Review>More familiar than fresh, but no less amusing. Whedon uses Shakespeare to remind audiences that the problems that existed in the seventeenth century remain relevant and embedded in the human heart.</Review>

            <Review>"The Lifeguard" is hemmed in by vagueness and cliche, and nearly ruined by its soundtrack, an insistent barrage of thematically obvious alt-radio music cues.</Review>
            <Review>Although writer-director Liz W. Garcia's wistful, angsty tale treads familiar ground, the filmmaker has crafted a credibly flawed and conflicted heroine who holds interest.</Review>
            <Review>The central character simply comes across as whiny and entitled instead of troubled and dark, and the central theme of getting your groove back by acting like a kid again has been done many times by much more talented filmmakers.</Review>
            <Review>The movie really depends on Bell, and her story, and neither is interesting or compelling enough to engage us.</Review>
            <Review>This directorial debut by Liz W. Garcia, a writer for television, bears some echoes of its creator's origins, going from deft to trite in its drama and setting up character arcs that feel sappily resolved within its feature length.</Review>
            <Review>The movie's being billed in some quarters as a comedy, which is a hell of a stretch given that the plot expands to take in statutory rape and teen suicide.</Review>
            <Review>Drama is short on story, long on illicit romance.</Review>

            <Review>The story, while unsurprising, is also quietly satisfying. Everyone comes to accept some hard truths about themselves.</Review>
            <Review>Cliched literary trappings come together in "Stuck in Love," but the final product feels more like a footnote than a finished work.</Review>
            <Review>Although "Stuck in Love" is an indie film, it hews slavishly to Hollywood formulas right down to its comfy Thanksgiving Day ending. It's all so easy, isn't it?</Review>
            <Review>Just like most romantic comedies (though this is more of a "rom-dram"), Stuck In Love. believes nothing is worthier than refusing to give up after you've been rebuffed in no uncertain terms.</Review>

            <Review>[VIDEO ESSAY] A well blended cocktail of familial connections, aspirations, and separations, "Stuck in Love" is a complex romantic comedy that keeps on giving even when you think it has run its course.</Review>

When a job goes very wrong and Lucky finds himself in debt to local heavies, Sebastian (Craig Fairbrass) and Mr. Kramer (Terry Stone), Lucky is forced to join his wayward brother on the biggest heist of their careers. While Raphael concocts a plan to rob the casino of the most powerful crime-lord in town, Mr. Zigic (James Cosmo), and with the help of Zigic's own unwitting employees Niko (Marak Ovarek) and Eli (Jason Maza), Lucky is distracted by the girl of his dreams, femme fatale Bridgett (Emily Atack), who may not be all that she seems. With betrayals and twists of fate, it seems everyone has an ulterior motive - the question is, who can the brothers trust on the most important night of their lives?</StoryLine>

            <Review>Radical experiential/experimental video of bloody viscera and abstract beauty. Embedded/embodied lens as in Brakhage's "The Governor" and Geyrhalter's "Our Daily Bread."</Review>

            <Review>Edited together into a non-linear and virtually wordless whole, it creates a briny immersive effect that is almost hallucinatory.</Review>
            <Review>It may cause impatience with many viewers, but for others it can be a meditative and revelatory experience.</Review>
            <Review>No interviews or narration are needed and none is offered, leaving the audience all at sea, adrift on the strange tide of sound and vision.</Review>

            <Review>"Resolution" is a notch above your average low-budget horror flick. It has the usual gore and scares and head-scratching events. But, the story is what locked me in.</Review>
            <Review>Honest about the impulses of addiction, but could stand to have its core interpersonal conflict sharpened up some without sacrificing any of its overall narrative ambiguity.</Review>
            <Review>One of the first things about Resolution that catches you off guard is the humor.</Review>
            <Review>As a meditation on horror films, and even film itself, Resolution might be in danger of coming across as pretentious, if it weren't so damned entertaining throughout.</Review>

            <Review>It's clear immediately that Curse of Chucky marks an effort to return to the more-horrific-than-comedic atmosphere of the series' first installment...</Review>
            <Review>There's something to be said for going back to old-school scares once the self-mocking silliness dries up.</Review>
            <Review>[It] isn't just the most atmospheric and scary Chucky film, it's one of the most confident and successful American horror movies of the 2010s.</Review>
            <Review>By grounding the film in a haunted house-style horror movie and making Chucky a creepy doll again, while still maintaining the warped humor that the first three films had, it may deliver the best film in the franchise.</Review>
            <Review>The Child's Play franchise...makes a surprising, successful reversal with Curse Of Chucky, the franchise's serious-minded, at times even dour fifth sequel.</Review>
            <Review>This could've been a lame trainwreck, and is instead a clear labor of love that re-grounds the series and sets it up gleefully for other sequels.</Review>
            <Review>Serves as a really good and entertaining book end for the end of the series...</Review>
            <Review>After nine years, Chucky is finally back in his proper element, and that's reason enough for any horror fan to rejoice.</Review>
            <Review>Curse Of Chucky is a vicious return to form for one of horror's most legendary icons, terrorizing victims in the purest, darkest form of criminal insanity.</Review>
            <Review>Despite the return of Brad Douriff as the voice of Chucky and writer-director Don Mancini, this installment lacks the humor or thrills of the films that went before.</Review>
            <Review>There's nothing here to indicate that the current iteration of Chucky contains enough life to stalk though anything more than a string of middling direct-to-video sequels.</Review>

            <Review>There is something refreshing in the decidedly downbeat "Europa Report," a science-fiction film with the emphasis on science that doesn't cheat on the tension.</Review>
            <Review>Low key and earnest, Sebastián Cordero's "Europa Report" makes compelling use of familiar genre material to create an intelligent science fiction thriller.</Review>
            <Review>There are scenes of unutterable beauty in Europa Report, a low-budget space exploration sci-fi suspenser from Ecuadorian director Sebastián Cordero.</Review>
            <Review>What isn't straightforward about the plot is either hackneyed, implausible, or both.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>100</Duration>
        <StoryLine>NOTHING LEFT TO FEAR was inspired by the legend of Stull, Kansas. Wendy (Anne Heche), her husband Dan (James Tupper of "Revenge") and their kids have just moved to the small town of Stull, Kansas, where Dan is the new pastor. But in this sleepy community of friendly neighbors, a horrific series of occurrences awaits them: Their teenage daughter (Rebekah Brandes of Bellflower) is being tormented by grisly visions. Her younger sister (Jennifer Stone of "Wizards Of Waverly Place") has been marked for a depraved ritual. And deep within the heartland darkness, one of The Seven Gates Of Hell demands the blood of the innocent to unleash the creatures of the damned. Ethan Peck ("10 Things I Hate About You") and Clancy Brown (The Shawshank Redemption) co-star in this demonic shocker featuring original music by producer SLASH and inspired by the real-life paranormal legacy of Stull. NOTHING LEFT TO FEAR was written by Jonathon W.C. Mills and directed by Anthony Leonardi III. (c) Official Facebook</StoryLine>

        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>77</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Bringing a feminine perspective to the debate that's currently raging across the nation, Cathryne Czubek's new feature documentary A GIRL AND A GUN reveals how women have embraced an object whose history is deeply bound to men and masculinity. Filmed throughout the U.S., the film delves deep into the psyche of the American gun world to show the complex relationship between American women and their guns. Penetrating far beyond Hollywood's hyper-sexualized femme fatales, A GIRL AND A GUN candidly explores the modern American woman through intimate portraits of several women that revolve around fundamental issues of preservation, power, feminism and violence. Punctuated with archival footage and expert commentary to provide a rich historical and cultural context, the film presents a complex and empowering perspective on a deadly serious issue. The intimate and graphic portrayals in A GIRL AND A GUN are of women who've carved themselves a place in the gun community, but their personal journeys in one way or another reflect the same issues every woman faces today. A GIRL AND A GUN will not end the nation's decisive battle over the legality or availability of guns, but it does give voice to those American women, young and old, who have been affected by firearms or believe in the right to responsibly and legally possess firearms.(c) First Run Features</StoryLine>

            <Review>Writer-director James DeMonaco's The Purge fritters away its promise in lurid, frenzied violence.</Review>
            <Review>DeMonaco clearly hopes to make a significant moral statement on the level of Shirley Jackson's literary masterpiece The Lottery. Alas, his aim at political conservatives who support the gun lobby falls flat before he can pull the trigger.</Review>
            <Review>If The Purge is as far-sighted as Network proved to be, we are in for very ugly times.</Review>
            <Review>That old horror-movie standard, a homestead besieged by psychos, gets remixed with a bit of Occupy-era class-conflict satire in the disappointing future-set thriller The Purge.</Review>
            <Review>Gimmicky chiller lacks the robustness and distinction needed to support its social-commentary ambitions.</Review>
            <Review>The blunt instrument plot allows for a few sneaky moments of satire and social commentary lite.</Review>
            <Review>The Purge offers mediocre thrills wrapped in absurd rhetoric.</Review>
            <Review>There are some jump scares, one highly predictable twist, and a fair amount of violence, but "The Purge" pretty much begins and ends with its concept.</Review>
            <Review>Nauseating.</Review>
            <Review>Standard "stalk, attack, revenge" home invasion material, but it's also laced with an appreciable sense of pointed social commentary.</Review>
            <Review>There might be true satire here, but it would take a far less bored reviewer than me to pick away at the flab surrounding the satire.</Review>
            <Review>An effective balance of mood and style, not overburdened by grotesque displays of violence but suggestive enough to create a space of believable bleakness that warrants our continued interest until the very last frame.</Review>

        <StoryLine>The made-for-television The Man in the Iron Mask was, at the very least, the twelfth film version of Alexandre Dumas' novel The Vicomte of Bragelonne: Ten Years Later - the second sequel to his Three Musketeers. The title character is Philippe (Richard Chamberlain), claimant to the throne of France. Supporters of Philippe's vile twin brother, King Louis XIV (also Chamberlain), kidnap Philippe, lock him in a dungeon, and obscure his identity with an iron mask. But aging D'Artagnan (Louis Jourdan), who'd virtually raised Philippe from boyhood, reunites his old musketeer cohorts to rescue Philippe, overthrow the wicked Louis, and place the "rightful heir" on the throne. Emmy nominations went to scripter William Bast and costumer Olga Lehmann. Photographed by the great Freddie Young, Man in the Iron Mask was first telecast January 17, 1977</StoryLine>

            <Review>Keaton's appreciation of the formal paradoxes of the medium is astounding; his observations on the relationship between film and the subconscious are groundbreaking and profound. And it's a laugh riot, too.</Review>
            <Review>Keaton's third feature under his own steam is an incredible technical accomplishment, but also an almost Pirandellian exploration of the nature of cinematic reality.</Review>
            <Review>A master of movement and stillness, Keaton developed a comedy style that was as intellectual as it was physical, and this small gem shows us why he's as purely American a film genius as the motion pictures have produced.</Review>
            <Review>The unexpected, fantastic dream situations lend themselves to some remarkable trick effects, including one in which Buster walks right out of an audience and into a picture on the screen.</Review>
            <Review>There is an extremely good comedy which will give you plenty of amusement, so long as you permit Mr. Keaton to glide into his work with his usual deliberation.</Review>
            <Review>This Buster Keaton feature length comedy is about as unfunny as a hospital operating room.</Review>
            <Review>Sherlock Jr. is Keaton's signature statement, and mind-warping flight of fancy on the dreamlike nature of films and the fluid nature of our ontological existence.</Review>
            <Review>One of Buster Keaton's finest comedies, certainly his most inventive and technically audacious.</Review>
            <Review>Buster Keaton's third and shortest feature ranks among his best.</Review>
            <Review>Not only one of the funniest movies of all time, filled with staggering stunts, amazing sight gags, and mind-boggling cinematic tricks, but it's also a brilliant meditation on the nature of the film medium itself, perhaps the best ever made.</Review>
            <Review>This is a dizzyingly inventive, postmodernist exercise in breaking down cinema's 'fourth wall', Keaton playing with the possibilities of the medium and cramming an unbelievable quantity of gags and ideas into the film.</Review>
            <Review>Sherlock Jr. is notable for a series of scintillating, near-inexplicable stunts, Keaton's characteristically dexterous and deadpan performance, as well as for its fat-free rattling-good storytelling and witty intertitles.</Review>

            <Review>Loose and ragtag, stirring and poignant, the documentary "Ain't in It for My Health: A Film About Levon Helm" proves a fitting tribute to its late star ...</Review>
            <Review>The portrait of the ailing artist is bittersweet, but when Helms sings or plays, the look on his face is pure joy.</Review>
            <Review>Less than satisfying treatment of beloved musician, who never quite lets his guard down.</Review>
            <Review>It's a sympathetic portrait of an artist whose heart lay more with new work than old glories, right up to the end.</Review>
            <Review>An affectionate tribute and a gift for fans who grew fond of his company on records or at concerts and who would like a little bit more.</Review>
            <Review>And of all the figures - Bob Dylan, Gram Parsons, et al. - who smuggled those sepia-toned seeds into rock 'n' roll, Helm, was arguably the most authentic.</Review>
            <Review>Heartfelt tribute to musician Levon Helm receives a theatrical release on the anniversary of his death in 2012.</Review>
            <Review>A portrait of a tough American musical spirit, fighting through until the end and taking energy and solace from the music he created.</Review>
            <Review>Director Jacob Hatley clearly earned the complete trust of Helm's inner circle, enough to capture the icon's crusty humor, singular talent and significant bravery in the face of his fate.</Review>
            <Review>Despite his flashes of bitterness, the Helm captured here seems like a man at peace with where he ended up - however taxing the road that brought him, however many friends lost or discarded along the way.</Review>
            <Review>An unsentimental, salt-of-the-earth tribute that keeps the beat in a way that would make this extraordinary journeyman beam.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>106</Duration>
        <StoryLine>HOLLYWOOD WOULD NEVER BE THE SAME. When Maila Nurmi took to the TV airwaves in 1954 as the original gothic scream queen VAMPIRA, a national craze was launched. Haughty, domineering, and an instant icon of female power and sexuality, VAMPIRA cast her spell over other rebels and rabbler-rousers of the day, including JAMES DEAN, MARLON BRANDO and ELVIS PRESLEY. But the woman behind the fa�ade was both far more intricate and much more fragile that the character that made her famous, and the price of momentary glory and cult superstardom was almost unbearably high. VAMPIRA AND ME is the epic and acclaimed new documentary VARIETY called "thoroughly engrossing" and which the AUSTIN CHRONICLE described as "devastating." INCLUDES HUNDREDS OF RARE AND UNSEEN STILLS, PHOTOS AND FILMS, including MAILA NURMI'S PRIVATE HOME MOVIES and TWO NEWLY DISCOVERED KINESCOPES OF "VAMPIRA" UNSEEN FOR SIX DECADES.

            <Review>A fine tribute to a ghoulish iconoclast</Review>
            <Review>Vampira and Me works on multiple levels: as a Hollywood history lesson, as a portrait of mid-fifties Americana, and as a long-overdue tribute to the endlessly fascinating Nurmi, whom Greene befriended during the autumn of her years.</Review>
            <Review>It will tell you a lot about Vampira from one point of view, and it is a nice tribute in that regard. But it is not a thorough journalistic study, and disappoints if one expects that.</Review>
            <Review>Vampira and Me winds up having much to say about stardom, friendships and betrayals along with delivering a slice of American pop cultural history.</Review>
            <Review>Nurmi is sympathetic, likeable, and quite intriguing; she is well worth spending an hour and half with.</Review>

            <Review>A psychological suspense film with an open ending that's more haunting than the tricky climaxes of most post-Hitchcock thrillers.</Review>
            <Review>A real-life cyber-thriller with real-life consequences, Alex Gibney's We Steal Secrets: The Story of WikiLeaks is a riveting and revelatory documentary ...</Review>
            <Review>Gibney builds a remarkable level of suspense, given how exhaustively WikiLeaks has been covered in the media.</Review>
            <Review>Engaging, kinetic, revelatory and unexpected.</Review>
            <Review>We Steal Secrets is more earnest than exciting.</Review>
            <Review>Gibney does a good job surveying the history of WikiLeaks, but unfortunately, there is little left to say.</Review>
            <Review>It isn't propaganda, it's journalism. This is a very controversial film among Assange's followers because it shows Assange to be less than the Messiah they think he is. This provides an exit from news echo chambers.</Review>

        <StoryLine>In MEA MAXIMA CULPA: SILENCE IN THE HOUSE OF GOD, Oscar (R)-winning filmmaker Alex Gibney examines the abuse of power in the Catholic Church through the story of four courageous deaf men, who in the first known case of public protest, set out to expose the priest who abused them. Through their case the film follows a cover-up that winds its way from the row houses of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, through the bare ruined choirs of Ireland's churches, all the way to the highest office of the Vatican.

            <Review>The case has been widely reported but this is still an important film, laying out who knew what, and when. It's chilling: the conspiracy of silence goes all the way to the Vatican.</Review>
            <Review>It feels a bit like a monster movie. It is, too.</Review>
            <Review>In the end, decades of such crimes going undetected and undeterred under the aegis of one employer - any employer - speaks for itself. And the extraordinary perseverance and courage of the men from St. John's speaks louder still.</Review>
            <Review>Partly an inspiring saga of growing "deaf power" and human resilience, and partly a murky and fragmentary drama about an immense, closed-minded bureaucracy with paranoid and conspiratorial tendencies that finds itself unable to adjust to the modern world.</Review>
            <Review>There is something to be said for a clear and unblinking recitation of facts, and thankfully Mr. Gibney does a lot of that.</Review>
            <Review>Gibney's most powerful film since the Oscar-winning 2007 Taxi to the Dark Side.</Review>
            <Review>a carefully constructed observation of the facts and a withering condemnation of the behaviour of the Catholic Church.</Review>
            <Review>Before you say you can't take another feature length documentary about sexual abuse committed by Catholic priests, know that Alex Gibney's examination of the subject is both fresh and revelatory.</Review>
            <Review>Gibney tracks a disgraceful cover-up within the Catholic church.</Review>
            <Review>A heartbreaking, brilliantly executed exposé, in which four deaf victims bring the church to account. Their testimonies are chilling.</Review>
            <Review>Alex Gibney isn't casting the first stone at the Vatican with his documentary Mea Maxima Culpa: Silence in the House of God. But, God willing, it will be the most effective in shattering their narrative of blissful ignorance.</Review>
            <Review>Tragedy that sticks to your bones -- a gut-punch look at the Catholic Church child sex abuse scandal as filtered through the experiential prism of a group of victims from a single Midwestern school for the deaf.</Review>

        <Title>I Married a Witch</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 1942</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>77</Duration>
        <StoryLine>As she burns at the stake, a 17th century witch, Jennifer (Veronica Lake), places a curse on her accuser (Fredric March), so that from this day forward, all of his descendants (each played by him) will be unhappy in marriage. After several hilarious through-the-years examples (the Civil War-era Fredric March runs off to battle rather than endure his wife's nagging), we are brought up to 1942. Wallace Wooley (March) is a gubernatorial candidate, preparing to wed snooty socialite Estelle Masterson (Susan Hayward) -- the well-to-do daughter of a publisher who is backing him. A bolt of lightning strikes the tree where Jennifer had been executed three centuries earlier, thereby freeing the spirits of Jennifer and her warlock father, Daniel (Cecil Kellaway). Wallace meets Jennifer when she materializes in a burning building, obliging him to save her life. The revivified sorceress does everything in her power to induce Wallace to fall in love with her -- even destroying the ceremony in which the wedding is supposed to take place. The attempts succeed, and the two marry, but on their wedding night, Wallace refuses to believe Jennifer's claims that she is a witch. Frustrated, she attempts to convince him by doctoring the gubernatorial election -- in his favor. Based on the Thorne Smith novel The Passionate Witch, the rollicking I Married a Witch can be considered the forerunner of the TV series Bewitched, but only on a surface level. The film had been scheduled to be directed by Preston Sturges and to be released by its producing studio, Paramount; the end result was helmed by Ren� Clair (his second Hollywood film), and was distributed by United Artists.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Carries some interest on the novelty angles, if nothing else, but on the whole is generally tepid.</Review>
            <Review>I Married A Witch is spiritualism in a vein of knockabout farce. It is more oh-boy than occult. But its humor is Clair enough.</Review>
            <Review>Lake is delightfully effective as the malicious woman, whose ideas of punishment are often beautifully absurd, and March provides an excellent foil.</Review>
            <Review>Fans of Veronica Lake won't be disappointed; the special effects are nicely done too.</Review>
            <Review>It may be not be one of the classic examples of a Hollywood screwball comedy -- might I recommend His Girl Friday to anyone interested? -- but I Married a Witch contains enough modest laughs to satisfy couch potatoes on a chilly fall evening.</Review>
            <Review>The movie's practical magic still looks perfectly groovy, and doesn't need any kind of digital re-imagining.</Review>
            <Review>The film is powered by swooning romanticism, impish wit, teasing sexuality, and an underlying sophistication.</Review>
            <Review>any rough spots are smoothed over by Lake and March's considerable charms, which turn out to be this fantastical comedy's best special effects</Review>

            <Review>The Croods isn't particularly smart, but it has just enough wit to keep us engaged and just enough speed to keep us from feeling restless.</Review>
            <Review>It captures the wonder (and more gently, the anxiety) of discovery time and time again. And the filmmakers have a hoot playing with the Croods' encounters with, as well as their misunderstandings of, all things new.</Review>
            <Review>As family viewing, it's pleasant enough: primitive, yes, but in a digitally sophisticated way that's boisterous, funny and will no doubt sell a lot of toys.</Review>
            <Review>The animation is first-rate, with moments of genuine visual imagination, and the story, while unremarkable, is entirely adequate.</Review>
            <Review>How to Train Your Dragon" and "Lilo &amp; Stitch" are completely indicative of the experience you'll have with "The Croods," which is to say a supremely positive one.</Review>
            <Review>It may not be an instant animated classic, but it's a charmer that will leave the kids ... feeling warm and fuzzy ...</Review>
            <Review>"The Croods" survives an unsteady second act thanks to a sturdy beginning (including a lovely introductory sequence) and an even sturdier conclusion.</Review>
            <Review>The first act may be a little slow, but once this animated comedy gets rolling, it's a rollicking good family movie with upbeat messages and a happy ending-with enough eye-popping peril to interest even the most jaded of your teen video gameplayers.</Review>
            <Review>A fun glimpse into father-daughter relationships and the power of family to persevere even when the fear of change threatens its very existence.</Review>
            <Review>Boisterous, colourful and warm-hearted, with energetic action scenes, knockabout slapstick humour and lush visuals.</Review>
            <Review>An animated film that has it all: captivating characters, rich thematic material, humor, imaginative visuals, and an adventuresome quest.</Review>
            <Review>Set four million years in the past, The Croods nonetheless feels like a step-forward for the usually pop-culture cribbing DreamWorks' studio. More like this, please.</Review>

            <Review>There's wonder here that films with quadruple the effects budget would kill for.</Review>
            <Review>The film is more guileful than it looks, even though the narrative is nuts ...</Review>
            <Review>No comedy classic, then, but a good natured and engaging slice of goonish self-mockery.</Review>
            <Review>... the movie definitely struck a chord with the crowd I saw it with ... (with) a climax that brings bromance back ...</Review>
            <Review>This Is the End, true to its subject matter, is as funny as hell.</Review>
            <Review>Crass, flimsily plotted, and self-referential to the point of narcissistic personality disorder. For those willing to tolerate such defects, however, it is also very, very funny.</Review>
            <Review>Seth Rogen, employing Appatow's Hollywood frat-house clown-crew, has made a unique, hilarious, bizarre, thoroughly disgusting, yet rather important movie for these times.</Review>
            <Review>Come for the cameos, stay for Danny McBride, and come back again for the handful of genuinely deranged sequences that you'll hardly believe exist in a mainstream comedy.</Review>
            <Review>"This Is the End" does not crack jokes at the expense of Christianity. It does, however, consider both kicking a severed head around like a football and the prospect of raping Emma Watson to be hilarious.</Review>
            <Review>This movie is flat out crazy.</Review>
            <Review>The movie's very self-amusement makes it go down easy.</Review>
            <Review>Probably the most self-indulgent wank in movie history, yet on occasion it's hilarious.</Review>

Secretly recorded audio diaries and telephone calls with Johnny Cash from the 1960s and 1970s reveal a brand new side of the legendary singer. An intense personal adventure that just happens to feature one of 20th-century music's greatest icons, MY FATHER AND THE MAN IN BLACK tells the inside story of 'bad boy' Johnny Cash and his talented but troubled manager, Saul Holiff, whose unexplained suicide leaves a son searching for his father in the shadow of a legend.

            <Review>You get a strong whiff of what it must have been like to be Johnny Cash, or his exasperated manager, from this film. It would make a good companion piece to "Walk the Line.</Review>
            <Review>It's good that Holiff wants to unlock this puzzle, but Cash is so compelling a figure that he is ultimately the only character we truly care about.</Review>
            <Review>This has the potential to be dreadfully maudlin stuff, but the film is too damn interesting to be maudlin.</Review>
            <Review>Here these men are but ciphers; we want understanding, but we get only suggestion.</Review>
            <Review>Despite the clunky mix of narrative formats, "My Father and the Man in Black" makes for an illuminating alternate history of sorts to the Hollywoodized version of Cash's ascendancy in "Walk the Line."</Review>
            <Review>Partly transcends its inherent self-indulgence.</Review>
            <Review>It's certainly a more enlightening look than any big-budget Hollywood biopic could offer.</Review>
            <Review>A strong story without the reconstructions. . . son/director could have trusted the powerful audio-visual material. . . instead of overplaying the reenactments and narration.</Review>
            <Review>My Father And The Man In Black is partly a biography of Saul Holiff, partly an account of Jonathan Holiff's relationship with his dad, and never particularly successful as either.</Review>
            <Review>In-the-family documentaries are often more emotionally rewarding for their makers than their viewers.</Review>
            <Review>This film is rather like BBC's Who Do You Think You Are?, but with altogether too many scenes re-enacted by lookalikes.</Review>
            <Review>For Cash devotees who want a hitherto-hidden perspective on their man ... this is invaluable viewing.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>91</Duration>
        <StoryLine>In 100 BLOODY ACRES, brothers Reg and Lindsay Morgan are struggling to keep their organic blood and bone fertilizer business in motion. Their secret "recipe" for success (using dead car crash victims in their product) was a huge boon to business, but lately supply has been gravely low. Months have passed since their last find, and an important new customer is now waiting on a delivery. When junior partner Reg (Damon Herriman of Justified) stumbles upon 3 travelers stranded on a remote country road, he cooks up a radical solution to their problem, and a way of finally gaining the respect of his bossy big brother (Angus Sampson). But when Reg starts to fall for Sophie, one of the intended victims, things get complicated... A bloody good time, the Cairnes' brothers witty horror-comedy blends sly Australian humor, gory fun, and a clever storyline that gives "recycling" a whole new context.

            <Review>100 Bloody Acres is as mercurial as its central character, breezily offbeat one moment, spattered in gonzo gore the next. It's as if the filmmakers ground the bits of other movies fine enough that it made a rich foundation for their own.</Review>
            <Review>This is a smartly written and acted and exceptionally well-directed movie.</Review>
            <Review>It sounds appalling, but "100 Bloody Acres" has a spring in its step.</Review>
            <Review>This fairly rote tale of rural ghouls and their passing-through prey has its own hick charm, mostly because of performers who never overplay their hands.</Review>
            <Review>"100 Bloody Acres" is gory good fun.</Review>
            <Review>Though entertaining enough as a genre exercise, the film is too simplistic to transcend its base concept.</Review>
            <Review>A very funny comedy of errors material that's delivered in a broad and very bloody fashion.</Review>
            <Review>100 Bloody Acres is yet another cheap'n'cheerful Australian comedy-horror film, made with gusto by Colin and Cameron Cairnes.</Review>
            <Review>It's taken three years for this negligible Aussie splatterfest to get its one-weekend-only release; you wonder why anybody thought to rescue it.</Review>
            <Review>The film tries too hard to be the next big thing in horror comedy and ends up a trite rehash of genre tropes.</Review>
            <Review>Crossing Sweeny Todd with Tucker and Dale Vs Evil, the Cairns boys deliver a lot of laughs, nice and realistic dollops of sticky gore, and quite a lot of heart to boot.</Review>
            <Review>A potently satirical realisation of what "dog eat dog" business strategy really means.</Review>

            <Review>An initially intriguing but ultimately exhausting tale of grieving parents left quite literally dazed and confused in the wake of their young son's death.</Review>
            <Review>Orser, to his credit, never resorts to psychobabble, cheap sentiment or emotional shortcuts.</Review>
            <Review>It often seems like an acting workshop: Behave as if you are the parent of a dead child.</Review>
            <Review>Leland Orser makes a raw, soul-searching feature debut as writer, director and star in "Morning." He plays the devastated father opposite his real-life wife, Jeanne Tripplehorn.</Review>
            <Review>One of the more harrowing explorations of grief ever brought to the screen. By the end of its 95 minutes, only a faint ray of light has penetrated the gloom.</Review>
            <Review>The effort here counts for something, but the emotions may be just too much.</Review>
            <Review>Too much of the same emotion and too little back-story doom this movie to tedium.</Review>
            <Review>It's a difficult sit, and not nearly as moving as it should be, with its central idea of lost communication buried under layers of artificiality, damming the mournful flow.</Review>
            <Review>Though mourning is a part of the human cycle, Morning is not an easy film to watch -- save for the great acting by the entire cast.</Review>
            <Review>Mr. Orser is a director worth watching. His work behind the camera-as well as in front of it-is clean and direct, unsentimental almost to the point of austerity.</Review>
            <Review>As an exercise in grief, Orser's drama is affecting, exhausting and something of a shortcut ...</Review>
