            <Review>It's unspeakably depressing to see Anna Paquin playing the mom (of a teenager!), but the pointlessness and mediocrity of the Paquin-produced "Free Ride" is even more depressing.</Review>
            <Review>The result, while sincere and nicely evoked, feels choppy, familiar and, despite the script's heavily stacked deck - and a few harrowing episodes - lacks sufficient momentum.</Review>
            <Review>From top to bottom, it feels authentic, and its laid-back, nonjudgmental tone evokes the easygoing world of Jimmy Buffett songs celebrating how changes in latitude bring changes in attitude.</Review>
            <Review>While this true-life odyssey should be the basis for a compelling drama or even a taut thriller, slack direction and a weak screenplay undermine the plot's inherent tension.</Review>
            <Review>In between bizarrely low-octane moments of authorities circling the ring, the soulful up-and-comer crafts a far more perilous tale, one of a teenage caretaker getting a crash course in growing up too fast, too soon.</Review>
            <Review>The film is content to merely document certain happenings and hope you find them as interesting as it does.</Review>
            <Review>Shana Betz's too-insistent refusal to commit to the melodramatic or to the suspenseful only makes the film seem like empty dramatization.</Review>

            <Review>A campus comedy that tries to transcend its many formulaic elements with an insufficient dose of absurdism.</Review>
            <Review>"HairBrained" is painfully contrived and self-consciously quirky from the word go.</Review>
            <Review>Unfortunately, the movie lacks strong enough players to fill in subtext to Mr. Kent's formulaic setups, and the story flounders once Ms. Posey is out of the picture.</Review>
            <Review>Aside from some nice autumnal shots of Ivy League college campuses, there's nothing in HairBrained to sustain much interest.</Review>
            <Review>Early potential fizzles away too quickly in this underachieving buddy comedy, which just barely skids along on the charm of its co-stars.</Review>
            <Review>Billy Kent's charming HairBrained comes from a long legacy of collegiate comedies but still finds its own identity.</Review>
            <Review>HairBrained is enjoyable, lightweight entertainment and, for a story about a genius, it requires very little thinking.</Review>
            <Review>Think a poor man's cross of Napoleon Dynamite (2004) and Old School (2003) where a coming-of-age tale merges with a midlife crisis.</Review>
            <Review>Poorly thought-out serio-comedy</Review>
            <Review>HairBrained is a rather dumb comedy about a sharply intelligent mind, failing due to flat characters, cliched plotting and minimal laughs.</Review>
            <Review>Hairbrained has a lot of good stuff. There is nothing egregiously wrong with the film. It just needs more of that good stuff.</Review>
            <Review>Often caught trying too hard, forcing the feature into positions that fail to extract the simple joys of the premise and its idiosyncratic lead character.</Review>

            <Review>Yep, he's an odd one all right. You're likely to get tired of hearing about it pretty quick, though.</Review>
            <Review>Odd Thomas is an engagingly lightweight and occasionally visually inventive film that should appeal to Koontz fans and anyone else open to his whimsical approach to horror.</Review>
            <Review>An endearing, witty romantic dramedy-slash-supernatural-thriller about a small desert town in California beset by demonic apparitions and a satanic cabal of deranged would-be mass murderers.</Review>
            <Review>They've given this once-promising character a fate similar to death-a pretty bad movie.</Review>
            <Review>At once comic, tragic and goofily romantic, and resting too often on Odd's clarifying narration, this young-adult lark breaches the nonsense barrier with some regularity.</Review>
            <Review>Odd Thomas has high-speed chases, explosions, narrow escapes and masses of special effects-none special enough, I'm afraid, to save it from mediocrity.</Review>
            <Review>I've never read a Koontz novel, but I don't think his target audience is pre-teens. Sadly, I'm not sure anyone much older would find the [film] to be more than novelty.</Review>
            <Review>...easily stands as Sommers' most accomplished work to date.</Review>
            <Review>Nightmarish imagery, violence abounds in dark-humored tale.</Review>
            <Review>Even if "Off Thomas" would have likely had a more fruitful life on the small screen, it is still an enjoyably fast-paced way to spend 96 minuteswith a few additional surprises up its sleeve.</Review>
            <Review>The film fails to establish a consistent tone and never becomes truly funny or scary as a result.</Review>
            <Review>The best combination of scares, comedy, romance, eye-popping special effects and good ol' sass since 1990's "Ghost." At any rate, its a lot better than 1996's "The Frighteners."</Review>

            <Review>Despite its austere beauty, elegant triptych-like structure and faultlessly disciplined performances, "Camille Claudel 1915" still raises more questions than it answers ...</Review>
            <Review>Juliette Binoche, as Claudel, is occasionally touching, but as soon as interest flares, the movie suffocates it via endless takes of her suffering through daily chores.</Review>
            <Review>Whatever nuance the movie has, it owes to Binoche's performance; despite the material and visual context, she's able to convey a sense of contradiction and inner life.</Review>

            <Review>One of the year's thorniest releases.</Review>
            <Review>With a stripped-down, bare-faced performance, Juliette Binoche is utterly wonderful in this tense French drama.</Review>
            <Review>A powerhouse performance by Juliette Binoche provides the beating, tortured heart of this finely wrought and very affecting film about the later life of sculptor Camille Claudel.</Review>
            <Review>This is a stark film, about the human condition at its most base and degraded.</Review>
            <Review>This is a difficult film, but made with impressive formal rigour.</Review>
            <Review>This later history of Claudel, which stars Juliette Binoche, is spare, harsh and minimalistic, as one would expect from Bruno Dumont.</Review>
            <Review>Throughout it all, Binoche's face shivers with emotions that Claudel herself cannot pin down.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>90</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Director Brian Lindstrom employs interviews, archival footage, and videotaped depositions to tell the tragic story of James Chasse, and once promising artist from Portland, Oregon whose lifelong battle with schizophrenia was cut tragically short when he was brutalized to death by a group of local police officers. Despite the policemen's best attempts to convince witnesses that Chasse was a homeless drug dealer, those who had lived in the community for their entire lives knew the truth - that the man who died in police custody after suffering 16 broken ribs and a punctured lung was a troubled yet gentle soul who had likely committed no crime. An inspired writer, artist, and musician, Chasse had been an integral part of the Portland punk rock scene before the onset of severe schizophrenia. In the years that followed, Chasse waged a valiant struggle to live independently. Later, in the aftermath of Chasse's shocking death, his family hits a series of frustrating road blocks while fighting to hold the policeman who killed him accountable for their actions.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Though the film is generally sedate for its first hour-plus, small moments of violence sporadically keep us on our toes just as Allie is.</Review>
            <Review>Geoff Marslett's Loves Her Gun studies the fine line between rational and irrational fear, as well as what it means to feel safe.</Review>

            <Review>This is Marslett's first live-action film (his SXSW 2010 favorite, Mars, was animated), and it's a promising start.</Review>

            <Review>Sexy and soapy, this modern-day romance about sexually adventurous couples mixing things up is a gem.</Review>
            <Review>Evans directs energetically, and the personable actors help to keep us involved, but the picture skims stubbornly along the surface.</Review>
            <Review>An engaging look at a pair of New York couples whose love lives intersect, crisscross, circle and backtrack in hip and provocative ways.</Review>
            <Review>Strong acting and occasional dives into deeper territory redeem this somewhat contrived chamber piece.</Review>
            <Review>Deadly earnestness and sex don't mix well at the movies.</Review>
            <Review>Romantic confusion and youthful insecurity drive "The Happy Sad," a New York relationship roundelay as restless as the city itself.</Review>
            <Review>You almost need a score card to keep track of all the coupling, uncoupling, and re-coupling, but the out-of-the-closet antics are amusing enough to intrigue.</Review>
            <Review>An intriguing urban subject is completely done in by a dreary, banal script, making you wonder why we should care about these wannabe hipsters.</Review>
            <Review>Despite a fairly obvious metaphor that matters of sexuality are far from "black and white," the film is refreshing in its lack of racial politics. But, despite very good performances, the movie falls short.</Review>
            <Review>It may have the trappings of your everyday NYC indie, but it stands apart for exploring love and lust in a world where sexuality and race aren't the sources of the drama.</Review>
            <Review>Ken Urban, adapting his own play, fumbles at injections of urban, and decidedly not urbane, levity, in addition to telegraphing entire subplots.</Review>
            <Review>Reducing complex relationship issues to a typical indie-flick blatherathon-complete with performances of varying quality and stilted dialogue-isn't helping anyone.</Review>

            <Review>The ending to this fable misses the opportunity for broader metaphorical resonance, but getting there has its own unnerving rewards.</Review>
            <Review>"Contracted" can best be described as "Contagion" meets "Blue Is the Warmest Color," without all those explicit sex scenes.</Review>
            <Review>There's no payoff to the paranoia.</Review>
            <Review>A body-horror opus that will satisfy genre fans who like to be grossed out, but doesn't have much to offer on any other count.</Review>
            <Review>A thoughtful and wonderfully cringe-inducing body horror story, Contracted is an often frightening and nasty exploration of isolation and desperation that grabs hold from the start and doesn't let up until the film's bitter conclusion.</Review>
            <Review>A very adult and straight faced glimpse at an ugly human being rotting from the inside out...</Review>
            <Review>Contracted is an efficiently icky, gross-out exercise in body horror that should please fans of this kind of thing. Still, the lack of any substance below the surface is ultimately too frustrating to ignore.</Review>
            <Review>Our inability to identify with [Townshend] means we can't identify with the film's central horror, and thus "Contracted" isn't all that unsettling.</Review>
            <Review>By being the director/writer and co-producer, England the writer didn't have an independent director to say, "Hey, the ending needs to be stronger!" or "What's the movie saying about lesbians having sex with men?"</Review>
            <Review>None of it feels remotely believable but also isn't broadly defined enough to be satire, falling in that dull gap in the middle.</Review>
            <Review>Contracted goes all-out on the gross-out.</Review>
            <Review>It's hard to make out what, if anything, writer-director Eric England is trying to say about the fragility of the flesh with Contracted, which amounts to little more than a slow-motion replay of The Fly's central gross-out.</Review>

Years later, Vajra (former Shaolin monk Xing Yu) has earned a reputation as the Emperor's top assassin. But Vajra has never forgiven the temple for causing the death of his brother, and after escaping back to China, he begins a grueling campaign to bring down the Temple of Hades with his bare hands. Now, the very people who shaped Vajra into a lethal weapon will find out just how much damage he can really do. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>JAMESY BOY is the story of teenager James Burns (played by Spencer Lofranco) who goes from the suburban street gangs to a maximum-security prison cell surrounded by hardened criminals.

            <Review>True second-chance story doesn't come to life onscreen.</Review>
            <Review>A film with a message of inspiration, to be sure, but not much in terms of innovation.</Review>
            <Review>For such a seriously street film, Jamesy Boy has some surprisingly sappy moments. But the redemptive ending, while thin, is genuinely gratifying.</Review>
            <Review>The screenplay by Lane Shadgett and director Trevor White relies far too much on telling rather than showing.</Review>
            <Review>White's decision to shackle his film to a redemptive arc ends up making Burns's story an argument for juvenile imprisonment.</Review>
            <Review>Tackled with a sense of thoughtfulness and compassion that makes the would-be garden-variety narrative worthwhile.</Review>
            <Review>The protagonist seems more sociopathic than sympathetic, and the film takes such a distorted view of the responsibility of role models and artistic expression in shaping troubled youth.</Review>
            <Review>It's ultimately little more than the story of a hot-tempered young man who made a lot of bad choices, didn't like where they got him, and finally started making some better ones. While that's admirable, it isn't inherently compelling.</Review>
            <Review>With Jamesy Boy on their IMDb filmographies, both White and Lofranco are ones to watch.</Review>
            <Review>Although the plot is formulaic, the strong performances and the empathetic main character make this drama stand out.</Review>
            <Review>Sans nuance and much-needed depth, the end result feels underwhelming, bland and undercooked. Up-and-coming Spencer LoFranco shows promise as an actor.</Review>
            <Review>A well-intentioned coming-of-age drama that never pushes past a comfortable orbit of earnestness in search of deeper truths.</Review>

            <Review>As it zigs and zags, its plot unravels rather than tightens, and its curveball of an ending is bound to leave audiences feeling as double-crossed as some of the characters.</Review>
            <Review>You've got your duplicitous blonde, a briefcase full of money, the hapless patsy, the angry cop, the loose cannon and the speeding train. Everything's so in order that you could doze off and catch up with the plot within seconds of reawakening.</Review>
            <Review>It's enjoyable enough, but low on novelty, beyond the stark beauty of the sun-bleached Outback landscape.</Review>
            <Review>As the title of "Swerve" suggests, there's a lot of driving, and cars and characters veer, though never far enough for either to arrive at some place, some narrative, that's remotely new.</Review>
            <Review>The story is uninspired, Lyons looks lost, and Booth makes for a bland femme fatale.</Review>
            <Review>The more narrative wrenches this modern-day noir throws at its characters-notably several literally physics-defying leaps of logic-the less involving it becomes. There are a few too many twists on this highway.</Review>
            <Review>If you can grin and bear the fact something always comes up to replace the previous problem just solved, there is entertainment to be had.</Review>
            <Review>Swerve plays out like a down under version of No Country for Old Men, sapped of any sense of tension, logic or charm.</Review>
            <Review>A series of winding roads lead nowhere in this low-budget Australian thriller.</Review>
            <Review>But for the most part, the most shocking thing about Swerve is how utterly straightforward it is.</Review>
            <Review>Almost all the parts of Swerve -- the predictable storyline, thin cast and flaccid action -- feel worn-out and second-hand. They still work, but they're not much fun to watch.</Review>
            <Review>A watchable genre exercise.</Review>

            <Review>Disney has another hit in its repertoire with this heartfelt story of sisterly love and one of the few films released in 3-D this year that splendidly incorporates the technology into the plot line.</Review>
            <Review>Frozen is a glacially stiff, perpetually unamusing animated musical with a talk-singing score that will leave one pining for the lifeless soundtrack to The Princess and the Frog.</Review>
            <Review>Frozen reminds you how many animated films rely more on inside jokes. It's modern without being hip, earnest with being sappy.</Review>
            <Review>Extravagant care is taken with minutiae, and the directors, Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, whistle through the first twenty minutes of the plot with a controlled giddiness that would leave many live-action adventures staggering in their tracks.</Review>
            <Review>If you thought there was only so much to be done with ice and snow as visual fields, think again along the lines of prismatic crystals, epic storms and fantastical structures built on water's gift for freezing itself into see-through art.</Review>
            <Review>Frozen' has both showtunes and darkness, but most satisfying is a formula-defying finale that successfully subverts the fairytale status quo.</Review>
            <Review>I was not disappointed.</Review>
            <Review>While it won't go down as one of Disney's greatest animations, Frozen has enough charm and silliness-a word I use complimentary-to make it a must-see for families.</Review>
            <Review>'Frozen' feels like it's breaking new ground in telling a story where the women are actually in control, and where the clichés of their narratives are turned inside out, almost as a sly commentary on what has come before.</Review>
            <Review>Old-school musical numbers, feisty princesses, funny sidekicks and a mix of action, comedy and romance come together in Frozen, a Disney animation that works hard to keep everyone happy.</Review>
            <Review>[Its] target audience should adore the characters, the visuals, and the music, but more importantly, they'll be bequeathed with a message worthy of their hearts and minds.</Review>
            <Review>Given the strength of animation, the memorable characters, and a killer soundtrack ... it may well be one of Disney's most accomplished animated features from the past 20 years.</Review>

            <Review>Daniel Radcliffe is back in a pair of nerdy specs as Allen Ginsberg in this sincere, heartfelt film about how the gay beat poet found his voice</Review>
            <Review>Bursting with hipster attitude and New York atmosphere, the fact-based "Kill Your Darlings" is a coming-of-age chronicle that morphs into a crime story without missing a beat.</Review>
            <Review>You don't need to know the Beats to understand "Kill Your Darlings," you just need to know the twinkling promise, and dark turns, of life.</Review>
            <Review>Overall the movie seems to wander, like the worst excesses of free verse, needing a little structure to rein it in.</Review>
            <Review>"Kill Your Darlings" is a true-crime murder mystery, a love letter to the wild-living artists of the Beat Generation, and a portrait of the artist as an adolescent.</Review>
            <Review>Dramatizing a passion for the written word on film can be tricky, but in his feverish Kill Your Darlings, first-time director John Krokidas brings creative desire to life with vigor and emotion.</Review>
            <Review>Krokidas' film takes a wisely neutral view of the tale, meaning that we get to both revel in the lads' transgressions and see how all this indulgence can turn sour.</Review>
            <Review>The sensual chemistry between Radcliffe and Dane DeHaan is fantastic, just occasionally upstaged by Ben Foster, who does a great job capturing the voice and mannerisms of the dry Burroughs.</Review>
            <Review>Beat movies are just a sign that a new wave of such whiners has arrived to see them, and, because movies take years to make, is probably already progressing beyond the adolescent obsessions that the moviemakers thought to capitalize on.</Review>
            <Review>Few [Harry] Potter fans will be tempted to chance their luck while most adults will be left with fearsomely bright but relatively unlovable characters.</Review>
            <Review>The best thing about the enthralling, super-smart Kill Your Darlings is director John Krokidas's ability to capture the excitement of young men's minds on fire.</Review>
            <Review>Kill Your Darlings is by no means perfect, but it's an ambitious and promising first film that gives a handful of young actors the chance to work with a director who has a great deal on his mind.</Review>

        <Duration>98</Duration>
        <StoryLine>HERE COMES THE DEVIL combines modern indie filmmaking and storytelling with a hint of '70s-styled psychological horror that may not just be psychological. Francisco Barreiro and Laura Caro play parents Felix and Sol whose preteen son and daughter inexplicably reappear after being lost overnight on a desolate, cave-riddled mountainside after a casual hike became every parent's nightmare. The good luck and good fortune of their return soon changes, as the children's behavior suggests ominous and unspeakable events the night the children were lost that continue even now. As a loving couple - and loving parents - try to care for and protect their children, the ancient and half-whispered legends around the caves and the mountain and those who have gone there before become too strange to believe ... and too dangerous, no matter how insane, to ignore.

            <Review>An auteur like Carlos Reygadas would have taken this in a worthwhile direction, and he did something like this with his significantly artier film Post Tenebras Lux.</Review>
            <Review>"Here Comes the Devil" is a horror movie. The problem is that writer-director Adrián García Bogliano can't decide what kind of horror movie he wants it to be.</Review>
            <Review>A muddled supernatural thriller that fails to capitalize on either its horrific prologue or eerie location.</Review>
            <Review>Fond of lurching weirdness, jarring inserts and sonic loudness, Bogliano shows he's invested as much in conveying the psychodrama of a fractured home as he is the signposts of edgy, bloody retro-infused terror.</Review>
            <Review>Bogliano keeps the focus on the psychology rather than the bloodlust, so "Here Comes The Devil" rises above the schlock of typical horror.</Review>
            <Review>Bogliano's unnerving mood, complemented by grungy camerawork and a shroud of sonic chaos, provides an emotional strain that makes anything possible.</Review>
            <Review>The film builds to an effectively tense climax, but spends much of its runtime bogged down by tonally incongruous sub-plots that alternate between boring and nonsensical.</Review>
            <Review>There's probably a frightening movie in there somewhere, or at least a darkly intriguing one, but this version can't unravel the chills of a half-glimpsed mystery.</Review>
            <Review>Fuses the grindhouse with the arthouse into an interesting but unsatisfying hybrid.</Review>
            <Review>Has mood but no real presence, making the movie a grab bag of lustful encounters and skin-ripping gore, while submitting the most vaginally-inspired imagery of the film year.</Review>

            <Review>Nelson Mandela gets the Classics Illustrated treatment with this handsome, undemanding biopic.</Review>
            <Review>The life of Nelson Mandela is simply too big, too complex and too important to be contained in one movie.</Review>

            <Review>Aside from some youthful randiness early in the film, it wouldn't be out of place at a state funeral.</Review>
            <Review>Long Walk to Freedom is a solidly crafted drama and a timely reminder of Mandela's achievements. The younger generation and those who haven't read the autobiography may find it fascinating.</Review>
            <Review>No matter how savvy the screenwriter, it's hard to adapt a 600-page autobiography to the silver screen.</Review>
            <Review>This Justin Chadwick biopic offers no surprises in technique or script (by William Nicholson) but is nevertheless a notch above average.</Review>
            <Review>This film is only superficially illuminating, briefly informative; the drama is only mildly engaging, the imprisonment distantly horrific. It insists upon keeping us at an arm's length for its not inconsiderable running time.</Review>
            <Review>A potent mix of uplift and corn.</Review>
            <Review>This film fails to be more than a flawed, overly reverential and not particularly engrossing adaptation (with some strong performances) of some of the all too well-known highlights of a fascinating life.</Review>

            <Review>If only this set of memorable characters were serving a story that didn't feel half-rate.</Review>
            <Review>A movie as smart as 'American Hustle' knows that those tactile pleasures only matter if they're attached to some kind of emotional resonance.</Review>
            <Review>If American Hustle has anything real to say, it's some minor bromide about greed and corruption. Ultimately, like its central characters, it's is all about 'tude; of that, it's got a ton.</Review>
            <Review>There's not a lot of takeaway from American Hustle, but that's Russell's personality-he's got a great appetite for verve and foolhardy spectacle, rather than reverb and real-life substance.</Review>
            <Review>Full of agreeable performances and a few "aha" moments that most filmmakers would kill for, but it never comes together in any meaningful way.</Review>

            <Review>Forget super. This bighearted and intelligent drama is supercalifragili. . . .you get the idea</Review>
            <Review>The whole thing leaves you with an appalling chill. It feels like a warning from Hollywood to the ambivalent creators of anything: Take the spoonful of sugar or we'll force-feed it to you.</Review>
            <Review>Pencil Thompson in now for an Oscar nomination, and maybe a win, and prepare to leave the theater humming the iconic songs.</Review>
            <Review>The sap doesn't run too thick, although it does run, and the movie certainly has a patented Disney upbeat feel much of the time. It's more a spoonful of sugar than medicine for aging baby boomer's souls.</Review>
            <Review>Smart, delightful.</Review>
            <Review>Saving Mr Banks is a merciless film. It hits you with every sentimental low blow it can think of. Then it pounds you again. And when you're down, it jumps on you.</Review>
            <Review>There is a lot of tricky narrative positioning in the script that works in building momentum, but it often feels so manipulated that it's tough to keep your eyes from rolling.</Review>
            <Review>It may be the most self-congratulatory bit of hagiography Hollywood has ever produced, and that's saying something.</Review>
            <Review>Although at times overly sweet and emotional, Saving Mr. Banks is for the most part warm, heartfelt and easy to like. It's hard not to appreciate the Disney magic once again on display here.</Review>
            <Review>Viewers raised on "Mary Poppins" will be unable to resist the warm embrace of "Saving Mr. Banks."</Review>
            <Review>With a few distorted facts, Saving Mr. Banks takes on a life of its own, and there's enough truth in it to make you swallow the rest . . . with or without a spoonful of sugar.</Review>
            <Review>Saving Mr. Banks works well under the directorial style of John Lee Hancock, but its real mark will be left thanks to the multifaceted Thompson.</Review>

        <Title>A Brief History of Time</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 1991</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>85</Duration>
        <StoryLine>A Brief History of Time is based on cosmologist Stephen Hawking's 1988 bestseller of the same name. This anecdotal film concerns itself as much with Hawking's day-to-day life as it does with his unorthodox theories about the universe. Only the most close-minded viewer will be bothered by the ALS-suffering Hawking's physical appearance and his inability to move and speak without assistance (as narrator of the film, he utilizes a voice synthesizer, which he capriciously refers to as "my American accent"). Director Errol Morris inventively adopts a semi-dramatized approach to his interviews with Hawking's friends and relatives: they all appear in fabricated sets, and are lovingly photographed and lit as if they were starring in a film. Though of necessity a "talking heads" effort, A Brief History of Time is also cunningly and subtly cinematic. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>Morris. Hawking. Two of my favorite artists together. It couldn't miss, and it didn't.</Review>
            <Review>[The film has] a sophisticated agenda that's more about association than data or personal trivia, and Morris' philosophy takes it to places a conventional documentary could never go.</Review>
            <Review>A really fun ride.</Review>
            <Review>It's accessible, informative and entertaining.</Review>
            <Review>A capable documentary, but the title's misleading. It's more about Hawking himself than the book this docu takes its name from.</Review>

            <Review>A mindfield of idiocy and neglect in this poorly executed thriller. Truthfully, everyone is to blame. Only Howitt had the right idea to peel his name off the finished product.</Review>
            <Review>A ramshackle delivery vehicle for Dominic Cooper's misadventures in accent and the sort of disinterested glowering that Samuel L. Jackson reliably pulls out for paycheck gigs.</Review>

            <Review>The Flu can best be described as South Korea's answer to Contagion. If it wasn't for the film's massive amount of theatrics in an already harrowing story, The Flu would be the best disaster film to come along since The Tower.</Review>

            <Review>The ancient Eastern tradition is demonstrably beneficial for both mind and body, but its execution can be so boring and its teachers so painfully earnest.</Review>
            <Review>Doing yoga proves more appealing than watching a film promote it.</Review>
            <Review>Yogawoman clearly is a fan of yoga and of women. And as it gently reminds us, these two special interests have not always been compatible.</Review>
            <Review>With a stronger narrative spine and a little more sense of gender-gap curiosity, Yogawoman could bridge the gap between faithful yoga adherents and a general audience. As is, it does not.</Review>
            <Review>For what it is, the film is entirely feel-good, lauds women who are making positive changes in the world, and, if nothing else, provides a reminder to at least stretch once in a while.</Review>
            <Review>A pleasant and pretty polemic narrated by a serene Annette Bening, Yogawoman presents the ancient practice of yoga as a cure-all for the physical and spiritual ills of today's women.</Review>

            <Review>There are just so many ways Carine Roitfeld can say she loves fashion in "Mademoiselle C," a somewhat interesting documentary that brings us into the inner workings of a magazine, but harps a bit too much on her ideas of fashion and style.</Review>
            <Review>Unfortunately, the film doesn't show its subject's creative process as much as that of her collaborators ...</Review>
            <Review>For fashion junkies, Mademoiselle C will be like five September issues of Vogue all rolled into one.</Review>
            <Review>As a distinctly not-insider ... I would have benefited more from a broader portrait of the woman herself, and how she became such a legend.</Review>
            <Review>As vanity projects go, this one's unusually well-made - as any portrait of an iconic stylist ought to be.</Review>
            <Review>Roitfeld seems constantly inspired by the prospect of pushing boundaries and expectations, and that, in turn, is inspiring to watch.</Review>
            <Review>...hard to follow, relatively incoherent,...she is shown as a peripatetic presence, with seeming indefatigable energy. But she talks so much during the first hour that it becomes enormously annoying...</Review>
            <Review>A lively but exasperatingly incurious and obsequious work about Carine Roitfeld, the former Vogue Paris editor-in-chief who quit the Condé Nast empire in 2011 to start her own publication called CR Fashion Book.</Review>
            <Review>It's a film which treats its audience like beggars wallowing in the gutter.</Review>
            <Review>High in gloss if not necessary insight, this is manna for fashion fans but a marginally slighter piece of work than The September Issue.</Review>
            <Review>Fantastic access, if minimal drama.</Review>
            <Review>Fabien Constant's doc about ultimate fashionista Carine Roitfeld will be catnip to the style-obsessed, while definitely showing that a lot of hard work goes into those all glossy images one carelessly flips through.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>Salva certainly gets points for creative repurposing. Much of what transpires in "Dark House" has been seen before, just not all in the same movie.</Review>
            <Review>Mere minutes into "Dark House," it becomes depressingly clear that the deficit of imagination displayed by the title will not be made up for by the content.</Review>
            <Review>There's plenty of blood in the supernatural horror flick "Dark House," but what really defines director Victor Salva's latest effort is flop sweat.</Review>
            <Review>Sometimes there's a thin line between terrifying and goofy.</Review>
            <Review>Dark House is one nutty horror movie, but what's crazier still is how well it works - until it doesn't.</Review>
            <Review>Doesn't always work as a cohesive whole, but it does have more than a few good moments.</Review>
            <Review>Dark House could really benefit from an Extreme Home Makeover, because as it stands, this is one architectural mess of a horror film.</Review>
            <Review>Dark House is lame. What it lacks in scares it more than makes up for in incomprehensible narrative choices</Review>
            <Review>This is a film that skips all the foreboding, and gives us scene after scene of just boding.</Review>
            <Review>The film's dialogue is knowing and the action sequences are elaborate, but only in ways that advance the shady story toward its hokey denouement.</Review>
            <Review>Dark House practically drowns under the weight of mismatched horror tropes, including a preponderance of loud-noise jolt-scares and idiotic character behavior.</Review>

            <Review>Van Damme's English is less intelligible than usual, and his line readings are sluggish in places. Improbably enough, this adds to the performance ...</Review>
            <Review>Mr. Hyams keeps things moving briskly, building to an ending with a pretty good plot twist.</Review>
            <Review>Suffers from wincingly bad dialogue delivered as if by jocks in a high-school play and action choreographed as if for a gymnasium stage.</Review>
            <Review>Enemies Closer belongs to a category of old-school action movies usually associated with the direct-to-video market: lean, brisk, and distinguished by a clean visual style and an emphasis on practical stuntwork over effects.</Review>
            <Review>A silly yet sturdily crafted time-filler ...</Review>
            <Review>If you don't expect anything groundbreaking or dramatically dynamic, you'll probably have just as much fun watching Enemies Closer as Van Damme, playing a total fruitcake of a villain, clearly did making it.</Review>
            <Review>Outrageous, unintentionally funny, cartoonish, dumb and consistently entertaining---in other words: the ultimate B-movie that's best watched at midnight with a group of friends while intoxicated.</Review>
            <Review>Too bad no one else in Enemies Closer can match Van Damme's oddball charisma.</Review>
            <Review>An agreeable way to kill 80 minutes.</Review>
            <Review>A reasonably engaging B-movie, benefiting from Van Damme's nutty performance and Hyams's dedication to cinematic economy. Surprises are few, outside of the eye-roll count, which is unexpectedly low.</Review>
            <Review>JCVD may not say it best, but he does say it aptly, when his manically cartoonish baddie caps one murder with the assertion that "shit happens."</Review>

            <Review>An entertaining, well-cast action thriller, but it grows increasingly mindless, pedestrian, contrived and convoluted.</Review>
            <Review>The film features a variety of kinetic and well choreographed action sequences but is strictly an exercise in style over substance.</Review>
            <Review>Enjoyable, if slightly tepid teenage spy actioner and a must-see for fans of KPop star T.O.P of Big Bang, Commitment's mix of gunplay and hand-to-hand combat is harder and bloodier than one might reckon for the film's expected demographic</Review>
            <Review>The story of an undercover spy caught in a web of intrigue, this South Korean import slams North Korean ruthlessness and treachery via a tale that's derivative and-in both dramatic and political terms-frustratingly shallow.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Four brave urban explorers descend into the crumbling underground tunnels beneath Berlin, and realize they may never make it out alive after encountering a mysterious stranger in this subterranean nail-biter from director Andy Fetscher. Six stories beneath the streets of Berlin, a complex maze of 25,000 tunnels house untold Nazi secrets. Determined to explore these winding caverns despite the fact that they have been purposely sealed off for the protection of the public, four young adventurers arrive at an inner city club to meet their guide, and explore the remnants of a dark chapter in history. But from the moment the group enters the tunnels, the mood underground turns ominous. In an attempt to discourage neo-Nazis from staking their claim on the city's shame, the German government closed off the tunnels permanently -- or so they thought. Now the deeper the explorers venture, the more lost and confused they become. Just when it begins to seem as if they will never find a way out, however, an outwardly benevolent old man rescues them, and tends to their wounds. Unfortunately for the unsuspecting trailblazers their savior is not who he appears to be, and by the time they realize this, it may already be too late. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>A down-and-dirty revenge picture whose classy cast elevates it above its gritty, grimy trappings.</Review>
            <Review>One of the best movies I've seen this year.</Review>
            <Review>'Out of the Furnace' is an actor's film, full of actor's actors. Being a former actor himself, the reviewer was in actor-heaven.</Review>
            <Review>The narrative is so straightforward that it requires the kind of flashbang storytelling that Cooper clearly isn't interested in.</Review>
            <Review>A humorless, ponderously solemn dirge that chokes on its own oppressive aura of self-importance.</Review>
            <Review>The grittiness of the tone... will bring to mind films ranging from The Fighter to The Deer Hunter, but it's that lack of cinematic gloss that makes the film come to life.</Review>
            <Review>Looking totally unlike his fattened persona in American Hustle, the unrestrained Bale offers explosive unpredictability fuelled by family loyalties.</Review>
            <Review>Beautifully shot in and around the depressed town of Braddock, Pa. Out of the Furnace is generally well acted by a top-notch cast, but a bit weak on the storytelling side.</Review>

            <Review>The movie lacks the nerve to treat death as anything more menacing than the tooth fairy.</Review>
            <Review>Markus Zusak's enormously successful young-adult novel seems to have been adapted as a movie for middle-aged children.</Review>
            <Review>"The Book Thief" may not be perfect, but it may steal your heart.</Review>
            <Review>Pretty visuals give an unexpectedly painful twist to other parts of the story.</Review>
            <Review>You just wonder if this film's audience might be happier at home, curled up with a book. "The Book Thief," perhaps.</Review>
            <Review>A tale of WWII Germany as seen through the eyes of a young girl, "The Book Thief" is unobjectionable, sentimental, and not a little dull.</Review>
            <Review>'The Book Thief' mixes British actors using German accents, a few German actors, and the occasional German word, creating a playfully successful illusion of German-ness.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately not much more complex than the moment in which two children yell "I hate Hitler" across a lake, it imparts the message that Nazis are bad, books are good, and Geoffrey Rush would make a great dad even in WWII Germany</Review>
            <Review>This extremely moving drama suggests the Holocaust story Ray Bradbury might have written: Events are seen through a child's eyes; books are shown to contain a healing, transformative power; and the supernatural is real, if symbolic.</Review>
            <Review>Zusak's story is stirring, and it holds the film up during most of its predictable parts, but The Book Thief never rises too far above that. The narration from Death only serves to make it more like some sort of fantastical fairy tale.</Review>
            <Review>Regrettably this poignant and profound story, does not feel very poignant nor profound at all.</Review>
            <Review>Showing tragic events through a child's eyes can be a powerful storytelling strategy, but there's something altogether too cosy and bland about Downton Abbey director Brian Percival's handling of the material here.</Review>

            <Review>"In Fear" takes a small task and a hooky premise and runs with them, providing some good jolts over the course of its barely-90-minute length.</Review>
            <Review>Rarely have so few commonplace ingredients produced so many uncommon chills.</Review>
            <Review>A wicked little horror film in which nearly all of the violence takes place in your head, "In Fear" expertly builds terror out of not much more than two people driving around in a car.</Review>
            <Review>Lovering keeps "In Fear" visually absorbing through unsettling close-ups and a well-paced series of scares.</Review>
            <Review>Imagine Funny Games (either version) without the meta-movie aspect. Even those annoyed by Michael Haneke's hectoring in those pictures must admit that there wouldn't be much left but random, pointless sadism without it.</Review>
            <Review>Logic is a torch we can use to fight our fears. If it flickers only dimly here, perhaps that's by design.</Review>
            <Review>If you've ever been lost at night on a road you've never seen before, you'll probably get a kick out of In Fear.</Review>
            <Review>In Fear was made for next to nothing but that is not always a virtue. After an adequate start its storyline goes precisely nowhere.</Review>
            <Review>A lost-in-the-woods horror predominantly set within a car's claustrophobic confines, this is certainly one of the better films of late to play with fear of the dark.</Review>
            <Review>Sometimes the most effective horror films come with the simplest premise and this is certainly the case with Jeremy Lovering's In Fear.</Review>
            <Review>In Fear finally feels disappointingly conventional, losing faith in its primitive method.</Review>
            <Review>In Fear is a slickly made, impressively pared-down horror/thriller but is too abstract for its own good - it is hard to feel any great emotional identification (or fear) for characters who so sketchily written.</Review>

            <Review>Directed by Atiq Rahimi and based on his novel, "The Patience Stone" speaks for all oppressed women, for all oppressed people for that matter.</Review>
            <Review>With a piercing edge, "The Patience Stone" is a cry from behind the veil, where a suffocating woman weaves a new life of her own design.</Review>
            <Review>The bare room where the husband lies helpless becomes a confessional where Farahani pours out the woman's life story in a performance that grabs you with its quiet yet searing power.</Review>
            <Review>A startling fantasy of Muslim feminist empowerment that allows the Iranian-born actress Golshifteh Farahani to put on what amounts to a one-woman show.</Review>
            <Review>The details of the woman's life are like a crash course in the sociology of a country living through turmoil ...</Review>
            <Review>A beautiful and haunting Afghan film about love, devotion, and a woman's 'duty'; a remarkable feminist story from the unlikeliest place on the planet.</Review>
            <Review>As it progresses the woman's story is paralleled with several religious myths and it builds to a conclusion that is terrifying, far-fetched and powerfully-realised. The final moments resonate with a mythic quality.</Review>
            <Review>It's Rahimi's courage as both writer and director that makes this intense and perceptive picture so unflinchingly compelling.</Review>
            <Review>A real one-off.</Review>
            <Review>By turns mysterious, moving, shocking and explicit - and very different from the kind of opaque and quietist cinema we might expect.</Review>

            <Review>Thin, intense and yet somehow cool, Kinnaman is on his way to stardom, and it's easy to see how these movies gave him lift off. This is a tough, crackling crime story, well-executed and tense throughout.</Review>
            <Review>A deep pool of underworld characters and a focus on multicultural tensions in Stockholm lend crime drama some added interest in "Easy Money: Hard to Kill" ...</Review>
            <Review>Given the substance that was already inherent in the material, it seems wasteful for the filmmakers to discard it for the sake of one more guns-cocked standoff.</Review>
            <Review>Because JW isn't the strutting, duplicitous peacock he was in the first movie, the role isn't as rewarding this time out.</Review>
            <Review>Though "Hard to Kill" forges new ground on the rich character histories developed in the first film, they feel like a random trio assigned the same punishment whose lives eventually intersect - and as such, the emotional moments never land.</Review>
            <Review>Najafi stages action scenes with an intense, queasy beauty and elevates what is in its outlines a routine crime drama to near-operatic proportions ...</Review>
            <Review>Babak Najafi's film weaves together all these threads, crafting a desperate narrative with violence as the inevitable outcome.</Review>
            <Review>The picture isn't radically inventive; [but] it's taut and vivid. The grimy window it opens onto a desperate, dangerous lifestyle makes viewers feel like accomplices.</Review>
            <Review>[S]uffers by comparison [to the original]... How Kinnaman plays JW's devastation, as seething, mounting rage, is the best thing about [it].</Review>
            <Review>...Easy Money: Hard To Kill does what sequels should-it widens the thematic playing area of the tale told so far, even while thinning out the cast further, and it makes us look forward, with only slightly tempered expectations, to installment 3.</Review>
            <Review>Easy Money: Hard To Kill is a safe follow-up for fans of the original, bringing back familiar characters while mirroring the same thrilling tone.</Review>
            <Review>Its combination of grit and fatalism won't be to all tastes, but it's a refreshing alternative to the bigger-is-way-better swamp in which most Hollywood crime movies are mired.</Review>

            <Review>By making Statham a regretful lawman, it neutralizes his main talent, effectively neutering him. It also telegraphs the kind of mostly watered-down movie we're about to see.</Review>

This time, a manipulative police crackdown on organized crime has ignited a tricky power struggle in the yakuza underworld. The Sanno crime family has grown into a massive organization dominated by young executives whose new approach to running the family is causing frustration and pent-up resentment with the old-guard members. This vulnerability in the Sanno hierarchy is exactly what anti-gang detective Kataoka has been looking for, as the police force prepares a full-scale crackdown. Kataoka wants start a war between Sanno and the neighboring Hanabishi crime family in the hopes that they destroy each other. His trump card is Otomo (Kitano) - the rumored-dead boss of a defunct family that was destroyed by the Sanno, who has just been released from prison. Otomo wants to retire from a life of crime, but finds himself drawn back in through Kataoka's manipulations as the Sanno and Hanabishi clans teeter on the brink of an all-out war.

            <Review>Kitano's considerable gifts as a screenwriter and stylist-namely, his talent for staging violent outbursts and conveying narrative through elliptical cuts-are enough to sustain the film as a twisty, cynical underworld yarn.</Review>

            <Review>The movie swings like a pendulum between elation and despair, with little time devoted to anything in between.</Review>
            <Review>Traditional bluegrass songs of loss and grief provide the inspiration and score for this innovative Belgian, Flemish-language musical drama.</Review>
            <Review>It's the music that really brings Broken Circle to life, an excellent collection of old-timey country classics and originals that reconnects the broken bits of the story and resonates with its deepest emotions.</Review>
            <Review>Breakdown gets the music right and has the benefit of strong acting, but its unapologetically melodramatic plot has a tendency to throw everything at you but the kitchen sink.</Review>
            <Review>Invigorating musical elements and the lead actors' potent chemistry can't entirely protect this tragic relationship drama from its encroaching shortage of subtlety.</Review>
            <Review>Breakdown's less convincingly scripted second half sputters more often than it shines.</Review>
            <Review>A significant amount of redemption arrives in its final moments, which find a way to bind itself with the heart of the picture we've been observing for nearly two hours.</Review>
            <Review>Constantly you worry that the movie will collapse under the strain of more raw emotions but it rarely falters and never lapses into the predictable or the sentimental.</Review>
            <Review>Fragmented and raw. A wrenching drama.</Review>
            <Review>More so than its music, Broken Circle's greatest merit are the compelling performances Van Groeningen cultivates from both his leads.</Review>
            <Review>I wish the patience and grace of the director's techniques in the film's strongest non-musical moments were matched in his depictions of the amazing music on display.</Review>
            <Review>It's a film about a couple whose tumultuous relationship is severely challenged, and the performances are excellent.</Review>

            <Review>Isaac's folk-singing Llewyn Davis may be an arrogant loser and the butt of a cosmic joke but he's something more than a cartoon. So is the movie ...</Review>
            <Review>The unreliable, brooding Llewyn is a prickly sort, making it a challenge for his industry - and movie audiences - to fully embrace him. And yet, the talent is undeniable.</Review>
            <Review>This is one of the strangest yet most satisfying movie experiences of the year, one of those films in which you can't really appreciate what you've seen until it's over. You just have to trust that the trip is worth the trouble. And it is.</Review>
            <Review>The broad, black humor of the Coens' early features has ripened over the years into a sadder, more philosophical brand of comedy (A Serious Man) that puts them in a class with Billy Wilder and Ernst Lubitsch (yeah, you heard me).</Review>
            <Review>The Coen brothers have crafted another unique period piece.</Review>
            <Review>Celebrating and mourning a bygone moment, "Inside Llewyn Davis" is a tuneful wake intended to arouse us from our slumber to desires worth remembering.</Review>
            <Review>This is the Coens in bittersweet mode, a little oblique, a little downbeat, and a little offbeat.</Review>
            <Review>The film is vintage Coen Brothers: quietly funny, a bit arch, and beautifully shot.</Review>
            <Review>They beautifully and convincingly recreate the streets and coffee shops where he dwells, and seem intoxicated with the look and feel of those surroundings.</Review>
            <Review>If failure and folly are this noble and touching, we're on Davis' side, even as the last chord is struck and the song is sung.</Review>
            <Review>The brothers Coen and their cast reward us with unexpected riches from a place now long gone, faded like a minor chord on a battered guitar.</Review>
            <Review>Joel and Ethan Coen have made some indelible films to date, but "Inside Llewyn Davis" is their most accomplished work yet. In short, it's a masterpiece.</Review>

            <Review>Khumba, despite being resoundingly terrible, will probably appeal to children in the same way that a Lucky Charms commercial or an inflatable bouncy castle would.</Review>
            <Review>Character movement occasionally has a stiff, disconnected quality, but the animators distinguish themselves with the weathered richness of their geographically unmistakable setting.</Review>
            <Review>"Khumba" is essentially cut-and-paste cinema. The film's creators borrow a lot from the "Madagascar" and "Ice Age" films, and while that doesn't sound that bad, "Khumba" is disastrously uninspired.</Review>
            <Review>Real-life nature is presented as more exotic, detailed and deeply felt than any fantasy world.</Review>
            <Review>The animation is vibrant and the voice cast impressive... So it's a great shame that the animators and actors are let down by the meandering plot and trite dialogue.</Review>
            <Review>When this South African animated adventure embraces its unique setting and characters, it's visually stunning and a lot of fun.</Review>
            <Review>The kids' movie market is crowded with superior specimens; they'll eat Khumba alive.</Review>

        <Title>JFK: The Smoking Gun</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>120</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Seventy-five percent of the American people still refuse to believe the official story of President John F. Kennedy's death. They do not think he was killed by a lone gunman but by a mysterious cabal that somehow conspired to have him killed. How can this be? How can a crime this famous, witnessed and investigated by so many, remain a mystery? This is what veteran Australian police detective Colin McLaren is determined to find out. JFK: The Smoking Gun follows the forensic cold-case investigation McLaren conducted over four painstaking years, taking us back to that tragic day in Dallas at Dealey Plaza where the shooting took place, to Parkland Hospital where the president was pronounced dead, to the Bethesda Naval Hospital where the autopsy was conducted and to the conclusions of the Warren Commission that have remained controversial to this day. Driven by a seasoned police detective who, thanks to modern technology, finally had access to all the facts and to witness testimony, the documentary uses logic, reason and time-tested investigative techniques to solve a crime that is every bit as shocking and incredible today as it was when it first happened 50 years ago. Colin McLaren believes he has found "the smoking gun" that killed JFK. Once you've seen this film, he's confident you will believe it, too.</StoryLine>

            <Review>An exhaustingly pretentious heave of artistic self-involvement, "The Time Being" takes an exceptionally handsome journey to nowhere at all.</Review>
            <Review>While the underdeveloped script - co-written by Richard Gladstein - never earns its sense of self-importance, the visuals are evocative enough to draw us further into the movie's ultimately unsatisfying mysteries.</Review>
            <Review>Not to be glib, but sitting through the art-centric chamber piece "The Time Being" is truly like watching paint dry.</Review>
            <Review>There reaches a point... at which the film settles into a deliberately-paced yet completely watchable groove, with the emphasis on the relationship between the two men ensuring that The Time Being ultimately succeeds as a low-key drama.</Review>
            <Review>The Time Being's calculated fabrication does look gorgeous onscreen, but at the same time hinders its audience from truly engaging with the story.</Review>
            <Review>Despite some powerful imagery, the film provides only minimal insight into the artistic process, and its characters aren't compelling enough to pick up the slack.</Review>
            <Review>Langella is solid as always, but his haunted, bitter character is pretty two-dimensional, and having to share all his scenes with Bentley doesn't allow for much interplay.</Review>

            <Review>[The actors are] all undermined by not just the clichéd story but director/co-writer Charles de Lauzirika's misguided tone, which veers from straight-up impotent fury to a clunky humor that's just not funny in the story's overall context.</Review>
            <Review>For those of you expecting a rousing tale of vigilante justice and psychological thrills, you'll sadly be craving a completely different film once you realize the one you're watching has a strong grasp on neither aspect.</Review>
            <Review>Crave is nothing but empty movie-shout-out posturing.</Review>
            <Review>The film's method of admitting its own hypocrisy so as to enable it to further indulge said hypocrisy grows more grating than if it were merely indifferently conceived junk like Falling Down.</Review>
            <Review>The fantasy urban vigilante pic ends with a whimper instead of a bang.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2012</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>81</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Codebreaker tells the remarkable and tragic story of one of the 20th century's most important people. Alan Turing set in motion the computer age and his World War II codebreaking helped turn the tide of the war. Instead of receiving accolades, Turing faced terrible persecution. In 1952, the British Government forced him to undergo chemical castration as punishment for his homosexuality. In despair, Turing committed suicide. He was only 41 years old. Documentary elements seamlessly interconnect with dramatic scenes in Codebreaker to offer the first complete picture of Turing, his accomplishments and his lasting legacy. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>This is Empire Strikes Back stuff. It has that second Star Wars movie's kick of confidence.</Review>
            <Review>Director Francis Lawrence's film runs nearly two-and-a-half hours but it concludes so abruptly and tantalizingly, it leaves you wanting more.</Review>
            <Review>The budget is nearly twice the original, and it shows. Great work from the A-list cast, amazing set designs and costumes.</Review>
            <Review>Now the violence is not merely physical, but existential. Far from having won her freedom as promised, Katniss is now imprisoned in a false public narrative-supporter of the Capitol, lover of Peeta-from which she may never escape.</Review>
            <Review>Catching Fire delivers on the grim, roiling promises of the original.</Review>
            <Review>The Hunger Games: Catching Fire takes the narrative and thematic liberties traditionally granted the middle chapter in a trilogy and drives the stakes up sharply.</Review>
            <Review>The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is much of the same: lots of standing around and talking without much in the way of flair or excitement.</Review>
            <Review>Every returning detail of The Hunger Games is expanded and expounded in Catching Fire, and there is an unusual layering of the film's ambitions.</Review>
            <Review>Vivid, visceral filmmaking, twisty and entertaining, with startlingly good turns by Jennifer Lawrence and Philip Seymour Hoffman.</Review>
            <Review>Just as good a film as its predecessor, and a must-see chapter in this terrific and terrifying story.</Review>
            <Review>The movies (gratefully) violently counteract any attempt we might make to see them as fun escapism.</Review>
            <Review>Whereas "The Hunger Games" made for some interesting political commentary, "Catching Fire" is content to rest on its laurels, adding nothing to the conversation.</Review>

            <Review>A tense little thriller that provides juicy roles for its deft lead actors, Alice Eve and Bryan Cranston, as well as some well-played action and several neat twists.</Review>
            <Review>Cold Comes the Night is a serviceable low-budget thriller with a pair of strong lead performances and intermittently suspenseful scenes.</Review>
            <Review>It's hard not to be impatient with a movie as openly lazy as "Cold Comes the Night," which is redeemed only by its performances.</Review>
            <Review>Cranston, in a fake beard and dark glasses, seems to be enjoying his goofy act. Trouble is, this isn't the kind of movie in which goofy earns goodwill.</Review>
            <Review>Cranston has plenty of menace left over following the end of Breaking Bad, and his fans will forgive the distracting Polish accent he keeps up through the film.</Review>
            <Review>The plot and characters all appear to be consequences of a group of writers that just didn't have a single iota of originality among the three of them, and as a result, it's simply not worth your time.</Review>
            <Review>...a better-than-average thriller...</Review>
            <Review>Derails in the end, trying to neatly wrap-up a picture that demands a more sophisticated conclusion, but the basics sustain allure, especially when they're competently performed.</Review>
            <Review>Cranston's accent is Dick-Van-Dyke-in-Mary-Poppins-bad.</Review>

            <Review>The movie's problems are, in part, those of a great artist trying something new. It's a fine mess.</Review>
            <Review>The Grandmaster blends right in with Wong's body of work, a gorgeous meditation on the importance of sorrow and lament. This one just happens to have kung fu, too.</Review>
            <Review>It ranks with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Hero and House of Flying Daggers as one of the most elegant and beautiful martial-arts films to play American screens.</Review>
            <Review>You leave this deeply flawed, deeply beautiful film with no doubt that you've seen an indisputable cinematic grandmaster in action.</Review>
            <Review>Wong Kar Wai is an expressionist master. A master of character - deep, rich, truthful character - especially in The Grandmaster, he is not.</Review>
            <Review>"The Grandmaster" can feel stiff at times, and something is doubtlessly lost in translation. But the precision and magic of Wong Kar Wai's camera is so captivating it doesn't matter.</Review>
            <Review>Wong Kar Wai's latest film is by turns elegant and frustrating, beautiful and hard to track, sumptuous and spartan.</Review>
            <Review>The Grandmaster thrives on the raw talent of its author.</Review>
            <Review>Kung fu masters kick dents in iron railings. These 'magical' things are artist renditions of the super-normal abilities that can be developed through years of practice.</Review>
            <Review>Wong's touch remains deft, his whims trustworthy, and his indulgence is still carried over from the screen and becomes our own.</Review>
            <Review>Eventually, the story becomes as much an atmospheric lament about what has been lost, as it is a kinetic celebration of how kung fu adapted to the changing times.</Review>
            <Review>The narrative structure is a little shaky at times, and it perhaps inhabits too many genres to be fully successful in any of them, but my goodness it's compelling.</Review>

            <Review>Director Richard Robbins delights in dotting his screen with bursts of color, from a shimmering orange dress to the deep purple of a pen cap, while the stories, shaped by anecdotal brevity, are often charmingly modest.</Review>
            <Review>'Advocacy Cinema' has found a new, strong standard-bearer in Girl Rising; one hopes it drives the forceful change needed in our global community as powerfully as it represents a creative shift in the genre.</Review>
            <Review>While some of the films are more successful than others, they all show the power of engagement and education, of looking at the world and its problems, as one story put it, in a way "that makes the achievable seem doable."</Review>

            <Review>In its own saintly manner, it's as exploitative as anything critics accused Django Unchained of being, minus Tarantino's eye for idiosyncrasy and sense of humor.</Review>
            <Review>The cumulative emotional effect is devastating: the final scenes are as angry, as memorable, as overwhelming as anything modern cinema has to offer.</Review>
            <Review>So overpowering is this film's simple, horrible, and almost entirely true story that it's hard to get enough distance on 12 Years a Slave to poke at its inner workings.</Review>
            <Review>Every scene of 12 Years a Slave, and almost every shot, conveys some penetrating truth about America's original sin.</Review>
            <Review>The power of McQueen's movie is in its declaratory style: This happened. That is all, and that is everything.</Review>
            <Review>12 Years a Slave is more of an important film than a great one.</Review>
            <Review>Movies can do a great many things - they can make us laugh, or incite our heroism, or frighten us, or make us cry. '12 Years a Slave' makes us feel, deeply and urgently.</Review>

        <Title>The Iran Job</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>90</Duration>
        <StoryLine>When American basketball player Kevin Sheppard accepts a job to play in one of the world's most feared countries - Iran - he expects the worst. But what he finds is a country brimming with generosity, acceptance, and sensuality. With a charismatic personality that charms everyone he meets, Kevin forms an unlikely friendship with three outspoken Iranian women who share with him their strong opinions on everything, from politics to religion to gender roles. Kevin's season in Iran eventually culminates in something much bigger than basketball: the uprising and subsequent suppression of Iran's reformist Green Movement - a powerful prelude to the sweeping changes currently unfolding across the Middle East in the wake of the Arab Spring.

            <Review>A lively, engaging documentary directed by the German filmmaker Till Schauder ...</Review>
            <Review>The film takes a distinctly American approach to Iranian matters of gender relations and religious extremism, shedding little light on subjects that are far more complicated than Schauder makes them out to be.</Review>
            <Review>I confess to being a sucker for sports movies, the ones with the "Big Game" at the end. "The Iran Job" has all the requisite elements of that cinematic subgenre, but strives for something deeper.</Review>
            <Review>This observant documentary avoids pedagogy; it's not always artful, but it has a relaxed, light touch that never topples into pretension.</Review>
            <Review>The sports drama gives The Iran Job a strong hook, while the cultural context enriches the movie's real story, which is less about Sheppard's life in Iran than about the people he meets.</Review>
            <Review>This is a complicated, accessible and heartfelt human drama, one that Obama, Romney and Americans of all political stripes should see ...</Review>
            <Review>A film that despite its modest means tells a stirring tale about sports and politics. Starring Kevin Sheppard, a completely winning personality and basketball player.</Review>
            <Review>An honest and open portrait of work, friendships and relationships in a troubled and lively nation blessed with a vibrant culture and cursed with an oppressive religious regime.</Review>
            <Review>If you invest in Kevin Sheppard's story, it will pay off.</Review>
            <Review>As an entry into the Iranian world, Schauder and Nodjoumi made a wise choice with sports, but they made an even better choice with Sheppard.</Review>
            <Review>This lively documentary breaks no new ground cinematically, yet its mix of discovery and befuddlement should bring more than sports fans to a basketball story.</Review>
            <Review>The Iran Job locates an absorbing, cross-cultural universality with surprising ease.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Before sunrise on August 29, 2005, Nolan Hayes (PAUL WALKER) arrives at a New Orleans hospital with his pregnant wife, Abigail (GENESIS RODRIGUEZ), who has gone into early labor. What should be one of the happiest days of Nolan's life quickly spirals out of control when the birth goes tragically wrong and Hurricane Katrina ravages the hospital, forcing an evacuation. Told to stay with his child, who is on a ventilator, and await transfer by ambulance, Nolan and his newborn are soon cut off from the world by power outages and rising floodwaters. When no one returns to help, Nolan faces one life-and-death decision after another, fighting to keep his daughter alive, as minute-by-agonizing minute passes...becoming unimaginable hours.

            <Review>Walker's performance - along with the film - gets more and more engrossing.</Review>
            <Review>While uneven, the film is uniquely involving - right down to a final shot that will break your heart into a million pieces.</Review>
            <Review>For those who wish to see [Walker] at his best, "Hours" is worth the time.</Review>
            <Review>Hurricane Katrina has already been pretty thoroughly mined for documentaries and fictional stories, but "Hours" holds your interest nonetheless.</Review>
            <Review>Most of the movie elicits tense empathy, which builds to a genuinely nerve-wracking sense of dread.</Review>
            <Review>Take away the on-the-nose title and some half-hearted stabs at symbolism, and what's left is a B-thriller of the "they don't make 'em like they used to" variety.</Review>
            <Review>Taking place over the course of two hopeless days, Walker's performance is truly special.</Review>
            <Review>Could've marked a turning point in Paul Walker's career to more interesting and demanding projects post-age-40.</Review>
            <Review>A lean, palpably tense thriller. Paul Walker gives the best performance of his career.</Review>
            <Review>As one of the last completed roles by [Paul Walker]...it feels nice to be able to luxuriate in the actor's presence. In another set of circumstances, Hours could have proved to other filmmakers what the actor was capable of</Review>
            <Review>The chemistry Walker shares with Rodriguez is terrific as the two played off of each other perfectly.</Review>
            <Review>Called upon to carry almost the entire movie by himself, Walker has a tough time mustering genuine emotion, although he does better in the few legitimately tense scenes.</Review>

            <Review>Alas, the film quickly loses its offbeat charm and devolves into a routine monster movie.</Review>
            <Review>Appealing as that might sound to the walking-dead obsessed, this modest, low-budget sci-fi thriller is fatally lacking in entertainment value.</Review>
            <Review>In the ways that "The Last Days on Mars" is like a horror movies, it's typical, and in the ways it's different, it's mostly flat.</Review>

            <Review>The acting is convincing across the board, especially Schrieber's, despite being saddled with such dialogue inanities as saying "you're gonna be all right" to a crewmate who is zombifying before his very eyes.</Review>
            <Review>Old fashioned, straightforward, entertaining sci-fi horror.</Review>
            <Review>From the get-go, Last Days on Mars looks like a film which the parties involved put about half their effort and care into.</Review>

            <Review>Everything is wrong with [Spike] Lee's version of Park Chan-wook's notorious, super-violent super-action-thriller. For one thing, it's far from super. Not the quality, per se (although, for Lee, that's off, too), but the energy.</Review>
            <Review>Why would we want to watch a chronicle of Joe's agonies, and the agonies he gets to inflict on others? Passing it up would be the best revenge.</Review>
            <Review>Hollywood's wildest cinematic freakout since "Shutter Island" is a remake of-and an improvement on-the Korean original, from 2003.</Review>
            <Review>A vivid yet academic remake, this Oldboy is shorter, leaner and lesser.</Review>
            <Review>Sometimes I don't understand the Hollywood mindset. Who thought remaking Park Chan-wook's 2003 cult classic, Oldboy, was a good idea?</Review>
            <Review>Much of the dialogue is stilted (several scene are laughable) and the melodrama feels unmoored without the lurid, baroque atmosphere of Park's film -- which, after all, was kind of the whole point.</Review>
            <Review>Lee's remake will strike a cord with unfamiliar audiences, but, for the most part, it's a hit-and-miss effort that comes close to good results.</Review>
            <Review>The first hour or so of Lee's 'Oldboy' is so gripping that it's dispiriting to watch the wheels fall off the wagon so spectacularly in the third act.</Review>
            <Review>It's captivating to watch Spike Lee dabble in genre filmmaking.</Review>
            <Review>Compared directly, the difference between both films are more than a little disappointing, but with all of that said, 2013's Oldboy still has pleasures to be witnessed.</Review>
            <Review>Lee takes his time crafting fiery characters and an impenetrable, who-and-why mystery only to rush through a series of arbitrary clues and explanations.</Review>
            <Review>For a "pointless" and "unnecessary" remake, there's actually some really solid stuff in this one.</Review>

        <Duration>108</Duration>
        <StoryLine>In the dawn of '70s American blockbusters, European production companies emerged stateside, attempting to recreate box office gold by cloning Hollywood. The infamous Supreme Court-banned Jaws copy Great White, The Exorcist-esque Beyond The Door, and countless otherswere packaged for export and the burgeoning drive-in circuit. Producer Ovidio G. Assonitis and Director/Professional Body Builder Michael J. Paradise's TheVisitorstands as perhaps the most ambitious of all, taking its inspiration by artfully fusing The Omen, Close Encounters Of The Third Kind, The Birds, Rosemary's Baby, The Fury and Star Wars alongside a baffling cast that includes Shelley Winters (NightOfTheHunter), Glenn Ford (Superman), Lance Henriksen (Aliens), Franco Nero (Django) and Sam Peckinpah (director of TheWildBunch).

            <Review>It's far from the cerebral fare it was meant to be, but for fans of foreign knock-offs and impressively weird b-movies, The Visitor is a must-see.</Review>
            <Review>Never makes much sense even when it at times seems to make some sense.</Review>
            <Review>The movie suggests that contrary to Cassius' claim, the fault is not in ourselves but in our stars -- that, as the paranoid and psychotic have suspected, our unhappiness is the collateral damage of an eternal and cosmic struggle.</Review>
            <Review>Paradisi may not have a clue about directing actors... but he has picked up a few tricks from Argento on how to move a camera and from Fulci on how to stage a supernatural freak-out.</Review>
            <Review>The Visitor doesn't come close to answering all the questions it raises, but that's the film's M.O.: If nothing makes sense, then nothing is off limits.</Review>

Declan reaches beyond painting to wild experimentation, quickly spinning out of control. As he becomes consumed by his mania, he begins to regard his mother (Joey Lauren Adams) as part of a system that's keeping him down, and magnetically rallies the rebels to take part in his progressively subversive art exhibition--one that will ultimately shock and destroy.

            <Review>In its lesser moments, Blood Rush feels unfocused. Obviously this can be aimed at the number of characters it pays attention to, and the fact that, save for a few here or there, most of the side-stories aren't the most compelling.</Review>

Unfortunately for them, nonchalant best man Peter (Noel Clarke), bridesmaid Sarah (Mena Suvari) and an army of naysayers haven't heard they're meant to be together. Can missing bridesmaids, crashed cars, a trip to A&amp;E, and a delivery of pigs testicles stand in the way of true love</StoryLine>

            <Review>The Knot finds a bumbling groomsman fishing for silver wedding bands in a diarrhea-filled toilet bowl. Viewers searching for moments of wit or insight ... might relate.</Review>
            <Review>'The Knot' mostly plumps for the usual clichés and stereotypes.</Review>
            <Review>Clearly intent on being a British Hangover/Bridesmaids hybrid, this comedy romp doesn't contain a single laugh. It doesn't help that all of the characters are deeply unlikeable, or that the humour is literally centred in the toilet.</Review>
            <Review>An offensive anthology of every loud, lewd and loathsome wedding joke staged or screened between The Taming of the Shrew and The Hangover.</Review>
            <Review>If you can ignore the ill-judged slapstick and daft plot developments, it makes for diverting enough entertainment.</Review>
            <Review>The Knot is the wedding movie to end all wedding movies - because if this isn't the end of a trend, heaven help us.</Review>
            <Review>Bridesmaids, The Hangover and countless others have adequately covered the same territory and The Knot feels like a poor, cartoon-like imitation.</Review>
            <Review>Almost everything is reduced to gross-out moments that are about as funny as a yak's poo so that when love conquers all in the end you don't believe it for a moment.</Review>
            <Review>I would have happily jilted The Knot at the altar.</Review>
            <Review>All the film-makers do is show us things that raised a laugh in other movies - a bride with diarrhoea, lads vomiting, a little girl emitting obscenities.</Review>
            <Review>There are some gross-out toilet moments that I suspect are inspired by the recent US hit Bridesmaids, but that movie had laughs and a lot of heart. The Knot, sadly, has neither.</Review>
            <Review>Has the slapdash, half-finished quality of a high-school play, or perhaps a home video in which everyone involved is convinced that what they are creating is hilarious. In fact, it is not only unfunny and tedious but also hugely unpleasant.</Review>

            <Review>Too bad that Salinger offers no real insight into the elusive writer and is fueled almost entirely by trivial anecdotes.</Review>
            <Review>The movie has a shallow, paparazzo literalism. It just wants to catch the legendarily reclusive Salinger getting into a Jeep.</Review>
            <Review>What emerges is a portrait of an enigma.</Review>
            <Review>Where Salinger succeeds is in the gripping section on World War II, and in the exquisite, often melancholy details in the stories told by the likes of Joyce Maynard.</Review>
            <Review>The treatment of J.D. Salinger's writing in this overwrought documentary is so inflated and pompous it comes as a relief when Judd Apatow shows up to describe The Catcher in the Rye as a funny book filled with great lines.</Review>
            <Review>Salinger would scoff at it.</Review>
            <Review>For those captivated by Salinger's writing, this intelligent and often invigorating film provides fine insight into his world.</Review>

            <Review>Never mind that several characters seem to gain or lose British accents throughout the course of the film. The lack of continuity only enhances the sense of deliciously dizzying disequilibrium.</Review>
            <Review>As philosophy, Mr. Nobody seems sillier than it is profound. But in a parallel reality, more movies would have this degree of insane ambition.</Review>
            <Review>This big-budget English-language co-production shows that Europeans can compete in the sci-fi realm where high production values are king.</Review>
            <Review>With the film's maddening circular structure and often thudding visual expositions, the experience of watching it isn't quite as enjoyable as a description might augur.</Review>
            <Review>While Mr. Nobody contains some truly moving scenes, it eventually starts to try your concentration when you suspect all the space/time continuum shuffling may never become more than the sum of its parts.</Review>
            <Review>A film that has a beating heart underneath its messy -- though breathtakingly designed -- exterior.</Review>
            <Review>[Writer-director] Van Dormael seems unsure of what exactly it is he's trying to say, and thus Mr. Nobody rambles on for nearly two and a half hours.</Review>
            <Review>There are times when the film is entirely lucid in the points it wants to get across on love and the various choices we have to make throughout our lives, while at other times it seems lost in its overabundance of possibilities.</Review>
            <Review>Complex, visually stunning, and pleasantly convoluted, this is a film that seems like it can't be confined to one genre and while time flows in one continuous direction Mr. Nobody makes it a point to constantly pedal in the opposite direction.</Review>
            <Review>Too clinical to have an emotional impact, not romantic enough to engage a standard audience, and not smart enough for viewers looking for an intellectual experience.</Review>
            <Review>ambitious as all get out and a wonder from start to finish.</Review>
            <Review>While visual excess and occasional thematic bombast softens Mr. Nobody at times, the film nevertheless has poignant, often profound things to say about fate, mortality, consequence and love.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate/>
        <Duration>46</Duration>
        <StoryLine>In 1959, a government employee named Richard Oyler, living in the tiny desert town of Lone Pine, California, asked world-famous modern architect Richard Neutra to design his modest family home. To Oyler's surprise, Neutra agreed. Thus began an unlikely friendship that led to the design and construction of an iconic mid-century modern masterpiece. Considered the "father of California Modern Architecture," Time Magazine put Richard Neutra on their cover in 1949, ranking him second only to Frank Lloyd Wright among America's greatest architects. The Oyler House: Richard Neutra's Desert Retreat explores how Neutra came to befriend this modest, small-town family, and how he was inspired by the site's stunning desert setting, which Neutra compared to the grandness of the mystical Gobi Desert. Now owned by the actress Kelly Lynch and her writer-producer husband Mitch Glazer, the post &amp; beam-style home and its exotic surroundings shine through beautiful cinematography, and the story comes to life through interviews with Richard Oyler, Kelly Lynch, Neutra's sons, and well-known Los Angeles real estate agent Crosby Doe, who has represented homes by some of history's greatest modern architects.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Mystery lovers will delight in the sophisticated murder scheme, oenophiles will love the Wine Expo atmosphere, and admirers of restrained menace will lose themselves in the icy pools of Arestrup's eyes.</Review>
            <Review>How much you enjoy "You Will Be My Son" depends on how much you can take an unbearable, arrogant jerk as your lead character.</Review>
            <Review>Gilles Legrand's draggy melodrama about miserable characters who persist in their folly and never wise up is strictly vin ordinaire.</Review>
            <Review>French director and co-writer Gilles Legrand shows great mastery of tone and pacing in his third feature, which begins life as a domestic drama set at a family-owned vineyard and slowly morphs into a tense thriller.</Review>
            <Review>A strongly acted, character-driven melodrama, concerned with the dynamics of family in general and father-son issues in particular, it presents situations so emotionally supercharged that the whole story could have come straight out of Balzac.</Review>
            <Review>It's an entertaining melodrama of the old school that plays out with the clockwork inevitability of a "Columbo" episode.</Review>
            <Review>It's both an entertaining drama and a snappy little postcard of France.</Review>
            <Review>Headed by a pungent patriarchal performance by Arestrup. . . in beautiful vineyards. . .how far ambition trumps family ties is unpredictable. . .into a tense tale of revenge.</Review>
            <Review>Everything is explicit; no one makes an unexpected move.</Review>
            <Review>Legrand pays homage to this talent by packaging him with a fine script, a strong supporting cast and a rich production that make this fraught wine world both thrilling and chilling.</Review>
            <Review>The tyranny of fatherhood doesn't have a more intimidating embodiment than Niels Arestrup.</Review>
            <Review>For all of the director's willingness to explore his characters' unexpected depths, he's still hamstrung by his perpetually tasteful cinema-of-quality aesthetic.</Review>

            <Review>Though hardly a must-see, Thor: The Dark World is better than the original: a looser, loopier hybrid of science fiction and fantasy powered by a pair of magnetic performances and leavened with a number of truly witty moments.</Review>
            <Review>When Thor: The Dark World doesn't work-and it doesn't, far too frequently-it's when the writers and director take the whole thing much too seriously.</Review>
            <Review>While Thor's journey may be the weakest of the Avengers' tales - this entry nevertheless improving upon the first - it remains essential to the context of the whole.</Review>
            <Review>Save for Hiddleston's too-brief supporting turn, this is mighty forgettable stuff, a by-the-numbers sequel to what was already the slightest and least entertaining of the 'Avengers' components.</Review>
            <Review>An astoundingly sleek sequel that delivers a steady stream of both rousing action and substantial laughs.</Review>
            <Review>There's more action this time around, and less deliberate manipulation of the Marvel universe. The result is a film that flows better and gives the characters a little more room to be themselves.</Review>

            <Review>After watching "Narco Cultura," it's hard to imagine any "recreational" user of pot wondering whether the joint he or she just smoked isn't soaked in human blood.</Review>
            <Review>Narco Cultura is a wake-up call to anyone who doesn't understand the genesis of corrido music.</Review>
            <Review>However you come at it, it seems that the perpetual slaughter south of the border is an American export product, paid for and fine-tuned by American self-indulgence.</Review>

            <Review>Half of this film is a great, unforgettable look at the bloodiest battle ground in the War on Drugs. The other half is a muddled, almost pointless exploration of a subject that has very little to do with the great half.</Review>
            <Review>[A]t times, his aesthetic is so strong that you forget the gruesome images are real and not the product of some Hollywood film.</Review>
            <Review>Right out of the headlines, "Narco Cultura" is a documentary that offers insights into the world of drugs and music, north and south of the U.S.-Mexico border.</Review>

            <Review>By our quote-unquote standards of contemporary comedy, it plays as uneven at best and often just flattens out for long jokeless stretches.</Review>
            <Review>Runs through its clichés reliably enough.</Review>
            <Review>This film races with such high energy that the humor continues to satisfy, if only because the characters are so likeable.</Review>
            <Review>The film is perhaps a more effective tourism poster for Thailand than our official campaigns; the mix of beauty and quirk is just right, almost bland, certainly not offensive or critical. A sequel is in the pipeline _ it's win-win, at least for now.</Review>
            <Review>The slapstick humour in Lost In Thailand is hardly vicious but occasionally very effective.</Review>

        <Title>Twice Born</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>124</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Italian actor/director Sergio Castellitto takes the helm for this romantic war drama concerning a mother who finds her memories of a tragic romance stirred during a trip to Sarajevo with her teenage son. The year was 1984. With the Winter Olympics fast approaching, Gemma (Pen�lope Cruz) was in Bosnia when she fell in love with dashing American photographer Diego (Emile Hirsch). Their passions burned bright during their brief time together, but shortly after Gemma voiced her desire to become a mother, civil war erupted and plunged the country -- and their romance -- into chaos. Flash forward to present day, when Gemma receives word that an exhibition of Diego's photographs is about to go on display in Sarajevo. Still very much haunted by her complex and difficult past, Gemma boards a plane bound for Sarajevo with her teenage son. The moment she steps off the plane, the memories come rushing back. Later, as Gemma escorts her son around the city sharing stories from her youth, everything she sees seems to stir vivid memories of that ill-fated love affair, and the many ways that the harrowing experience shaped her into the person she is today. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>It's debatable whether the best love stories are also the "weirdest," as Emile Hirsch's character declares in "Twice Born." But they do require chemistry, the missing piece in his pairing with Penélope Cruz.</Review>
            <Review>Sergio Castellitto's film projects a tumultuous love story against the backdrop of the Bosnian War for independence, and then seems unaware that the foreground overshadows it in the worst possible way.</Review>
            <Review>"Twice Born" chokes to death on its own melodrama.</Review>
            <Review>A magnificent performance from Penelope Cruz.</Review>
            <Review>Yes, it's all as clunky and tasteless as the description suggests, and the awkward casting doesn't improve this overlong drama.</Review>
            <Review>One odd movie, from the casting of its leads to its backdrop to its final twist.</Review>
            <Review>Twice Born wants so desperately to be taken seriously that it creates an unnecessarily complex narrative, void of any chemistry-building moments for its romantic leads.</Review>
            <Review>The type of cinematic slog one watches and thinks, 'This would actually be much more interesting as a book.' And that makes sense, really, since that's its original medium.</Review>
            <Review>Sergio Castellitto's film quickly turns out to be more interested in reveling in the secrets of its storyline than in its sentiments.</Review>
            <Review>This European production is thoroughly cheesy and phony, nowhere less so than in its florid, undeliverable dialogue, which sounds like it's been translated, poorly, from various languages into English.</Review>
            <Review>Castellitto clings to the Duraflame fires within for Twice Born, a handsomely crafted but empty feature hoping to recreate Eastern European horror and soap opera intimacy.</Review>
            <Review>When setting a love story in a war-torn environment, it's nice to actually recognize the who, what and why of the conflict.</Review>

            <Review>Even casual music fans will enjoy behind-the-hits doc.</Review>
            <Review>Greg Camalier's debut feature offers a worthy if sometimes ponderous take on a significant slice of U.S. popular music history.</Review>
            <Review>Camalier's tuneful if somewhat overlong anecdotal history does the most justice to the Muscle Shoals sound just by listening to it.</Review>
            <Review>Retrospective rockumentary deconstructs the secret of a legendary Alabama music studio's success.</Review>
            <Review>It is amazing to see how this style and sound came to fruition as it changed the careers of artists like Aretha Franklin and created some of the most memorable albums and songs from artists like Etta James, The Rolling Stones, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and [more].</Review>
            <Review>Camalier makes an excellent job of combining talking-head interviews with music, anecdotes and folklore.</Review>
            <Review>An extraordinary story of singers, songwriters, musicians, producers and, most of all, two recording studios in a small Southern city.</Review>

            <Review>Dern's line delivery alone - all of his lines are delivered as if he was just awakened from a deep sleep, a flashlight thrust in his face - is worth the price of admission,</Review>

            <Review>Believe the hype: Gravity is as jaw-droppingly spectacular as you've heard - magnificent from a technical perspective but also a marvel of controlled acting and precise tone.</Review>
            <Review>Unfolding as a series of terrifying object lessons in Newtonian physics, the movie lends new meaning to the phrase "spatial geometry."</Review>
            <Review>Gravity is not a film of ideas, like Kubrick's techno-mystical 2001, but it's an overwhelming physical experience -- a challenge to the senses that engages every kind of dread.</Review>
            <Review>Nerve-racking, sentimental and thrilling, Gravity honors terra firma even as it reaches for the stars with Sandra Bullock and George Clooney.</Review>
            <Review>Cuarón and his cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki, keep the audience in weightless suspension right along with the astronauts. For most of us, Gravity is the closest we will ever get to the real deal.</Review>
            <Review>Gravity, a weightless ballet and a cold-sweat nightmare, intimates mystery and profundity, with that mixture of beauty and terror that the Romantics called the sublime.</Review>
            <Review>Gravity is less a feature film than cinema as experience: a new frontier in filmmaking that will appeal to studios trying to attract people to movie theaters.</Review>
            <Review>It's the very definition of a thriller, from the mysterious locale to the unpredictably tumultuous events containing no hope of survival.</Review>
            <Review>It is a big, bold picture that refuses to be timid, and it left me trembling. It's not just a film; it's something that happens to you.</Review>
            <Review>It is exhilarating film-making, engineered with dizzying invention, and it combines commanding 3D digital effects -- some of the best I've ever seen -- with a surprisingly soulful touch.</Review>
            <Review>Gravity becomes a character study driven by a riveting central performance and a radical thrill ride delivered with near real-time urgency which thrusts you through its implausibilities.</Review>
            <Review>Beautiful and poetic, the image of small humans in fathomless space is also elegiac and eventually frightening.</Review>

            <Review>All things considered - micro-budget, unknown actors, no real special effects, the point of view of a single video camera - "Amber Alert" proves a resourceful little thriller.</Review>
            <Review>If the sound of child being molested and moronic lead characters endlessly bickering is your thing, perhaps the feature won't feel like swallowing glass for 70 minutes.</Review>
            <Review>We've seen ghosts and Blair witches and demons and zombies in this growing "found footage" genre. But Amber Alert brings a little something new to the form - the urgency of pursuit, risks with real-world consequences.</Review>
            <Review>There is, perhaps, a smart film to be made on the same frightening subject. This isn't it.</Review>

        <Duration>91</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Prolific Cork-based documentarian Pat Collins possesses a restless curiosity, coupled with a poetic eye for the small moments - something that informs this feature debut, of sorts. We say 'of sorts' because Silence boldly defies categorisation at every turn. The film has been described as both meditation and odyssey, tracing the psycho-geographical journey undertaken by an enigmatic soundman (writer and co-scenarist Eoghan Mac Giolla Bhr�de) from his adopted city of Berlin to his native Donegal. His undertaking is to aurally document landscapes free from man-made noise - a journey that ultimately leads our protagonist inwards, as he finds himself drawn to his childhood home.</StoryLine>

            <Review>An uneasy mixture of fact and fiction ...</Review>
            <Review>It's a film in which the mere arrival of birdsong on the soundtrack is as a narrative event but there are rewards for the patient; even those easily bored should leave the cinema feeling soothed.</Review>
            <Review>Anyone caught trying to smuggle in popcorn should obviously be taken outside and shot - using a noise suppressor, preferably.</Review>
            <Review>Think of Brian De Palma's Blow Out, then imagine it re-filmed by a team of Trappist monks.</Review>

            <Review>An immersive and creative appreciation of the Irish landscape, culture and language as shown by sound recordings of environments untouched by man-made noise, archive footage and frank dinner table discussion.</Review>
            <Review>Even if filmmakers have trodden similar paths on other parts of the planet - Iran, for instance - and though a little patience is required, Collins draws you in with the suggestive power of hush.</Review>

            <Review>The dialogue is so vague, and the plot so minimal, it all feels like a rather pointless exercise.</Review>
            <Review>Questions mount and answers are slim, distracted by a score that veers from synth to symphonic.</Review>
            <Review>I could no more tell you what it's trying to say than I could successfully stow away on the first space shuttle to Saturn, although I promise you that trip would be half as long.</Review>
            <Review>We're stuck watching two normally interesting performers moodily flail about, trying to lend weight to an enterprise that revels in tedious art-house opacity.</Review>
            <Review>Gorgeous and haunting, inscrutable but rewarding of scrutiny, writer-director M. Blash's The Wait achieves the rare distinction of being warm and unsettling at the same time ...</Review>
            <Review>Visually, Blash does a excellent job portraying the character's quiet desperation, even if the symbolism sometimes verges on the obvious.</Review>
            <Review>When the climax finally arrives, it's a deliberate damp squib.</Review>
            <Review>Blash marshals considerable atmospheric forces, but his film collapses under the weight of oblique logic and plotting, lacking in either effective emotional payoff or the more skilled observational touch of a rumination on loss.</Review>
            <Review>By the end, audiences will most likely feel as if they've been locked out of the drama that's presumably unfolding right in front of them.</Review>
            <Review>Good cast, a promising premise, faintly chilling tone. But there's no payoff, here.</Review>
            <Review>Mysterious and oblique, like an expressionistic trip through the stages of grief toward discovering coping mechanisms.</Review>

        <StoryLine>A grizzled buck tracker attempts to save his junkie daughter from the wrath of a ruthless drug dealer by leading an ambitious New York City lawyer on a potentially-lucrative hunt in this bleak psychological thriller. A year after Joe Dawkins' wife died while he tracked a massive buck, he still blames himself for not being there to save her. Now, Joe's been hired by big city lawyer Greg to help him bag the buck that will win him a bet with the boss, and secure him a big promotion. But Greg is about as far from an outdoorsman as a man can get, and he's coerced his blue-collar brother-in-law Charles - an expectant father - into joining the hunt. On his way to meet Greg and Charles in the snowy woods of northern Maine, Joe stops off in a depressed mill town, where he finds his daughter Jenna in a shocking downward spiral of addiction. Even worse, Jenna is being threatened by Reggie, her sadistic drug dealer. Though Joe initially attempts to cancel the excursion in order to help his daughter, Greg makes him an offer that could settle Jenna's sizable debt to Reggie, and get him out of her life for good. Later, as the trio finds themselves on the trail of the same buck he was tracking when his wife died, the redemption that once seemed within reach appears to drift ever further away.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Aided by capable if unnecessary 3D effects, Petty displays a flair for staging violent action, but he's trapped inside a broad comic set-up that doesn't mesh with the story's innate meanness.</Review>
            <Review>Hellbenders doesn't take any risks, leaving the horror at too low a level and trying to get comedy from a situation where there isn't any, making this nothing more than a very forgettable film.</Review>

Rachel returns to the scene of the dance to get to know McKenna, and soon after, adopt her as a live-in nanny. This bold move unleashes unimagined and colorful waves of change into Rachel's life, marriage and community. (c) FilmArcade</StoryLine>

            <Review>The story doesn't hold together, but Hahn and Temple are terrific.</Review>
            <Review>The results are a little life lesson-y but well-observed.</Review>
            <Review>The entire film is good but the revelation here is Hahn, reliably one of the funniest women in Hollywood, now suddenly given a rich, complex and even sexy role.</Review>
            <Review>It's refreshing to hear dialogue that's natural and modern and doesn't try to pontificate. And the rewards are many.</Review>
            <Review>"Afternoon Delight" puts the typical suburban mother's lifestyle under an uncomfortably honest microscope, then documents the sporadically funny and occasionally sad results.</Review>
            <Review>Funny and trenchant, it isn't a shapely farce. It's a comedy of confusion that dares to be unlikable -- and somehow, that makes it more lovable.</Review>
            <Review>No longer the hilarious side role, Soloway gives Hahn an opportunity to star. She, in turn, proves ready and deserving of the challenge.</Review>
            <Review>...a decent drama that isn't, in the end, able to reach the heights that writer/director Jill Soloway is clearly aiming for.</Review>
            <Review>Mistaking smug self-awareness for satire, the film attempts to skewer yuppie privilege while accidentally wallowing in it.</Review>
            <Review>As Rachel enters her late-30s wilderness, Hahn only gets better.</Review>
            <Review>Kathryn Hahn is outstanding as the unraveling Rachel ... capable of significantly more depth than she's had the chance to display in her regular goofball comedy roles.</Review>
            <Review>Relaxed, intuitive performances from the top-notch ensemble cast pay dividends, with Hahn commandingly stressy in the central role, and Michaela Watkins impressively abrasive as neighbourhood organiser-in-chief.</Review>

            <Review>"On the Job" is a sturdy and sophisticated crime drama from the Philippines that takes a pretty gruesome situation and enriches its presentation with lots of human detail.</Review>
            <Review>Matti uses this setup to show the rot in Philippine society, and it's often compelling stuff - filmed mostly on dirty streets and in moldy, ramshackle buildings.</Review>
            <Review>Even at its most incomprehensible, the propulsive thriller "On the Job" is never less than arresting.</Review>
            <Review>Makes up in character development and action shots what it lacks in narrative innovation.</Review>
            <Review>Despite the relative flatness of [the] characters - their relationships to one another are more archetypal than particular - the film is as heartbreaking as it is heart-stopping.</Review>
            <Review>The film manages to create some moments of genuine nervous tension, but is undercut by its split storytelling.</Review>
            <Review>an audacious trawl through the gutter of Manila's political structures, evoking the very best conspiracy thrillers of the 70s while remaining utterly contemporary and local.</Review>
            <Review>This is a film whose signature image might be a bloody middle finger in the midst of a very lethal intersection shootout.</Review>
            <Review>A great premise, solid acting, and some really interesting shots from director Matti make this well worth watching.</Review>
            <Review>On The Job is a chance to see the original, messy thing.</Review>
            <Review>Matti's primary order of business is regularly serving up tense, stylish action sequences, and he proves more adept choreographing those than sorting out the convolutions of his parallel plotlines.</Review>
            <Review>A nose-to-the-ground crime thriller that also doubles as a wide-ranging portrait of official corruption in the Philippines, On the Job has little trouble delivering the genre goods.</Review>

        <Duration>98</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Austin High is a coming of age film both for a very unique city deep in the heart of Texas, known for decades as a slacker town and the mecca for all things weird, and for a wacky cast of characters who have enjoyed its laid-back acceptance all their lives. Initially shaken by the threat of a citywide crackdown on marijuana, which escalates into a full-on 'War on Weird', Principal Samuel Wilson and the rest of the blazed faculty, students, and staff of Ladybird High School must all shake off their slacker demons and find the courage to stand up and fight before the city they love is stripped of its essence and turned into the next great American strip mall of beige consumerist comfort.</StoryLine>

        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>134</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Cultural theorist superstar Slavoj iek re-teams with director Sophie Fiennes (The Pervert's Guide to Cinema) for another wildly entertaining romp through the crossroads of cinema and philosophy. With infectious zeal and a voracious appetite for popular culture, iek literally goes inside some truly epochal movies, all the better to explore and expose how they reinforce prevailing ideologies. As the ideology that undergirds our cinematic fantasies is revealed, striking associations emerge: What hidden Catholic teachings lurk at the heart of The Sound of Music? What are the fascist political dimensions of Jaws? Taxi Driver, Zabriskie Point, The Searchers, The Dark Knight, John Carpenter's They Live ("one of the forgotten masterpieces of the Hollywood Left"), Titanic, Kinder Eggs, verit� news footage, Beethoven's "Ode to Joy" and propaganda epics from Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia all inform iek's stimulating, provocative and often hilarious psychoanalytic-cinematic rant.</StoryLine>

        <Title>The Bad Bunch</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 1976</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>82</Duration>
        <StoryLine>This early '70s effort from veteran exploitation director Greydon Clark attempts to create a more socially conscious variation on the blaxploitation genre, but devotes most of its time to thrills of the most lurid variety. The story begins with Jim (director and co-writer Clark), a liberal-minded white Vietnam vet witnessing the death of a black soldier. He returns home and attempts to deliver the fallen soldier's posthumous Purple Heart to the soldier's family. In the process, he angers Makimba(Tom) (Tom Johnigarn), an angry militant who was the soldier's brother. Jim and Makimba's paths continue to cross as the two deal with their problems: Jim struggles to decide whether he should settle down with the prim and proper Nancy (Jacqueline Cole) or live with the free-spirited Bobbie, and Makimba develops an ever-growing anger towards white society as he is hounded by racist white cops, Lt. Stans (Aldo Ray) and Sgt. Berry (Jock Mahoney). Tom is finally driven over the brink and takes action, resulting in a tragedy that changes both men's lives forever. Despite the serious nature of the story line, the film that resulted is an exploitative affair that takes every opportunity to titillate the audience with plenty of sex and violence. As a result, its attempts at social consciousness went ignored, but its salacious moments went over well with the drive-in crowd. Director Greydon Clark later revisited the blaxploitation genre with the even more exploitative Black Shampoo.</StoryLine>

Upon discovering there is a price on his head Charlie sets out to learn who signed his death warrant as police work to track down his would-be-killers. When all clues lead Charlie back to his childhood friend Tony Zakia, he is forced to consider the prospect that he may have been betrayed by one of his closest allies. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>As violent as this mob thriller is, it also has a terrific sense of its central characters, focussing on strong emotions and moral decisions. And even though it's overcomplicated, the result is a sleek and very classy.</Review>
            <Review>Without a compelling plot to hold our attention, this only amounts to an impressively bloody bullet-a-thon: 22 seems a very conservative estimate...</Review>
            <Review>An unremarkable French thriller that feels like a Seventies Charles Bronson effort.</Review>
            <Review>When the chief baddie both stutters and slaughters puppies, you know you're in trouble.</Review>

            <Review>Its many memorable characters, adrenalin-charged action sequences and heart-stopping car chases make for a guilty pleasure.</Review>
            <Review>22 Bullets is neatly acted, nicely made and boasts complex characters that have depth.</Review>
            <Review>An uneven stew of character development, violence and sub-Top Gear car chases. Disappointing.</Review>
            <Review>There are few surprises but the blood-spattered action is handled with aplomb and Reno manages to keep a straight face when obliged to deliver the occasional lecture on morality.</Review>
            <Review>In the end 22 Bullets fails to live up to its potential by descending into a series of 'hits' that, whilst they carry a perverse level of justice that is satisfying on one level, end up diluting the film's sense of character and pathos.</Review>

            <Review>While the movie includes enough details about the physiology, strategy and marketing of bike racing to satisfy some of our curiosity, other questions remain unanswered.</Review>
            <Review>The tale has plenty of resonance off the race course. As sportswriter Dan Coyle says in the film, "It's not a story about doping, it's a story about power."</Review>
            <Review>"The Armstrong Lie" simply offers up the Armstrong lie. Sorry, but we've all already heard that one.</Review>
            <Review>The Armstrong Lie is eye-opening and myth-shattering and more than a little depressing.</Review>
            <Review>Gibney gives the truth as full an airing as seems humanly possible, given that the subject is a world-class liar.</Review>
            <Review>The Armstrong Lie has several insightful moments but is most interesting in how it shows us a filmmaker usually committed to finding the absolute truth in his subjects, suffering when he comes across a story where lies and truth constantly intertwine.</Review>
            <Review>( ... ) a riveting, insider's view of the unravelling of one of the most extraordinary stories in the history of sports. Alex Gibney's two-hour movie races by in what feels like minutes.</Review>
            <Review>The Armstrong Lie is a very good sports documentary, but doesn't reach far enough to become one of the best nonfiction films of the year.</Review>
            <Review>[A]nother brilliant documentary from the ever-incisive Alex Gibney... not about cycling but the power of celebrity...</Review>
            <Review>The lie is the least of it in Gibney's personal documentary</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>100</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Life of a King is the unlikely true story of Eugene Brown and his one-man mission to give inner-city kids of Washington D.C. something he never had - a future. He discovered a multitude of life lessons through the game of chess during his 18-year incarceration for bank robbery. After his release and reentry into the workforce, Eugene developed and founded the Big Chair Chess Club to get kids off the streets and working towards lives they never believed they were capable of due to circumstances. From his daring introductory chess lessons to group of unruly high school students in detention to the development of the Club and the teens' first local chess competitions, this movie reveals his difficult, inspirational journey and how he changed the lives of a group of teens with no endgame.

            <Review>Solid performances-especially from star Cuba Gooding Jr.-elevate the film slightly above the familiar trappings of its genre.</Review>
            <Review>An effective, even heartwarming, tale of one man's commitment to teaching that playing by the rules is more important than winning.</Review>
            <Review>The furious energy with which Mr. Gooding stifles his own intensity becomes a fascinating subtext in what is otherwise a forgettable film.</Review>
            <Review>Gooding gives a strong performance, but viewers might be better off seeking out the...documentary Brooklyn Castle, which focuses on the championship chess team at an inner-city New York middle school.</Review>
            <Review>Even if the story is faithful to the way the events played out in real life - and the official description is that the picture is a "dramatic retelling" - Life of a King couldn't feel more formulaic.</Review>
            <Review>Sentimental, formulaic tale of an inspiring chess teacher.</Review>
            <Review>The result has a predictably wholesome and formulaic structure, yet is redeemed through solid performances from Gooding and the youngsters, and a heartfelt sincerity that rings true.</Review>
            <Review>Though ostensibly based on a true story, the film feels like it has been finessed, exaggerated, and beaten into formulaic fiction. It's a twisted parody of high school and mentoring whose achievements are entirely accidental.</Review>
            <Review>A Sunday school-style parable which makes very effective use of chess mastery as a metaphor for negotiating the perilous gauntlet of possible ghetto pitfalls.</Review>
            <Review>Unquestionably well-meaning, this tale of an ex-con who teaches some inner-city teens about discipline through chess treads incredibly familiar emotional terrain.</Review>
            <Review>Any potential flights of invention or creativity are subordinate to the plain and emphatic delivery of life lessons.</Review>
            <Review>Sentimental, somewhat predictable feel-good tale of saving lost kids through chess. Very well-acted.</Review>

        <Duration>88</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Based on the best-selling book by Bill O'Reilly and Martin Dugard, Killing Kennedy begins in 1959, at major turning points for both the future president and his assassin. John F. Kennedy (played by Emmy-award winner Rob Lowe) is in Washington, D.C., preparing to announce his presidential candidacy, while Lee Harvey Oswald finds himself in the U.S. embassy in Moscow, renouncing his U.S. citizenship. These two events start both men-one a member of one of the United States' most wealthy and powerful families, the other a disillusioned former Marine and Marxist-on a cataclysmic track that would alter the course of history. Throughout the film, we see their highs and lows, culminating in not one but two shocking deaths that stunned the nation. (c) National Geographic</StoryLine>

            <Review>Ginnifer Goodwin as Jackie and Michelle Trachtenberg as Oswald's wife acquit themselves well in this solidly watchable, quickly forgettable dramatic snapshot of indelible history.</Review>
            <Review>You won't come away from it with any new answers, but it's a useful reminder of why the drama of that day has transfixed Americans for half a century.</Review>
            <Review>The dialogue is painfully clumsy, and the pacing is pure Wikipedia.</Review>
            <Review>Killing Kennedy is subversive in a great way. The more the pathology of Oswald is developed...the more it resembles what propels many conspiracy theorists.</Review>
            <Review>Killing Kennedy easily could have been twice its length, the better to add both nuance and context. Instead it's a watchable film with many missing parts, a broadly drawn Classics Illustrated version of what happened and why.</Review>
            <Review>There's nothing terribly wrong with Killing Kennedy. We just don't need the splashes of Hollywood in a story we already know way too well.</Review>
            <Review>Might just be a little too sober. At times, it's almost as unbelievable as the throw-everything-against-the-wall story that Oliver Stone tells in JFK.</Review>
            <Review>While there's little surprise in how it unfurls, it will still reign as the best, most attractive re-enactment of the event on tis 50th anniversary - and there will still be a lot of them.</Review>
            <Review>Certainly a film shown during the anniversary of that sad time should make you feel something. This one doesn't.</Review>
            <Review>NatGeo really should have made Killing Kennedy a feature-length theatrical release, as the 95-minute run time makes the story feel too compressed.</Review>
            <Review>By now, the beats of the Kennedy story are familiar to even the most casual student of history.</Review>
            <Review>The pace and the performances carry the film.</Review>

        <StoryLine>An aspiring Berlin actress becomes a medical test subject to pay for acting school, and eventually gets swept-up in the Hollywood sex trade while struggling to realize her dreams of stardom. 25-year-old Ana had almost given up on becoming an actress until she realized she could pay her tuition by selling her body to science. But when things don't go quite as Ana planned, she throws caution to the wind and travels to Hollywood. She's convinced that her big break is just around the corner, but the longer she stays in the city, the more her morals are compromised. Later, by the time Ana has started prostituting herself for cash, her dreams of stardom begin to feel as distant the twinkling lights in the nighttime sky. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>It's filthy, nasty, sexy, absurd, appalling, and exhilarating, and it succeeds as a musky union of novelist Cormac McCarthy's bleakness and Ridley Scott's sense of chic.</Review>
            <Review>A great writer's pompous idea of pulp fiction, treated with stultifying seriousness by everyone else involved.</Review>
            <Review>Each scene serves as little more than an index card for the mechanistic plot, which Scott films in a glossy and fluid style befitting an industrial promotion for the movie's high-tech weaponry.</Review>
            <Review>The Counselor is the cumbersome end product of a high-minded writer trying to slum and a slick director aiming for cosmic depth.</Review>
            <Review>It's not so much a bad film as it is a disappointing one. A very disappointing one.</Review>
            <Review>It's like a mumblecore movie about a bunch of Sarah Lawrence philosophy majors, made by coked-up rich people for 100 bajillion dollars.</Review>
            <Review>A masterful film, one that succeeds in conveying the nature of a cold, uncaring cosmos with remorseless tenacity.</Review>
            <Review>For all its perceptible pleasures, one's left to ask how well-served any of its talents were in the first place.</Review>
            <Review>With the exception of Bardem's hilarity, Fassbender's plumbing the depths of great grief, and Pitt and Rubén Blade's gangster poetics, the word for the film overall is 'Meh.'</Review>
            <Review>[McCarthy] reminds us (with a particularly American sensibility) that this world is broken and tragic and not fair, and that pushing past that fact too fast is an error we can't afford to make, for the good of our souls.</Review>
            <Review>At least Bardem continues to make the case that he doesn't have a bad performance in him, even in a film as lackluster as this.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is full of odd one-on-one conversations that may exasperate those who want the film to get to the point, but the dialogue is the point.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>The acting throughout falls into two registers; pantomime mugging for most of the cast, while the romantic leads, Russell and Feild, look so ill at ease that you pity them.</Review>
            <Review>Austenland is modest fun but needs to show it has a brain under its sun bonnet.</Review>
            <Review>"Austenland" understands Austen's enduring romantic appeal but has no use for her deeper themes of class, wealth and gender inequality.</Review>
            <Review>It's tentative in its intentions and afraid to push all the way with its premise. It is not sharp enough as a comedy, and when it tries to shift gears and become a romance, it is unconvincing in its machinations.</Review>
            <Review>A mildly surprising and completely heartwarming ending casts a glow over the previous 96 minutes of "Austenland" but can't wipe out all regrets for what might have been.</Review>
            <Review>Everything rings false, and the spectacle of bad actors pretending to be bad actors may trouble your sleep for some time.</Review>
            <Review>It's probably unfair to compare the film and its source inspiration too heavily but this plays out like a weak modern-day Austen novel.</Review>
            <Review>Although...mostly a nice, light, little trifle, it's ultimately half a soufflé at best-one that never quite rises to the occasion.</Review>
            <Review>an interesting diversion that holds a lot of promise at first, is pleasant but generally underdelivers throughout, and then almost redeems itself with a last-minute twist that almost makes sense considering the movie's core weakness.</Review>
            <Review>Austenland is a pretty film to look at, but underneath its look, there's just not much there.</Review>
            <Review>Rom-com fanatics and Austen aficionados may find gems in Austenland, but others will see this as a film with little sense or sensibility.</Review>
            <Review>Based on the 2007 book by Shannon Hale, all the ingredients for a deft, sly, sleight-of-hand comedy are there. But the film is all over the place. The tone is off, the timing is off, the cutting is off. And it's just not funny.</Review>

        <Title>2 Jacks</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>90</Duration>
        <StoryLine>2 Jacks is a comical adaptation of Leo Tolstoy's short story Two Hussars, comparing the generational change from father to son within the same business. The fast-paced Hollywood lifestyle, with romance and glamor, comes alive in 2 Jacks; a now-and-then look at the renowned way of living. Legendary film director Jack Hussar (Danny Huston), notorious gambler and womanizer, returns to the LA scene to raise money for his next feature film. Back in LA, Jack walks himself into an eventful night. Doing what he does best, Jack seduces the stunning Diana (Sienna Miller), attends some wild industry parties, and narrowly escapes a brush with the law, all before playing a high-stakes poker game at dawn. As years pass, Jack Hussar Jr. (Jack Huston) later arrives in Hollywood to follow his father's career path for his directorial debut. Soon after arriving, Diana (now played by Jacqueline Bisset) notices her daughter falling for her former lover's son. Within this film we see the struggle of a son trying to step out of his father's Hollywood shadow.(c) Official Site</StoryLine>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>Bernard Rose's fourth ultra-low-budget Tolstoy adaptation suffers from a slack narrative and abysmal dialogue.</Review>
            <Review>Based very loosely on an early short story by Leo Tolstoy, "Two Jacks" has a much less interesting second act ...</Review>
            <Review>Unfortunately, these inconsistencies cause more confusion than the magic Rose is presumably going for.</Review>
            <Review>Playing these self-infatuated flimflammers, Danny and Jack Huston obviously know the drill. It's in their blood.</Review>
            <Review>Mostly, it makes you feel like the only sober person at a party you can't leave.</Review>
            <Review>Rose's apparent intent is to show how little of Hollywood's Golden Age magic is left today. In that, at least, he succeeds .</Review>
            <Review>Inconsistent yet reverential, it's a truly trivial pursuit.</Review>
            <Review>John Huston's shadow looms over the entire film, and as shadows go, it is long and very hard to get out from under.</Review>
            <Review>Granted, the Tolstoy story had the benefit of internal monologues that clarified motivations and impulses. But a good film finds ways of doing this through gesture, expression and other artful ways. This is not a good film.</Review>
            <Review>Like the earlier Huston/Tolstoy projects, Two Jacks is cheap-looking and rough around the edges, but there's a confidence about all these films too.</Review>
            <Review>The embarrassingly low production value of Bernard Rose's 2 Jacks works symbiotically with the film's botched performances.</Review>
            <Review>Rather thin but moderately entertaining.</Review>

            <Review>Remarkably, The Summit achieves some of the same dizzying impact as Gravity -- by philosophical and psychological means, rather than special effects.</Review>
            <Review>The subject is fascinating and the cinematic punch afforded by peaks so massive, inspiring with their terrible beauty is a filmmaker's dream.</Review>
            <Review>You have a tangled story being told by director Nick Ryan and writer Mark Monroe in a somewhat tangled way. The result isn't as much confusing as it is distracting.</Review>
            <Review>First-time director Nick Ryan isn't entirely up to the challenge in "The Summit," but he does deliver some dramatic and visual highs in the attempt.</Review>
            <Review>At once repetitive and puzzling. There is a lot of finger-pointing. Assertions are made, theories offered, but not much in the way of certainty.</Review>
            <Review>There's something unsettling about a real-life tragedy presented as an action film; that the filmmakers never acknowledge this is more unsettling yet.</Review>
            <Review>Structurally confused and suspect in its depiction of the events. Bad taste and poor decisions waylay any attempt at emotion.</Review>
            <Review>Visually impressive and well-researched, The Summit certainly stirs up the terror and mystery that attended that disastrous weekend.</Review>
            <Review>The Summit rises above the foothills of cliché to bring some existential oomph to the accident scene.</Review>
            <Review>The Summit picked up an editing prize at Sundance, which you can only surmise was awarded because the film does a fine job of leaving you as confused as the people on K2.</Review>
            <Review>It still works as a cautionary tale of man vs. nature hubris, but the endgame finger-pointing among survivors, their families, and one amazing Nepalese sherpa leaves the viewer frustrated.</Review>
            <Review>The seriousness of the climbers' predicaments overshadows practically every quibble with the story.</Review>

            <Review>The film can't find the woman beneath the façade, despite Watts' best efforts. Maybe she didn't exist. Or maybe there's a better movie to be made.</Review>
            <Review>It's ... a pity that her life is reduced to such a forgettable movie.</Review>
            <Review>This visually polished, Oscar-baiting docudrama chronicles her final two years, and even in death she's a subject of invasive speculation.</Review>
            <Review>If you are going to make a film about the late Princess of Wales, you are obviously going to choose the guy who directed "Downfall," about the last days of Hitler, and the actress who played opposite King Kong.</Review>
            <Review>An incredibly depressing re-make of Notting Hill.</Review>
            <Review>Sets the proceedings within a misty cloud of conjecture.</Review>
            <Review>By the time Diana goes gay-clubbing to the sounds of the Pet Shop Boys' 'West End Girls' I began assuming the filmmakers actively hated their subject.</Review>
            <Review>Yes, Diana is the poor little rich girl, but the opulent settings, private jets, yachts, and chauffeured cars prove peculiar and distracting affectations.</Review>
            <Review>This affair hardly plays as being more than the pre-Dodi Fayed footnote it still is today, much less deserving of this grand epic romance treatment given by the filmmakers.</Review>
            <Review>It may not be anything all that special, but it's harmless, well-made and entertaining on its own terms.</Review>

Grace Trey (AJ Michalka) has just turned 18 and aspires to do more than sing in her church's worship band, which is led by her father, Johnny Trey (James Denton), a one-time pop star who gave up his life in secular music when he became a Christian. Grace longs to escape his shadow and make a name for herself singing songs about something other than God, but Johnny warns her that fame is not as glamorous as it looks and reminds her that serving and worshipping God with the talent she's been given is a far more worthwhile goal.

        <StoryLine>DAYS IN SEPTEMBER, DONA FLOR AND HER TWO HUSBANDS) returns with a sophisticated tale of an unlikely romance between two extraordinary artists, set against the backdrop of political upheaval and a clash of cultures. Grappling with writer's block, legendary American poet Elizabeth Bishop (Miranda Otto) travels from New York City to Rio de Janeiro in the 1950s to visit her college friend, Mary (Tracy Middendorf). Hoping to find inspiration on Mary's sprawling estate, Elizabeth winds up with much more - a tempestuous relationship with Mary's bohemian partner, architect Lota de Macedo Soares (Gl�ria Pires), that rocks the staid writer to her foundation. Alcoholism, geographical distance and a military coup come between the lovers, but their intimate connection spans decades and forever impacts the life and work of these two extraordinary artists. The attraction of two polar-opposite women has rarely been so volatile and so erotically charged on the big screen.(c) Wolfe</StoryLine>

            <Review>I guess I've seen worse teen sex comedies, but it's rare to encounter one this stupid.</Review>
            <Review>It's a frothy satire about adolescent social manners, a bit like "Clueless" or a tongue-in-cheek take on the 1980s-'90s "Degrassi" television series.</Review>
            <Review>"G.B.F" works its concept to death as its silly story builds to a prom scene that revolves around a tepid, underwhelming homage to "Carrie."</Review>
            <Review>Director Darren Stein clearly has some serious themes in mind, even as most of his characters exhibit all the brain cells of amoebae.</Review>
            <Review>Offers an admirable message of tolerance for teen audiences - too bad it's been absurdly saddled with an R rating, even though there's far less innuendo than in "Easy A.''</Review>
            <Review>Extremely edgy comedy sends up gay best friend stereotypes.</Review>
            <Review>It's a light, fluffy concoction but one so playful and unpretentious that it's easy to like. This is the high school movie gay teens have been waiting for.</Review>
            <Review>When you reach the end of this title you feel rather exhausted, so maybe an entire season would be pushing it just that little bit too far.</Review>
            <Review>The result is mostly swishy, sweet fun, although admittedly it might have benefitted from a bit of tweaking to fluff up bigger, better, and bitchier one-liners.</Review>
            <Review>Chronic bubble-gum highschool farce in which gay characters are reduced to tokenistic social accessories.</Review>
            <Review>A colourful, hyperactive romp that, despite attempting to bust apart teen-flick clichés, quickly conforms to type.</Review>

            <Review>Even Redford bailing water for 106 minutes can be a bit much.</Review>
            <Review>This is an uncommonly absorbing movie.</Review>
            <Review>We get the predictable plot points - storms, sharks, close calls with passing ships - but it feels like a uniquely handmade artifact.</Review>
            <Review>All is Lost is a testament to a great actor, an experimental piece of cinema and a bit of a bore.</Review>
            <Review>All Is Lost is very much Redford's triumph. His turn isn't pure disappearance so much as a brilliantly human example of cresting and plummeting, cresting and plummeting.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is rigorous, serious and well-crafted, with Redford holding the screen using only his economical emotional reactions and physical presence.</Review>
            <Review>As grim and hopeless as things could possibly get in a movie called All Is Lost, the movie is essentially about perseverance: playing it smart, staying safe and not giving up until -- well, see the title.</Review>
            <Review>A vital, exciting piece of work from Mr. Redford, an actor whom you'd have been forgiven for counting out by now.</Review>
            <Review>The success of All Is Lost is to be a physical film that ends up with emotional reverberation, right down to the last shot that engulfs us and Our Man in the depths of the ocean, with only a faint light shining from above.</Review>
            <Review>Like Gravity, this actually offers the greatest story of them all: one person's fight to stay alive.</Review>
            <Review>All is Lost is outstanding and so the collaboration between Redford and writer/director J.C Chandor.</Review>
            <Review>Frank G. DeMarco and Peter Zuccarini, dual cinematographers, gather gorgeous imagery especially those captured from beneath the ocean's surface.</Review>

            <Review>Refreshingly free of digital apocalyptics and unnervingly prone to random violence.</Review>
            <Review>How I Live Now centres on what happens to a group of young people when civilization begins to crumble. But it's also a poignant love story, a compelling, against-all-odds one at that.</Review>
            <Review>"How I Live Now" makes World War III seem boring, which would hardly seem possible.</Review>
            <Review>There's a clear message here: Sometimes it takes extraordinary circumstances to realize it, but we all have the capacity to shed our petty concerns and focus on the greater good.</Review>
            <Review>How I Live Now offers adolescents a lovely vision of holistic healing in the same countryside.</Review>
            <Review>There's a lot left unsaid in How I Live Now - but it's unsaid with unusual force.</Review>
            <Review>Based on the YA novel by Meg Rosoff, How I Live Now finds itself hindered by its source material, even as it seeks to surpass it.</Review>
            <Review>Saoirse Ronan supplies what the screenwriters do not</Review>
            <Review>Lush and bewilderingly rich with portent and moment, Kevin Macdonald's gently wrought apocalyptic-pop teen romance takes place in a deadly near future in the English countryside far from the center of modern war.</Review>
            <Review>How I Live Now is likely to appeal to both teens and older viewers, and it thankfully doesn't blindly follow formulas, but allows itself to drift and flow.</Review>
            <Review>On the outside, How I Live Now looks like a mess. Part Tomorrow When the War Began, part The Shining, part 28 Days Later, it's a hodgepodge of concepts that don't completely gel. So it's weird that the film is actually quite good.</Review>

        <StoryLine>SPINNING PLATES is a documentary about three extraordinary restaurants and the incredible people who make them what they are. A cutting-edge restaurant named the seventh-best in the world whose chef must battle a life-threatening obstacle to pursue his passion. A 150-year-old family restaurant still standing only because of the unbreakable bond with its community. A fledgling Mexican restaurant whose owners are risking everything just to survive and provide for their young daughter. Their unforgettable stories of family, legacy, passion and survival come together to reveal how meaningful food can be, and the power it has to connect us to one another. (c) Film Arcade</StoryLine>

            <Review>Yet another smoothly produced doc for the foodie set.</Review>
            <Review>Plays to sentiment in its second half but you can't help but admire the tenacity of these people, who have been tested repeatedly in almost Biblical fashion, yet come out swinging.</Review>
            <Review>Though these stories have little to do with each other, all are gripping, and you watch the last third of "Spinning Plates" rapt.</Review>
            <Review>While the dramatic conflicts in the film are set up in a rather rote manner (meet the personalities, fret over their setbacks, sigh at the resolution), the human stories here are undeniably moving.</Review>
            <Review>The tales are worthwhile, but it's challenging to find a common thread among them that goes beyond vague generalities.</Review>
            <Review>The movie doesn't always feel cohesive, but the stories are unexpectedly touching.</Review>
            <Review>Spinning Plates has three moving personal stories, and that's what makes it memorable.</Review>
            <Review>Filmmaker Joseph Levy seems at ease infiltrating the communities that spring up within and around professional kitchens.</Review>
            <Review>Proves there are no exhausted topics, only skilled (or the obverse) storytellers.</Review>
            <Review>Rather than venerating the business of food, this documentary expertly points out that it is, indeed, a business and sometimes lives and livelihoods are at stake.</Review>
            <Review>What at first seemed like very separate experiences begin to merge. All the restaurateurs want to feed people and make them happy, and each puts a little of themselves into the effort.</Review>
            <Review>Has nothing to do with the noble - and undervalued - art of plate spinning. (I confess this disappointed me slightly.) No, it's just an oddly titled documentary about three restaurants.</Review>

            <Review>The result is thoroughly delightful. The reasons for its success lie in Disney's own unfettered animal spirits, his ability to be childlike without being childish.</Review>
            <Review>Smple, uncluttered, straight-forward fun.</Review>
            <Review>The standout song goes to Harris, a rhythmic 'Bare Necessities' extolling the value of a simple life and credited to Terry Gilkyson.</Review>
            <Review>A serious disappointment, recommended only for inveterate Disney fans and very young people.</Review>
            <Review>It's also got great knockabout visual gags, mercifully little cutey-poo sentiment, and reasonable songs.</Review>
            <Review>The period's feathery drawing style abounds, and an all-round warmth pervades.</Review>
            <Review>The plot and pacing may be nearly as lazy as the sloth bear Baloo (Phil Harris), but animators use that to their advantage, developing the characters so that even minor ones seem majorly entertaining.</Review>
            <Review>Here's yet another animated feature from Disney's mostly barren stretch between its two golden ages, a film that plays better in nostalgia-tinged memories than in the here-and-now.</Review>
            <Review>Disney's grandniece recently cast aspersions on the picture, but I don't share her pessimism.</Review>
            <Review>[Blu-ray Review] Looking and sounding like a million bucks (or more) and full of exhaustive bonus content new and vintage, the Blu-ray release of "The Jungle Book" is a must-own for anyone who loves animation, the Walt Disney studio, or film in general.</Review>
            <Review>Every one of the bunch is memorable, and each plays gracefully into the action of the film.</Review>

            <Review>Enough people attended Ender's Game last weekend to place it at the top of the box office. But could any of them have known how profoundly unspectacular an experience they were in for?</Review>
            <Review>While the picture loses some plot tension by assuring the viewer that Ender is basically an okay kid, it gains by showing the growth of the boy into his destiny as "the One."</Review>
            <Review>Straightforward, a bit literal-minded, very faithful to the book and largely compelling.</Review>
            <Review>If you dislike child actors, you might derive a perverse satisfaction from seeing dozens of them look so unhappy to be onscreen.</Review>
            <Review>There are times when a certain grimness weighs on the movie that you wish for more humor. But overall it's an absorbing and thought-provoking spectacle.</Review>
            <Review>Hard to comprehend and even harder to endure.</Review>
            <Review>A leaden, confusing affair that's all the more frustrating because there's a kernel of a good, possibly even great, movie here.</Review>
            <Review>Far too benign and, in this blockbuster season, far too tired to leave any bad taste in the mouth, Ender's Game is better the less one thinks about it.</Review>
            <Review>It takes itself a bit too seriously and would have benefited from twisting the entertainment dial a little higher, but it's refreshing to see a film filled with teens that's intelligent and reflective.</Review>
            <Review>Based on a hit novel by Orson Scott Card, this futurist sci-fi film trudges along in perpetual low gear, its efforts at times laboured, despite a no-nonsense turn by Asa Butterfield as the game-theorist boy of the title.</Review>
            <Review>Butterfield is excellent in the title role, several cuts above his fellow young cast members.</Review>
            <Review>It is its book, put on the screen without any new thought whatsoever. A seventh grader could watch it and write a passable essay about it. I doubt they'd have much fun with it, though.</Review>

            <Review>Strident, clumsy and pointless.</Review>
            <Review>It's another panto for 10-year-old girls, in which any given scene could - with only the addition of canned laughter - pass for something from children's television.</Review>
            <Review>The tone is broad, vulgar and exuberant and its hunt for lost treasure ends up inventively at the Globe Theatre. Schoolgirls and those who like ogling schoolgirls will enjoy it.</Review>
            <Review>A film that flails about wildly in search of at least one half-decent joke. Tragically, the closest it gets is having a dog hump Colin Firth's leg.</Review>
            <Review>This sub-Carry On romp wearily coasts along on the lines of a rudimentary old-school farce rather than anything resembling wit.</Review>
            <Review>This contrived sequel is an interminable, headache-inducing time-waster that never picks up any speed, weighed down as it is by far too many characters, and far too many slow-motion shots of the girls striding towards the camera.</Review>
            <Review>This jaw-droppingly hopeless sequel deserves to be packed off for a one-way exchange trip to Columbine.</Review>
            <Review>Oliver Parker and Barnaby Thompson do nothing here to destroy a winning formula which is cannily constructed to appeal to the target audience of teenage girls and nobody else.</Review>
            <Review>Cheap, ramshackle entertainment that's nevertheless imbued with affection.</Review>
            <Review>If there is a cinematic equivalent of a Christmas panto this season, it is surely St Trinian's 2, which is broad and ramshackle, cheap and gaudy.</Review>
            <Review>The piratical-treasure story is totally hokum, but it's all peppy, whiz-bang stuff livened up no end by Talulah Riley's fetching turn as Head Girl.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Christian O'Connell (Ivan Sergei) has met the girl of his dreams in Alison Marks (Jennifer Love Hewitt). Unfortunately, Christian told Alison (who happens to be a rabbi's daughter) that his name was Avi Rosenberg, and that he was Jewish- neither of which are true. Desperate to keep up the illusion, he turns to his childhood best friend, Adam Lipschitz (Joel David Moore) to teach him how to "act Jewish." But Adam has problems of his own, with a fianc� (Jamie-Lynn Sigler) pushing him closer to a mental breakdown as their wedding approaches. With the best intentions, Adam and Christian attempt to help each other out, but things quickly go completely and hilariously off the rails in this outrageous all-star comedy from the creators of the original hit international play seen by millions.(c) Variance</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>BOTTLED UP" (Olympus Pictures), a film starring Oscar (R)-winner Melissa Leo in a modern day drama in which she beautifully conveys the heart-wrenching struggle that comes with love and addiction, will make its debut as one of the high-profile titles unveiled by Evan Crooke's OSIRIS ENTERTAINMENT at this year's American Film Market, Nov 6 - 13, 2013. Director Enid Zentelis, nearly a decade after the success of her critically acclaimed "Evergreen," offers a stirring look into the debilitating effects of prescription drug abuse through the eyes of a talented cast with Leo as the protagonist faced with the difficult choice of living a life dictated by the daughter (played by Marin Ireland) she loves or beginning to live according to her own needs. Josh Hamilton also stars. (C) Osiris</StoryLine>

            <Review>A terminally quirky indie dramedy, "Bottled Up" risks trivializing prescription drug abuse in service of a trite middle-age romance.</Review>
            <Review>A small, intimate, bittersweet, and wonderfully crafted love story, it may very well add a spring to your step as you exit the theater.</Review>
            <Review>You watch "Bottled Up" feeling that the screenplay needed a few more drafts; the dialogue, in particular, doesn't always ring true.</Review>
            <Review>The intentions feel authentic, but not enough else does.</Review>
            <Review>Like Sylvie's wardrobe of oversized hoodies, the humor is loose and natural. It breaks up the tension of this addiction story with small, bright moments of pure joy.</Review>
            <Review>[a] bantamweight romantic comedy</Review>
            <Review>Writer/Director Enid Zentelis maximizes every dollar at her command, focusing her camera on a woman that many people-&amp; most men-would never look at twice... And she makes it clear that ignoring Fay-&amp; the Fays of this world-is their loss. Highly recommended!</Review>

        <StoryLine>50 % of the world's population lives in urban areas. By 2050 this will increase to 80%. Life in a mega city is both enchanting and problematic. Today we face peak oil, climate change, loneliness and severe health issues due to our way of life. But why? The Danish architect and professor Jan Gehl has studied human behavior in cities through 40 years. He has documented how modern cities repel human interaction, and argues that we can build cities in a way, which takes human needs for inclusion and intimacy into account.

            <Review>No documentary I've seen about city planning has come at the topic from such a resolutely humanistic perspective, or given me more hope for the future.</Review>
            <Review>The Human Scale presents interesting ideas but the format is often dull as concrete, more civics lecture than vibrant city life.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director Andreas M. Dalsgaard takes such a low-key approach to presenting the film's vital, potentially involving topic that viewers may find themselves more inspired to take a snooze than a stroll.</Review>
            <Review>If Dalsgaard's advocacy of Gehl's utopian vision largely ignores the socioeconomic forces arrayed against it, the film should nevertheless enthuse pedestrians, bike riders and public-space proponents everywhere.</Review>
            <Review>If the result sometimes feels like a sedate lecture, the global journey strongly enlivens the lesson; it's fascinating how alike and how different cities can be, and more fascinating to imagine what they may become.</Review>
            <Review>The Human Scale lacks both the punch needed to appeal to the layperson and the deep wonkiness to gain the attention of true geeks of the built environment.</Review>
            <Review>Dalsgaard has made a tight, compelling and well-designed film about design. That's harder to pull off than one might think.</Review>
            <Review>Gehl suggests we study people, not cars, and change our cities accordingly.</Review>
            <Review>Insightful and fascinating, but too dry and somewhat myopic.</Review>
            <Review>While there's no doubt that a city's walkability is important, the film would have benefitted from either stats or testimonials in favor of its central premise.</Review>
            <Review>Like many movies looking at the effects of globalization on the human condition, Dalsgaard looks at the ways today's cities are destroying our quality of life.</Review>

        <StoryLine>This stunning adaptation of Dickens' classic tale was captured live from the Vaudeville Theatre in the West End. Although Great Expectations has been adapted for film on two separate occasions, once by David Lean in 1946 and most recently by Mike Newell, it has never been produced for The West End or Broadway, widely believed to be too difficult to translate to stage. However, this Jo Clifford adaptation has been universally acclaimed as a triumph on its sellout tour of the UK head of its West End debut. In addition to the production, this version include red carpet arrivals from the February 7 premiere and behind the scenes footage exclusively for cinema audiences.</StoryLine>

            <Review>"The Banshee Chapter" is both elegant and terrifying.</Review>
            <Review>The central drama never fully engages, but the jolts that "Banshee" delivers are check-the-locks scary.</Review>
            <Review>A moody horror film from an immensely talented new director.</Review>
            <Review>The Banshee Chapter can't seem to decide if it wants to be a found-footage horror movie, or a more traditional one. To its detriment, it splits the difference.</Review>
            <Review>A smart, clever, and diverting little mash-up of numerous sci-fi and horror tropes.</Review>
            <Review>...just another run-of-the-mill low-budget horror effort.</Review>
            <Review>H.P. Lovecraft's From Beyond gets a 21st century revamp in Blair Erickson's solid first feature.</Review>
            <Review>The film avoids any real attempt at constructing scarily effective set-pieces in favour of having one of the unnamed entities pop screeching out of the dark whack-a-mole-style every few minutes.</Review>
            <Review>More unsettling than actually scary, this slow-burning horror movie is directed and acted with style even though the script feels rather under-developed.</Review>
            <Review>Not scary. And you can't have the non-found-footage part be as wobbly as the found-footage parts.</Review>
            <Review>Although no single strand within it can be called original, Banshee Chapter blends them flawlessly, delivering the most convincing piece of otherworldly horror for years.</Review>
            <Review>X-Files style horror movie based on MK-Ultra drug experiments. Ted Levine as a Hunter Thompson character is superb. On a budget, the film is a lot scarier than most of the more expensive "apparition" type movies showing up at the Cineplex.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate/>
        <Duration>90</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Drama telling the story of Hollywood's most glamorous couple, Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, who acted together for the last time in Noel Coward's Private Lives in 1983. When Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton met on the set of Cleopatra, the attraction was immediate. The public were enthralled by their illicit romance, two tempestuous marriages, frequent break-ups and extravagant reunions. They were the original fabulous stars, conspicuous in their consumption of clothes, houses, yachts, diamonds, and, more damagingly, alcohol. In 1976 Richard and Elizabeth divorced for the second time. They both married other people and it seemed that the romance of the century might truly be over. Then, in 1982, they both separated and were free again. In 1983, Richard and Elizabeth had one final reunion on the stage when they spent seven months touring with Noel Coward's Private Lives. During the tour public speculation grew about the possibility of another marriage, but in private old frictions played out once again. Speculation about another reunion ended when Richard Burton married his fianc�e Sally Hay halfway through the run. This is the story of the first celebrity 'it' couple. Beyond alcohol, pills and the trappings of fame, was love the ultimate crutch that allowed them to escape the realities of their extraordinary lives? Funny, glamorous, tempestuous and dripping with diamonds, this is the last battle of the Burtons. (c) BBC</StoryLine>

            <Review>Bonham Carter has a firm hand on a fundamental conflict within Taylor, which is that she seems like such an impossibly elegant, self-possessed woman at some moments and like such an infuriating flake at others.</Review>
            <Review>Bonham Carter offers up a sympathetic Liz who is in the process of squandering her talent; West makes Burton's brokenness seem like a noble resignation. And both seem surprised that each other's company is no longer the cure for what ails them.</Review>
            <Review>It's a film that asks a lot from West and Bonham Carter, who deliver time and again in roles that could have eaten them alive. Instead we feast.</Review>

            <Review>Burton and Taylor succeeds thanks to its truncated timeline and intimate feel.</Review>
            <Review>Unlike last year's miserable Liz &amp; Dick Lifetime biopic, BBC America's Burton and Taylor takes a more mature and artful approach - even the title is more respectful - with a giddy Helena Bonham Carter and a wearily dignified Dominic West</Review>
            <Review>Burton and Taylor delivered surprises and careful insights, and whether or not any of it was technically true (though I'm sure it was), it didn't matter. At the end of the day, as a story about two people we thought we knew, it worked.</Review>
            <Review>It's difficult to gauge how much fascination viewers still have for the couple, but Burton and Taylor is as good as it gets.</Review>
            <Review>Burton and Taylor distills the special pleasure those aging movie stars could still take in each other's company long after their passion was spent.</Review>

        <Duration>86</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Blood Brother is the story of a group of children infected with HIV and Rocky Braat, a disenchanted young American that met them while drifting through India. They were left on the doorstep of a slum orphanage by their families: he had bounced between parents and jobs his whole life. He wanted to adopt them all, but in reality, he couldn't cure even one of them. He had to stay. Today, he lives in a concrete hut a few hundred yards from the orphanage. Every day he encounters the bitter reality of HIV infection. People in the nearby village have tried to force the orphans out because they think the disease is communicable through touch. But the truth is-Rocky needs the kids as much as they need him. Every day they teach him what some of us will never really learn: love is the only thing that makes life worth living. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>In contrast to social-issue films filled with talking-head experts and bullet-point graphs, this is a portrait of a caregiver that goes to the core of motivation -- in this case, the need to share love.</Review>
            <Review>Blood Brother is about as well-meaning as a doc can be, yet its humanitarian message is often tainted by the ceaseless demands for attention stemming from the fragile ego of its subject, rootless young American Rocky Braat.</Review>

            <Review>Documentaries don't come any bigger-hearted than Blood Brother.</Review>
            <Review>A big part of Blood Brother's success lies in the personal connection between filmmaker and subject.</Review>
            <Review>A documentary with an originally structured first-person narrative. But it is still insufficiently directed, and some of what it omits makes it seem suspect.</Review>

            <Review>Braat is clearly adored by the children. "It took some time to train my mind" to see past their disease, he admits. But he's clearly found his home.</Review>
            <Review>In spite of his clear love and admiration for Braat, Hoover is also brave enough to consider the ethical questions that arise from any well-intentioned First Worlder's attempts to alleviate suffering on the other side of the planet.</Review>
            <Review>Blood Brother is an uneasy marriage between idealism and vanity.</Review>

            <Review>"Romeo and Juliet" is too soapy and improbable to count among the Bard's very best plays, but it surely has some of his best dialogue, and messing it up this much is close to inexcusable.</Review>
            <Review>There are reasons to see this Romeo and Juliet-it's just a shame that Romeo and Juliet are not chief among them.</Review>
            <Review>The grown-ups outshine the kids in this handsome, romantically anemic rendering of Shakespeare's perennial.</Review>
            <Review>What can you say about a Romeo and Juliet that lacks heat, romance, eroticism, or lyricism? Mercifully, not much.</Review>
            <Review>Juliet should be a girl, but the story's trajectory of self-sacrifice requires her to become a woman. Steinfeld gets the girl part exactly right, but she botches the transformation.</Review>
            <Review>Turning what should be a hanky-required tragedy into a headache-inducing travesty is no small feat.</Review>
            <Review>While the setting and the costumes are in keeping with the tale, you can't help but feel as if you are watching a grandiose stage production.</Review>
            <Review>A stuffy, old-fashioned production shot on distractingly spotless sets. It lumbers along in search of a reason to exist.</Review>
            <Review>Pretty but, ultimately, flat.</Review>
            <Review>Been a while since Shakespeare's star-crossed smoochers got some big-screen love. Going on the so-so outcome here, no one would have minded waiting a little longer.</Review>
            <Review>A sharply adapted version of the classic love story, stunningly visualised and tightly directed.</Review>
            <Review>Carlei's film is beautiful but sterile, and seems nervous its audience will be bored to the extent that there seem to be more sword fights than usual. Only Paul Giamatti's touching turn as the Friar stays in the mind when this passionless film is over.</Review>

        <Title>People Of A Feather</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>92</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Featuring stunning footage from seven winters in the Arctic, People of a Feather takes you through time into the world of the Inuit on the Belcher Islands in Canada's Hudson Bay. Connecting past, present and future is a unique relationship with the eider duck. Eider down, the warmest feather in the world, allows both Inuit and bird to survive harsh Arctic winters. Traditional life is juxtaposed with modern challenges as both Inuit and eiders confront changing sea ice and ocean currents disrupted by the massive hydroelectric dams powering New York and eastern North America. Inspired by Inuit ingenuity and the technology of a simple feather, the film is a call to action to implement energy solutions that work with nature. (c) First Run</StoryLine>

            <Review>Interweaving Inuit life today with re-enactments of the culture 100 years ago, "People of a Feather" warmly portrays a cold, uncertain present and a worrying future.</Review>
            <Review>Though the science behind this ecosystem change is clearly conveyed, Heath never puts together a larger narrative about the decline of Inuit culture and offers little political history of the situation.</Review>
            <Review>People of a Feather is best as a nature documentary, assembled from stunning footage of these fascinating creatures flying about the islands and diving into the Bay looking for food.</Review>
            <Review>An important documentary that will inspire you to help save Inuit communities and the sea ice ecosystems in Hudson Bay.</Review>
            <Review>Visually stunning and featuring the always engaging Inuits, the film hones in on the threats to the animals they rely on for survival but all of humanity. No man is an island...</Review>
            <Review>Another director might have focused narrowly on the hydroelectric industry, but...Heath takes a more measured approach. In the process, he portrays the people...with sensitivity and insight. Their lives are what give this documentary its real value.</Review>
            <Review>If you're down with down and give a damn about dams, this is your movie.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>80</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Recovering from an ill-fated affair with a married man, Gabe finds solace in the relationship he maintains with his ex-wife and daughter. On the other side of town, Ernesto evades life at home with his current live-in ex-boyfriend by spending much of his spare time in the hospital with an ailing past love. Impervious to the monotony of their blue-collar world, they maintain an unwavering yearning for romance. Far from the gay centers of the world, director Yen Tan explores the complex and oft-forgotten lives of gay men in small-town America. The understated, contemplative nature of Ernesto and Gabe's story is told from the perspective of an observer, allowing us-even if just for a moment-to understand what it means to be an outsider. The emotional isolation the two men have grown accustomed to is captured in a subtle, optimistic, poetic fashion while avoiding melodrama. In a refreshingly quiet film, Tan's protagonists never try to run away from their relatively hollow surroundings, but opt to fill life's deepest voids with their tenacious confidence. - TOBY BROOKS [Sundance Film Guide] (c) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>It's a touching film and a fascinating glimpse into one of those couples you can't quite believe are still together.</Review>
            <Review>A painful, powerful portrait of the struggle and sacrifice required to create, and the cost that it can demand.</Review>
            <Review>The story of an extraordinary marriage between two people bound together by their artistic impulse.</Review>
            <Review>A lively double portrait of Ushio and Noriko Shinohara, two Brooklyn-based artists who, after 40 years of marriage, are still creating side by side, and tormenting each other.</Review>
            <Review>More than anything, the film expresses - at an almost subconscious level - the difficulties of discerning not only what real art is, but also what true love is all about.</Review>
            <Review>Intriguing as their present lives may be, without enough background to appreciate, for instance, Ushio's associations with Rauschenberg and Warhol, we can't gauge the full extent of the couple's regrets and losses.</Review>
            <Review>Cutie and the Boxer is an often quiet, almost fragile piece of cinema that presents us with a spiky and unglamorous relationship, still full of love. It's a beautiful and humane documentary.</Review>
            <Review>An unexpected but fully welcome treat. It's a great look at how both relationships and the creative instinct evolve over a long time.</Review>
            <Review>[Heinzerling's] languorous explorations of the couple's chaotic home find the details of their sexual and intellectual intimacy in the debris of their relationship, the collected treasures and half finished, discarded fragments of ideas.</Review>
            <Review>A sly, subversive portrait of an artist finally finding her voice... and the 'genius' husband in whose shadow she has long lingered.</Review>
            <Review>The film (cough) paints a compelling portrait of a true eccentric with a vast gulf between his dreams and his powers.</Review>
            <Review>Noticed by Oscar voters, this offbeat documentary explores the life of two colourful artists who have an unusual marriage.</Review>

            <Review>After a while it's hard to take Dosunmu's barrage of off-center compositions ... dialogue sequences that have the actor converse with empty space, and close-ups that reduce faces and objects to blobs of light.</Review>
            <Review>It takes about 60 seconds before the elegant "Mother of George" has you firmly inside the world it has created.</Review>
            <Review>Serious cinema of the globalist sort.</Review>
            <Review>In the end, "George" becomes almost as irritating as that mother-in-law.</Review>
            <Review>It's a powerfully sensual movie, gorgeously lensed colors and textures conveying its characters emotional states while thoughtfully exploring the range of human sexuality through Adenike's experience.</Review>
            <Review>The whole cast is good, but the film wouldn't work without a great performance from Gurira, who is of Zimbabwean descent.</Review>
            <Review>Has the advantage of novelty and authenticity, but Dosunmu's ellipitical and self-consciously tasteful approach robs the material of some of its power...</Review>
            <Review>An engaging immigrant drama of the traditional Nigerian experience in NYC.</Review>
            <Review>There is a lot of wisdom in this film. There is strength in the old traditions, and error, too. In America, many people don't have these old traditions to guide them. They are something to hold onto, and that is a comfort.</Review>
            <Review>It's a beautiful and heartbreaking film.</Review>
            <Review>Just when it seems as if there are no new worlds for cinema to explore, a movie like "Mother of George" comes along to prove otherwise.</Review>
            <Review>The joy is in the detail of Dosunmu's film, the nuance of a relationship as richly complex as the African print dresses that Adenike favours.</Review>

        <Duration>108</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Two youths from the Brooklyn projects attempt to fend for themselves on the streets after their parents are arrested in this urban drama from director George Tillman, Jr. (Notorious, Faster). It's summer in New York City, and 14-year-old Mister (Skylan Brooks) is hungry. His irresponsible mother unable to hold down a job, Mister's situation goes from bad to worse when she is taken into custody, and child protective services attempts to track him down. Meanwhile, nine-year-old friend Pete finds himself in the same sinking boat. Together, Mister and Pete search for sustenance while attempting to avoid the violence that plagues their neighborhood. All the while Mister grows to feel invincible, never realizing that it's his vulnerability - not his youthful bravado - that's truly his saving grace. Jennifer Hudson, Jeffrey Wright, Anthony Mackie, and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje co-star. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>This is an impressive piece of grass-roots filmmaking.</Review>
            <Review>A gritty, sometimes downright heartwrenching story of two young boys left to fend for themselves for weeks during a boiling-hot summer in a Brooklyn housing project.</Review>
            <Review>Proves to be as awkward as its title thanks to its uneven screenplay and tone, and questionable casting in supporting parts.</Review>
            <Review>Pitched fascinatingly, at times uneasily, between misery and uplift, "Mister &amp; Pete" tells the story of an endlessly resourceful child who survives the unimaginable over one long summer.</Review>
            <Review>They may be tiny little kids, but they deliver outsize performances.</Review>
            <Review>"The Inevitable Defeat of Mister &amp; Pete" is a moving bit of mischief and mayhem that will break your heart, give you hope, make you laugh, possibly cry.</Review>
            <Review>Everyone involved here does so much good work that the film's blemishes are easy to overlook.</Review>
            <Review>Directing pitfalls notwithstanding, these young stars deliver such earnest performances that the audience will find it hard not to be moved by their tale.</Review>
            <Review>At its best, the movie is emotionally rapturous, helped along by Brooks's incredible talent. At its worst, while it avoids falling into poverty porn (to my judgment, at least), it runs into a kind of hysteria of putting children in danger.</Review>
            <Review>The expressive performances of the two young protagonists helps to smooth over the rough spots in a script that too often turns sappy and heavy-handed.</Review>
            <Review>Mister and Pete are, as the title goes, inevitably served up defeat at practically every turn, but ultimately it is outweighed by the strength and resilience the pair come to consistently display in the oppressive face of it.</Review>
            <Review>Even more welcome than its unusual story content is its humanistic impulse: It comes from a place of respect for its characters and belief in their dignity; by extension, it offers these same courtesies to its audience.</Review>

            <Review>Even in a work of science fiction like this, Gleeson seems beyond real. All those foam-faces being made in the dark? They're for him.</Review>
            <Review>Some people will revel in this warm front of innocence; others will reach for their Voltaire.</Review>
            <Review>There's a lot of comic and fantasy potential here, but much of it gets squandered.</Review>
            <Review>To get to the parts that are un-terrible, you have to suffer through the most idiotic plot developments and ill-defined characters imaginable.</Review>
            <Review>You may as well check your cynicism at the door, because Curtis &amp; Co. are going to find a way to trample all over it - adorably.</Review>
            <Review>With more attention to detail, this could have worked, but the time travel aspects are so badly executed that the movie as a whole falters and eventually rips apart at the seams.</Review>
            <Review>If you have ever entertained the possibility of swimming against the current of your own time stream and remaking key choices therein, then you've likely put more thought into this premise than Curtis did.</Review>
            <Review>Young love provides the framework for About Time, the latest movie from writer-director Richard Curtis. But the heart of the film is a story about a boy, his father and the greatest gift they can give each other: their time.</Review>
            <Review>[Gleeson] fully embodies Tim's affability, and the chemistry between him and Rachel is lovely. But even better is his chemistry with his on-screen dad, Bill Nighy.</Review>
            <Review>"It's just so overflowing with ideas and characters that the main point it's trying to make nearly eludes it."</Review>
            <Review>The film matures from a mere romcom into something older and wiser, as Tim and his dad have some heart-to-hearts that end up becoming lessons for all of us in how to live.</Review>
            <Review>With About Time, Curtis plays things even more low-key but the charm and easy ear for everyday dialogue and real characters are still here, and help to make it a warmly entertaining piece of fluff for even the most cynical.</Review>

            <Review>A Case Of You's characters and plot points will be familiar to anyone who's seen a movie in which a neurotic urbanite pines for a beautiful girl.</Review>
            <Review>"A Case of You" is perfectly enjoyable as far as indie rom coms go - just not particularly original.</Review>
            <Review>While this unrelentingly midtempo movie milks Brooklyn for its chic, it manages to denude it of its color.</Review>
            <Review>A Case of You is a disappointing romantic comedy that aspires to social relevance until the third act, when it settles for pat Freudian revelations.</Review>
            <Review>Wood makes Birdie approachable enough that Sam's continuing treatment of her as a fantasy-girl, who could only like a fictionalized version of him, grows tiresome as the film progresses.</Review>
            <Review>A Case of You can't exactly achieve its romantic ambitions, yet it's still an easy watch.</Review>
            <Review>If the movie managed to inspire even an iota of investment in whether or not Sam and Birdie (ugh) would end up together, I'd call it a perfectly adequate date night rental. But it's too insubstantial for that.</Review>
            <Review>A winning romantic comedy...</Review>
            <Review>Some jokes land as intended, and there's a weirdly star-studded supporting cast, but Corio isn't brave enough to make the movie matter, eventually submitting to painfully labored formula to land this underwhelming effort.</Review>
            <Review>Its third act conflict and resolution all seem motivated not by the characters on screen chafing at change, growth or surrender, but instead by scenes from other movies.</Review>
            <Review>Simply not enough happens, and the screenwriters might have been wise to add a subsidiary relationship plotline to the mix, focus more on Sam's attempts at more serious writing, or just give those hungry, generous and funny actor pals more to do.</Review>

            <Review>Free Birds is not (sorry) a turkey of a film. But it doesn't really soar terribly high either.</Review>
            <Review>A lot of agreeable kookiness compensates for the ramshackle script in this tale of turkeys traveling back in time to prevent becoming an essential part of Thanksgiving dinner.</Review>
            <Review>The movie's animal rights, vegetarian message should go down easily with politically correct parents - at least until they choke on the offensive depiction of 17th-century turkeys as face-painted, headband-wearing native Americans.</Review>
            <Review>Everything about "Free Birds" feels perfunctory, from its generic title and holiday setting to its starry voice cast and undistinguished use of 3-D.</Review>
            <Review>A stale turkey hash that heaves a lot of ingredients in the oven but never turns on the gas, a frantic attempt to come up with an animated film built around Thanksgiving Day traditions.</Review>
            <Review>A forgettable - and occasionally borderline offensive - animated tale of turkeys trying to take back Thanksgiving.</Review>
            <Review>In the end, this freeform history lesson is a flightless foul.</Review>
            <Review>Much of the better comedy is wasted on the younger viewers, with complex historical and cultural references kids just won't get.</Review>
            <Review>Any given scene from Free Birds seems more like a YouTube parody of stupid children's films than a piece of something that real human beings put together with honest artistic intent.</Review>
            <Review>These birds are good to look at, and you can easily get caught up in the characters. But the situation is a bit too much to swallow . . . even for Thanksgiving.</Review>
            <Review>This family-friendly animation gets off to an amusing start but soon flies off into la-la land.</Review>
            <Review>The muddled story and lacklustre animation makes this a film that's strictly for the birds.</Review>

        <Duration>84</Duration>
        <StoryLine>A psychological-thriller in the haunting tradition of films like Taxi Driver and Monster, Dark Tourist takes us into the chilling labyrinth of a man's dark hobby and his even darker mind. Jim Tahana (Michael Cudlitz) doesn't leave much of an impression when he passes you by. But look closer and you'll sense his hunger - the deep hunger of an insatiable American soul - always scanning to devour something - anything that might fill the searing, unexplained void within him. Jim obsesses over the hobby that has been part of his DNA since he was a young boy: dark tourism - the act of traveling with the intent to visit places of tragedy or disaster. Every year his week-long vacations from work are spent going to dark tourist locations in the lives of different serial killers he is fascinated with. This year's obsession is Carl Marznap (Pruitt Taylor Vince), a mass murder from New Orleans, Louisiana. But this trip is no ordinary vacation as Jim's rancid sexual impulses and weakening grip on reality deteriorate into a violent despair that will ultimately unlock an unspeakable secret festering within him, bringing Dark Tourist to its brutal and shocking finale.

World War II was raging across Europe when Stalin created a top-secret biochemical weapon that could decimate his enemies. Later, when the smoke cleared over Stalingrad, the powerful nerve gas was nowhere to be found. Flash forward over 70 years, and there's a strange wind blowing through the streets of Bulgaria. Corpses are climbing out of their graves, and the streets have been overrun by flesh-eating mutants. Though it's too late to contain the infection, US Special Forces Captain John McGahey (Paul Logan) and NATO Dr. Ana Bennett (Manal El-Feitury) are determined to escape the country alive. But they better be fast, because now the entire country is on Code Red, and it won't be long until the bombs start to fall.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Returning to some of the same themes she explored in her short films, Émond continues her smart contemplation of youth and the difficulties of making meaningful emotional connections in these times.</Review>
            <Review>This is a different kind of movie, as graphic as porn, but not porn, not titillating and not unintelligent.</Review>
            <Review>Despite the allure of the actors and some witty lines, it's ultimately quite wearying to be confronted with such determination to turn youth and good looks into existential burdens.</Review>
            <Review>They invest so much humanity in their miserable characters that despite your dislike, you empathize enough to think, there but for the grace of God.</Review>
            <Review>Except for the graphic sex, this talkathong is pretty much a drag.</Review>
            <Review>Conveys through soulless stranger sex, current youth's emotionally and economically distressed powerlessness, false freedoms and an absence of future. Much more than a love story, the film is possibly, according to Émond, 'the night before revolution.'</Review>

        <StoryLine>"1" is an action documentary showcasing the glamour, speed, danger and excitement of Formula One Grand Prix racing. Narrated by Michael Fassbender, the film tells the story of the golden age of Formula 1 (R), when the sport became terrifyingly dangerous. In the late 1960s, Formula 1 (R) cars doubled their engine size and sprouted wings, making them incredibly quick, but even more hazardous. With money pouring in from sponsorship and a new worldwide television audience, superstar drivers were born, thrown like gladiators into the ring. The drivers were legendary with charisma and raw talent, but many of them paid the ultimate price. "1" follows the story of the drivers who raced on the edge and those who stood up to change the sport forever. It is about the greatest show on earth, Formula 1 (R)</StoryLine>

            <Review>The wrongs pile up, and there's a clear object of satire. That feels new for the Jackass experience: a target that isn't a crotch. I'd like to see Irv try to strike again with braver gags.</Review>
            <Review>Onlookers occasionally glance into the camera, a pretty good sign that people are hip to these prankster movies now and just play along.</Review>
            <Review>It's been 11 years since Jackass: The Movie, and three since Jackass 3D, although it feels a lot longer than that.</Review>
            <Review>Like the lime-green bingo dabber contents Irving drinks down to the horror of his seatmates, it's an acquired taste.</Review>
            <Review>It's not really a movie. It's Johnny Knoxville and his Jackass crew faking out real people into believing he's 86-year-old Irving Zisman, an old fart bag traveling cross-country.</Review>
            <Review>Sometimes joy buzzers - and pratfalls, and funny costumes - are really all you need for a laugh or two. Or even a three-star comedy.</Review>
            <Review>For comedy fans, "Bad Grandpa" is a no-brainer. In every possible way.</Review>
            <Review>An unfunny 'comedy' full of cheap crudity and punches down at targets who don't deserve it. For some movies there should be hazard pay.</Review>
            <Review>It's foul and filthy but only occasionally funny.</Review>
            <Review>Bad Grandpa's biggest, most eyebrow-rising surprise may very well be the fact that we actually grow to care about him and Billy by the final reel</Review>
            <Review>Stuffs male jackassery into a paper-thin piñata of a contrived plot, then blindly bashes us over the head, again and again, with a stick marked 'SEE WHAT AN OLD MAN AND A YOUNG BOY CAN GET AWAY WITH!'</Review>

Convinced that the tornados tearing through the shores of Boston are the first wave of a devastating storm front, extreme weather expert Joe Randall watches in horror as the winds shift inland. It's an unprecedented weather phenomenon that could destroy the entire Eastern Seaboard, and the only means of stopping it may be a radical theory that flies in the face of modern meteorology. Now, as Joe's children find themselves trapped in a nearby stadium as the storm gains momentum, the concerned father recruits the two people he trusts most to help validate his controversial theory, and save the city. Meanwhile, their efforts may actually be accelerating the storm front, instead of subduing it.</StoryLine>

Daniel Samsa (John Holgren) of the Samsa foundation is determined to learn the facts about that tragic case, and he's brought along the late convict's daughter Carrie (Daisy Leonard) to help contact him in the afterlife. Joining this pair in their supernatural quest is an ex-con named Hector (Dan Herrera), an itinerant psychic named Jason (Stu Brumbaugh), and an intuitive named Frank (Mick O'Day).

            <Review>Metallica is as fierce and intense as ever, and the greatest hits set the band performs is a barrage of heavy riff-age that captures the band at its most vital.</Review>
            <Review>In the real world, concerts build to a climax, then return for two or three more; on the screen, alas, "Metallica: Through the Never" just kind of peters out.</Review>
            <Review>Metallica: Through the Never- three-quarters-concert film, one-quarter-disaster epic-is the most fun I've had at the movies this year.</Review>
            <Review>For a loyal fan, this is something of a godsend.</Review>
            <Review>Giddily preposterous.</Review>
            <Review>Two films wrangling for dominance and neither finding the purchase necessary to succeed.</Review>
            <Review>If Through the Never's attempts at creating a story-and-performance hybrid are only partially successful...its concert footage remains its prime selling point and strength.</Review>
            <Review>If Through the Never was a straight ahead concert film it would be a masterpiece of heavy metal showmanship. Yet this is a two headed beast, with one side charging forward while the other is sitting lame in a state of morose confusion.</Review>

            <Review>The suggestion that prostitution is a risk-free route to self-discovery for suburban soccer moms is glib bordering on offensive, but Robin Weigert is tough and terrific in the lead.</Review>
            <Review>Unfortunately, Passon can't seem to figure out her own protagonist; there are plenty of sexual climaxes here but not much of a narrative one.</Review>
            <Review>An engrossing meditation on modern alienation and the ways we cope when we discover something missing in our lives.</Review>
            <Review>It's on the dull side, despite a fair amount of tasteful, non-explicit sex.</Review>
            <Review>[Weigert] and Passon team up to create an indelible portrait of a woman who may always be a work in progress.</Review>
            <Review>This might sound, at the very least, titillating, but "Concussion" is anything but.</Review>
            <Review>Perhaps aimed to be a combination of Desperate Housewives and Belle de Jour, with a lesbian twist, Concussion turns out to be surprisingly bland.</Review>
            <Review>A very subtle, sophisticated take on modern relationships driven, naturally, by [Robin] Weigert's nuanced, hard edged performance.</Review>
            <Review>Abby's pursuit would appear wildly implausible, but Weigert makes it seem perfectly natural, conveying Abby's restless longings and wry curiosity, the sense that she is exploring her identity as much as fulfilling her desires</Review>
            <Review>Much of the narrative may not ring true, but Weigert's performance is warm and engaging, lending not just heart, but much needed credibility.</Review>
            <Review>A sharply observed odyssey of middle-aged self-discovery, this strikingly offbeat film may feel a little vague in its approach, but it carries a strong kick.</Review>
            <Review>Stacie Passon's drama is like Luis Buñuel's Belle de Jour without much of the humour or surrealism.</Review>

            <Review>As nervy and as excitable as the trade that it depicts.</Review>
            <Review>The material covered in the production's 128 minutes is not only inherently non-cinematic but not remotely "thrilling," at least in the conventional sense.</Review>
            <Review>The Fifth Estate is also as current as a news feed, filling in the disputed facts about Assange's life beyond the headlines and chronicling the revolution that has upended the media landscape in the last decade.</Review>
            <Review>Director Bill Condon delivers an intelligent, dynamic, character-centered drama.</Review>
            <Review>Condon and his screenwriter Josh Singer don't quite know what to make of this duo, perhaps because the men didn't quite know what to make of each other, either.</Review>
            <Review>"The Fifth Estate" feels unfortunately small and safe.</Review>
            <Review>Yes a stellar cast was compiled, but it rings false nonetheless.</Review>
            <Review>There are real treasures to be had here, the most prestigious of which is an effortless turn from Benedict Cumberbatch as Julian Assange.</Review>
            <Review>This breathless thriller that treats the speed of data as a matter of life and death.</Review>
            <Review>Benedict Cumberbatch's performance is the knockout, precise, conflicted, mysterioso, wily, his own charm alloyed with the Aussie oddness of Assange.</Review>
            <Review>The film never seems to know what it wants to be, or where it is going with all of these gimmicks, gadgets and subplots. It ends up as a yawner, a thriller with no thrills, history without context.</Review>
            <Review>A great performance surrounded by a very bad movie.</Review>

            <Review>The film, directed by Jon Turteltaub, has an easy but mediocre charm.</Review>
            <Review>The actors perform with multiple safety nets and the closest the film ever comes to taking a risk is having Freeman dance to a cover of Earth Wind &amp; Fire's "September."</Review>
            <Review>"This is the like "The Hangover Part 43."</Review>
            <Review>It's bad enough when Hollywood casts women over the age of 30 as grandmothers-in-waiting. Now we have to endure an onslaught of famous veteran actors complaining about their hips.</Review>
            <Review>A preholiday trifle that's mildly risqué and a lot sentimental.</Review>
            <Review>Last Vegas simply lacks the excitement you'd hope for.</Review>
            <Review>The climactic revelations of the secrets, sacrifices and regrets that it took to maintain lifelong friendships are so poignant, they assuage any nagging suspicion that these four legends might be coasting on their reputations.</Review>
            <Review>It's a cast of relaxed old pros with easy chemistry, all of whom seem to be having a great deal of fun. The feeling is almost mutual.</Review>
            <Review>Michael Douglas, Robert De Niro, Morgan Freeman and Kevin Kline may all be pushing or past 70, but there's a surprisingly jaunty spring to their step in this breezy comedy.</Review>
            <Review>"(It) could have been and probably should have been more accurately titled 'Jokes about Elderly Aches, Pains and Complaints: The Movie.'"</Review>

            <Review>An entertaining movie with two solid performances that only occasionally stalls because of its sometimes heavy-handed treatment of Hunt and Lauda's differences.</Review>
            <Review>Considering the subject matter, Rush delivers the expected visceral jolts; what's surprising is how endearing it is, even when its two protagonists are behaving like little more than boys with very fast toys.</Review>
            <Review>The script is another Peter Morgan special. Like, say, The Queen and Frost/Nixon, it's a speculative duet built around a moment of newsworthiness.</Review>
            <Review>If you don't already know the story of that season, lucky you; even now, it exerts a ridiculous thrill.</Review>
            <Review>Rush is an outsize Hollywood spectacle about two outsize personalities in conflict, a sleekly assembled thrill machine that makes up in excitement for what it lacks in nuance.</Review>
            <Review>Rush is not a particularly deep film. But more importantly, it is not a film that mistakes itself for deep. And this self-knowledge makes Rush, in some ways, a wiser film than many that aspire to loftier goals.</Review>
            <Review>Nearly as narratively compelling as it is viscerally thrilling, "Rush" is [Ron] Howard's most efficient film since "Apollo 13."</Review>
            <Review>Thuddingly obvious and proud of it, Rush is a slick, breakneck entertainment.</Review>
            <Review>"Rush" does for Racing what "Rocky" did for Boxing.</Review>
            <Review>Howard's good sense on Rush is to repeat his Frost/Nixon success by surrounding himself with superior writing and acting talent</Review>
            <Review>Rush is pure 'print the myth' stuff -- but since both its heroes really are myths, it gets away with it, with more grace and vigor than you might expect.</Review>
            <Review>One of the best looking and sounding films of the year on top of being one of the most exciting.</Review>

On the cusp of their ninth anniversary, James and Nina seem to have the perfect marriage and ideal lives - an affluent life in Amsterdam, lucrative jobs and adoring friends. Yet when Nina discovers James's infidelity with a mutual friend of theirs after a long line of extramarital affairs, it's the final straw, shattering whatever illusions they've created about their relationship and leaving them separated. Heartbroken about their separation, a stroke of luck leads Nina to impersonate James's chatty travel agent on the phone, and he's soon pouring his heart out and unwittingly falling for his wife all over again as they discuss the uncertainty of love and the eternal misunderstanding between men and women.(C) IFC</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>Past present and future mix in this eloquent, intense and surprisingly humorous portrait of documentary filmmaker David Fisher and his siblings, as they retrace the footsteps of their late father-a Holocaust survivor who was interned in Gusen and Gunskirchen, Austria. David's journey takes him to the U.S., where he meets American WWII veterans who participated in the liberation of his father and Gunskirchen camp. This sparks a remarkable journey to Austria by the Fisher siblings. They joke, kibitz and quarrel, and remind us that history and memory require active discussion among the later generations. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>As with any kind of episodic or sketch comedy, some gags land more effectively than others, although you'll likely find a line or a beat or an image that makes you laugh from start to finish.</Review>
            <Review>The road adventures they have along the way aren't funny, and once they reach the pageant, the comic payoff you're hoping for never materializes.</Review>
            <Review>Where movie comedy teams once required a "straight" member - or so-called normal characters - off which to bounce stupidity or silliness, Raphael and Wilson believe total immersion in thickheadedness and failure is riot enough.</Review>
            <Review>Raphael and Wilson are impressively committed to these misadventures, but it's a shame the movie is so cruel to the characters.</Review>
            <Review>Ass Backwards overcomes the obvious beats with clever, occasionally dark jokes that reveal the sharpness of its stars' writing.</Review>
            <Review>Wilson and Raphael have been a comedy team for years, and they riff off each other expertly; too often, however, that's all they do.</Review>
            <Review>Chris Nelson's Ass Backwards certainly doesn't aspire to being anything more than passing entertainment. But sadly, this listless, flat, and exceptionally derivative movie doesn't even achieve that modest goal.</Review>
            <Review>It's a little slapdash, a little flimsy, and doesn't seem to quite know what it wants to be at times, but it's good to see Raphael and Wilson get the chance to finally carry something for once.</Review>
            <Review>Ass Backwards is a film that is all-at-once hilarious, intelligent, poignant and accessible.</Review>
            <Review>Wilson and Raphael do not hold back in their performances, fully committing to their roles and making Chloe and Kate both lovable and laughable.</Review>
            <Review>This is a feature that opens and closes with shots of women urinating. No amount of high-beam comedic work is going save a picture that doesn't have much imagination to begin with.</Review>
            <Review>The pessimistic, passive-aggressive "Ass Backwards" may have been written by women, but one would never guess it judging by the evidence onscreen.</Review>

            <Review>It's a story of contained chaos, quietly observed - one that catches fire more in retrospect than in the viewing.</Review>
            <Review>Porterfield's film doesn't offer much in the way of plot, but the ways the characters bounce off one another in small spaces are precisely observed, and the actors have a lot of soul ...</Review>
            <Review>Unfolds like a music album, with emotive songs supplying information that doesn't need repeating in the lean screenplay, which the director co-wrote with Amy Belk.</Review>
            <Review>The couple, both musicians, are in the midst of a bitter breakup, and Porterfield frequently trains the camera on one or the other as each performs his melancholy tunes; this stops the narrative dead in its tracks.</Review>
            <Review>The visual style of third-time director Matthew Porterfield ("Putty Hill," "Hamilton") is emphatically lyrical, beginning with a widescreen shot of a Maryland Ferris wheel that suggests a celebration of Americana.</Review>
            <Review>Nuanced performances by the non-professional cast and a haunting soundtrack help fill in the deliberate narrative gaps.</Review>
            <Review>Jeremy Saulnier's summer-spent cinematography is gentle and nothing shy of exquisite.</Review>

            <Review>This delicate, compassionate film has an emotional impact.It unfolds the austere European way, without the heavy baggage of backstory.</Review>
            <Review>...by its end, the film had worked its way under our skin deeper than we expected, and through skilfully unobtrusive editing and camerawork, we felt we had a clear, honest picture of these lives.</Review>

        <StoryLine>At night, an isolated house deep in the countryside takes on a monstrous life of its own. Objects and furniture run riot against the inhabitants, leaving 11-year-old Neve the only survivor of a bloody massacre that destroys the bodies of her parents and culminates in the death of her little brother, Ciaran. Suspecting a gang of homicidal vandals, the police ignore Neve when she tries to tell them about the murderous rage of the house. She is taken in by friends of her parents who, with the help of a local social worker, try to ease her trauma by surrounding her with love and rebuilding the semblance of a normal life. But Neve doesn't find peace. Far from it... All around her, signs of danger continue to manifest, and her surroundings remain imbued with a lurking violence that soon unleashes itself again, erupting into further slaughter and claiming more victims.(c) IFC Films</StoryLine>

            <Review>For all its soaring cutlery, Dark Touch, like much of the best horror, works the fears that connect to real life.</Review>
            <Review>It's hampered by its need for easy resolutions and horror set pieces, neither quite embracing nor escaping its genre roots.</Review>

            <Review>Elegantly atmospheric indie horror drama plumbs typically unseen depths of children's coping mechanisms in the face of terrible real-life experience.</Review>
            <Review>Like Carrie without the religion, or Village of the Damned without the aliens, Dark Touch is uncompromising, utterly chilling, and actually about something - the misuse of power, whether a parent's or a child's. It is also unmissable.</Review>
            <Review>De Van appears to think that throwing every horror cliche in the book at something will make for atmosphere.</Review>

            <Review>Here is a movie that, much like its eponymous character, never quite figures out what it wants to be.</Review>
            <Review>On paper, "Bad Milo!" sounds loosey-goosey-crazy-go-nuts. But in practice, it's understated, if only in relation to its bonkers premise.</Review>
            <Review>What could have been a very funny short film about self-control and befriending your id instead becomes a rambling commentary on father-son dysfunction and the limits of proctology.</Review>
            <Review>"Bad Milo!" is a cult classic in the making.</Review>
            <Review>This movie is about a monster that crawls out of a man's butt and starts killing people.</Review>
            <Review>Like a lot of intentionally shoddy or derivative movies, Bad Milo! can't overcome what it's trying to be.</Review>
            <Review>disgusting and grotesque, but also funny throughout, and amiable precisely because of its great affection for even the most odious of its characters, as befits a film so preoccupied with arseholes.</Review>
            <Review>The idea of watching Ken Marino argue with a giant haemorrhoid monster that has just popped out of his butt seems like a crazy must-see moment. Unfortunately, it comes across as flat and uninspired.</Review>
            <Review>While it's a black comedy, the humor is derived from situational issues rather than becoming a joke on itself.</Review>
            <Review>This is the year's best movie about things that come out of your rear end, which is praise that's meant to be as faint as it sounds.</Review>
            <Review>Bad Milo! is one bad ass movie-as opposed to a badass one.</Review>
            <Review>The concept runs out of gas well before the end despite the best efforts of Marino and an eclectic supporting cast.</Review>

            <Review>Over and over in this movie we hear variations on the phrase "everything's going to be OK." It's just impossible to head out of the theater and back into the wider world believing that's actually true.</Review>
            <Review>We're in the steady hands of Paul Greengrass, a director fully aware that convincing crisis stories involve conflicting interests and passions.</Review>
            <Review>The entire performance is one of the greatest in Hanks' prolific, varied career - a role that gives him a massive arc and the opportunity to show great range.</Review>
            <Review>Whether or not you find it an inadvertent parable of the political moment (I do), Captain Phillips is a terrific film.</Review>
            <Review>It's the work of Tom Hanks that makes this film unforgettable.</Review>
            <Review>This is acting of the highest order in a movie that raises the bar on what a true-life action thriller can do.</Review>
            <Review>A gripping action-thriller, one that hews closely to the events as they occurred, and offers a glimpse into the fight for survival endured by all parties to the crime.</Review>
            <Review>Captain Phillips may be a thinly scoped story with tried-and-true themes, but the acting turns it into a surprisingly captivating story of heroism.</Review>
            <Review>It seems strange to say that an actor as awarded and acclaimed as Tom Hanks is still capable of surprising us. But he does in 'Captain Phillips,' which is one of the best films of the year.</Review>
            <Review>It's a brilliantly accomplished hostage drama -- claustrophobic and breathlessly paced -- and Greengrass' commanding piloting of a Hollywood juggernaut can blind you to the film's faults.</Review>
            <Review>Great movies nearly always involve a director's galvanizing vision and an actor's willingness to let character drive performance. Captain Phillips is a great movie.</Review>
            <Review>Hanks is very good in the role - downright fantastic in its final minutes - his everyman persona going a long way in eliciting attachment on the part of the audience.</Review>

            <Review>LaBeouf, who throws himself whole-heartedly into every role regardless of its worth, is a fearless and fascinating actor, and his sincerity holds the entire sleazy mess together.</Review>
            <Review>Ah, Bucharest. That exotic, Eastern European hotbed of romance, intrigue and hefty film-production tax breaks.</Review>
            <Review>However you cut it, with all that talent, Charlie Countryman feels like a sad, wasted opportunity.</Review>
            <Review>It's a thoroughly queasy pastiche of magic-realism/coming-of-age/romantic-thriller/bloody-Chiclets nonsense (and when I say "nonsense" I am substituting a much stronger word).</Review>
            <Review>This catastrophe of a movie zigzags drunkenly between action-adventure and surreal comedy with some magical realism slopped over it like ketchup.</Review>
            <Review>Even though you learn that Charlie is absolute aces at running from bad guys, the character pretty much remains a confusing, empty vessel. As does the movie.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately, Charlie Countryman bites off more than it can chew and winds up feeling more absurd than memorable.</Review>
            <Review>A wildly unauthentic offering, that manages to take such raw, human emotions, and produce a picture that revels, frustratingly, in frivolity and irreverence.</Review>
            <Review>As for Shia, he's wildly self-indulgent and narcissistic: all puppy eyes, emoting and angsting like there's no tomorrow. He just doesn't know when eneouf is eneouf.</Review>
            <Review>The weird filmography of Shia LaBeouf, from Fury to Nymphomaniac via Transformers, continues with an ecstasy-fuelled excursion to eastern Europe in the bizarre The Necessary Death of Charlie Countryman.</Review>
            <Review>This is a weird and self-indulgent affair that is easy to mock but that, just occasionally, captures the romantic feel of the equally pretentious but magical Leos Carax films of the late 1980s.</Review>

            <Review>Lives constructed on pretense can only stand for so long. Watching them collapse is appalling but undeniably entertaining.</Review>
            <Review>There is all this talent -- and so little reason for it in Woody Allen's Blue Jasmine.</Review>
            <Review>A sharply observed, post-economic crash comedy-drama that boasts a formidable performance by Cate Blanchett and addresses such pertinent real-world concerns as class, gender and corporate criminality in urban America.</Review>
            <Review>The exquisite Blanchett amazes, bringing brittleness and vulnerability to a woman on the edge.</Review>
            <Review>You have to dig deep in Allen's back catalogue to find a single performance as affecting and well-judged as the one Cate Blanchett delivers.</Review>
            <Review>It's narratively uneven but the occasional lapses of focus are rescued by Cate Blanchett's riveting lead performance.</Review>
            <Review>"Blue Jasmine" is that rare film that's both a true ensemble piece and a showcase for its lead.</Review>
            <Review>Blue Jasmine could've been more comedic, but Blanchett's heavy performance really gave this story a new life on its own.</Review>
            <Review>There's a reason why Woody Allen's screenplays have been nominated for 15 Academy Awards (R). Comic genius, dramatic wit, sharp observation, great characters. With Blue Jasmine, he has taken effete snobbery to glorious heights.</Review>
            <Review>Andrew Dice Clay holding his own against Cate Blanchett? Now I've seen it all.</Review>
            <Review>Blanchett is impressive as a woman constantly teetering on the edge of collapse; there's a perpetual sense something tragic simmers beneath her constructed facade.</Review>
            <Review>Jasmine is a cautionary virago for anyone who's ever witnessed a friend unknowingly muttering just within earshot, just within the frame of reality. Jasmine's headlong fall is fearsome, lugubrious, and ultimately, exasperating.</Review>

            <Review>There's a difference between paying your dues and self-abasement, but you wouldn't know it from this overstuffed and joyless film.</Review>
            <Review>Like her character, Bell has made herself a contender in a male-dominated industry. And a damn funny one at that.</Review>
            <Review>It's an exhilarating comic rush called In a World... and in it Lake Bell spins inspired lunacy around the subject of, among other things like family dysfunction, sexual healing and female empowerment, voiceovers.</Review>
            <Review>A clever, likable comedy that sends up sexism, satirizes Hollywood, examines family ties and features a surprisingly tender romance at its core</Review>
            <Review>An indie comedy as surprisingly tender and wise as it is deftly wise-cracking.</Review>
            <Review>A fascinating look into the realm of voice over performance.</Review>
            <Review>Very funny semi-satirical look at the bitchy, male-dominated world of movie trailer voice over people.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director Lake Bell is also the star of this quick-witted beguiling comedy of female identity, family ties and an unseen but fiercely competitive aspect of the film business.</Review>
            <Review>The entire cast operates at the top of their game. Yet it's Bell who is undeniably the main attraction.</Review>
            <Review>Though she had to write, direct, and produce the damn thing herself, Bell finally has a film that puts her full range of comedic, rom-com-ready abilities on display.</Review>
            <Review>It will gently settle into the undistinguished ranks of history's perfectly okay works of art. I won't sing it's praises, but I don't regret watching it either.</Review>

With the help of her only friend, LaSonia, who lives in the trailer next door and the musical encouragement of the specter of a mystical Blues Singer, Willadean fights to break the cycle of the sick dance between the abuser and the abused. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>Valentin (Eugenio Derbez) is Acapulco's resident playboy-until a former fling leaves a baby on his doorstep and takes off without a trace. Valentin leaves Mexico for Los Angeles to find the baby's mother, but only ends up finding a new home for himself and his newfound daughter, Maggie (Loreto Peralta). An unlikely father figure, Valentin raises Maggie for six years, while also establishing himself as one of Hollywood's top stuntmen to pay the bills, with Maggie acting as his on-set coach. As Valentin raises Maggie, she forces him to grow up too. But their unique and offbeat family is threatened when Maggie's birth mom shows up out of the blue, and Valentin realizes he's in danger of losing his daughter- and his best friend.

            <Review>The film's counterintuitive success is largely due to Derbez, who demonstrates why he is beloved, both south and north of the border.</Review>
            <Review>This sporadically amusing but unduly protracted dramedy devolves into a shameless tearjerker in its third act.</Review>
            <Review>There's a lot of movie here with unexpected developments, held together by the irresistible chemistry between Derbez and his adorable pint-sized co-star.</Review>
            <Review>"Instructions Not Included" is a sweet little movie that is more than it seems to be.</Review>
            <Review>Derbez, even as a debutant filmmaker, shows his solid formation in movies and proves himself as an able narrator. [Full Review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>An endearing comedy with that can captivate all kinds of moviegores.[Full Review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Without the flaws in the script or in the mood, It might have come without complications rather than get stuck in endless jokes that haunt us until the end credits. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>A totally manipulative film that stems from a really tired premise. [Full Review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Surprisingly touching father/daughter story. Humor and heart make a winning combination.</Review>
            <Review>It's not a great film, but for what it wants to do, it's a decent diversion.</Review>
            <Review>Derbez, a sharp comedic actor with an emotive face, ably shoulders most of the film's emotional burden.</Review>
            <Review>Unevenly handled, slurrying emotions in a way that feels careless rather than cleverly unconventional.</Review>

            <Review>Machete Kills is a film in which style sardonically routs substance, a cloying gag built around the iconic quality of Trejo's matchlessly craggy face, which resembles a plate of sundried corned beef.</Review>
            <Review>Machete Kills plays like a joke that's been told a few times too often.</Review>
            <Review>A self-aware exploitation picture that winks as it picks your pocket.</Review>
            <Review>When a celebrity chef like Rodriguez is just going through the motions, we can smell that the grindhouse fad is way past its expiration date. It's time to put a fork in it.</Review>
            <Review>"Machete Kills" is barely a movie. It's an inside joke wrapped in a fanboy fantasy, pieced together through a haze of ironic detachment.</Review>
            <Review>Endless assault weapons, exploding helicopters, crashing cars and floors splattered with blood, limbs and entrails, all adding up to nothing.</Review>
            <Review>Bigger, more ambitious, and more raucous, Machete Kills stands as a film that proves more can, sometimes, be less.</Review>
            <Review>Maybe... 'neo-grindhouse' has become a 'genre' because Tarantino's Midas touch turned grindhouse into ... art? Grindhouse sort of sounds like 'art house.' On the other hand-nah.</Review>
            <Review>The stunt casting is so poorly realized that actors pop in and out of the film at random, the story apparently stitched together according to actors' schedules.</Review>
            <Review>"Machete will return in: Machete Kills!" boomed the gritty voiceover dude at the end of Robert Rodriguez's 2010 Mexploitation parody. Three years later, we're reminded that it was a threat, not a promise.</Review>
            <Review>Everything looks artificial and achieved in post-production. Every shortcut is met to save money on budget and time.</Review>

        <StoryLine>In the midst of time comes the clanging of steel against steel, a collision of myth, history and fiction.... "Vikingdom". Loosely based on Viking legends and the epic poems they left as record, with a creative interpretation, "Vikingdom" is a fantasy, action adventure about a forgotten king, Eirick, who was tasked with the impossible odds to defeat Thor, the God of Thunder. Thor is on a mission to gather the key ancient relics - "Mjolnir" - his hammer from Valhalla, "Necklace of Mary Magdalene" from Mitgard and the "Horn" from Helheim. This needs to be accomplished before the Blood Eclipse, which happens once every 800 years, failing which, the pagan Viking Gods will never be able to rule and conquer mankind ever again. Only one man can stop him... Eirick, the undead.(c) Official Facebook</StoryLine>

        <ReleaseDate> 2012</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>85</Duration>
        <StoryLine>An Encounter with Simone Weil tells the story of French philosopher, activist, and mystic, Simone Weil (1909-1943) who spent most of her too-short life advocating for the rights of the socially and politically disadvantaged. On her quest to understand Simone Weil, filmmaker Julia Haslett confronts profound questions of moral responsibility both within her own family and the broader context of 21st century America. Using Weil's writings and teachings as a framework for her own experience, Haslett creates a moving portrait of an extraordinary young woman whose decision to act on her convictions proved that the quest to live a principled life is a journey we should all consider taking. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

        <Duration>97</Duration>
        <StoryLine>In 2008, the wheels feel off the global economy effectively wiping out Patrick Lovell's American Dream just as it was coming to fruition. As a result, Lovell was swept up in an economic avalanche that nearly destroyed everything he'd been building for the previous decade. Like millions upon millions of American's, his world was turned upside-down and it would take everything he had to survive and keep his family intact. Several years later, he miraculously manifested the opportunity to go on a journey in an attempt to find out what happened to the American Dream. His timing just so happened to coincide when thousands of American's poured out into the streets asking the same question. As the journey unfolds, its revealed that America no longer functions as a democracy, that capitalism is an inside rigged con, and the American Dream is effectively dead. Like millions of others, Lovell is now faced with the perplexing dilemma of what can be done to turn it all around.</StoryLine>

        <Duration>95</Duration>
        <StoryLine>After losing his job David is pushed by his roommate to hire a life coach named Joyce. A decision aided in part by how pretty David finds this life coach, but also a desire to get unstuck in life. When Joyce invites him to join the volunteer group she takes to a retirement home David discovers his manipulative ex-boss, William, is part of the group and interested in Joyce as well. The motley crew of retirees instantly recognize the potential for drama with this love triangle. A wily old man goads the boys to battle for Joyce. As a result, David begrudgingly agrees to go to an open mic night Joyce holds for people to ponder the existence of God. It's there that a poet says a few things that cause David's head to tilt and move him a little further down the path of finding himself. The problem is the ungentlemanly competition he's still in with William. When that turns extreme, David makes a decision that nearly ruins his dual-level progress with Joyce. He's then forced to turn to the only community he has left, the ragtag band of retirees who point him in the direction of true north. A uniquely faith-friendly romantic comedy starring Grammy Award winner Rebecca St. James and Academy Award winner Shirley Jones. (c) Official site</StoryLine>

        <Duration>102</Duration>
        <StoryLine>In the vein of Friday Night Lights and The Blind Side, UNDERDOGS is based on the inspirational true events of a high school football team no one expected to succeed. In small town America, high-school football is everything. For the players, it provides notoriety and a possible ticket to a bigger world. For the community, it's a source of pride. Filmed in Canton, Ohio, UNDERDOGS focuses on the Knights, a lousy team who've become an easy target for jokes. Just when they begin to give up hope, a new coach arrives, helping the lovable losers see their true potential. At the same time, quarterback Bobby Burkett falls in love with a cheerleader from a rival powerhouse, the Vikings. This enrages Vikings' star, John Handon, a bratty rich kid who has his eye on the same girl. Meanwhile, Bobby's father is waging his own war with Handon's dad, whose crooked corporation is suing him over an invention he patented. UNDERDOGS ventures deeper than most films in the sports genre. Using football as a backdrop, director Doug Dearth has crafted a heartwarming and rabble-rousing crowd pleaser, that's sure to have both young and old on their feet by it's exhilarating ending.

            <Review>A forgettable film.</Review>
            <Review>It's terribly long and repetitive for so delicately dreamy a diptych, and at times the modern-day story feels like little more than a drawn-out apologia for the wandering male gaze.</Review>
            <Review>Goes from intriguing to irritating.</Review>
            <Review>Feels less like a movie than like a cinematic jigsaw puzzle whose agitation undermines the very continuity it wants to portray.</Review>
            <Review>Decade-hopping metaphysical romance descends into overwrought histrionics.</Review>
            <Review>This mushy, mystical French-Canadian melodrama tries to make parallel a pair of love stories: one between preteens with Down syndrome in 1969 Paris, and the second between a Quebecois DJ and his new amour some 40 years later.</Review>
            <Review>You may not ultimately agree with Valée's big spiritual pay off (it may be interpreted as a mere excuse for a middle-aged man to have an affair) but it's undeniably gripping, creative, and brash cinema.</Review>
            <Review>Café de Flore very much floored me and its enigmatic charm continued to weasel its way into my mind long after it was over.</Review>
            <Review>An intriguingly unconventional drama that revels in dreamy interludes, stream-of-consciousness montages and weighty drama - but that never lives up to its stylistic promise.</Review>
            <Review>The cumulative effect is more tedious than profound.</Review>
            <Review>As abstract as the film is in theory, it is brought together with the conclusiveness of finishing a puzzle with no missing pieces.</Review>
            <Review>Affectionate, sexy, thought-provoking, devastating, beautiful, bittersweet, life-affirming... Cafe de Flore is all that, and more. See it, listen to it, believe it.</Review>

            <Review>Maybe, in another time and place, and with different actors and a better director, it might have worked. But this thing collapses right from the get-go.</Review>
            <Review>Once past a formulaic opening, the picture opens up into something else entirely, ending up as one of the better slasher movies to hit the big screen [in decades].</Review>
            <Review>Screenwriter Simon Barrett masterfully blends horror and pitch black comedy throughout his story, and continuously finds clever ways to subvert the typical cat and mouse games we're used to seeing in these types of projects.</Review>
            <Review>Like an awesome grab bag of the best horror films from the past 30 years packed into a fun and exhilarating horror thriller.</Review>
            <Review>Flirts with being a meta-horror movie, which can be a way of making a routine slasher flick while making fun of routine slasher flicks.</Review>
            <Review>You're Next might be one of the most audience-gratifying horror films I've seen in quite a long time, rewarding the viewers as much as it likes to screw with them.</Review>
            <Review>Adam Wingard's latest, the threateningly titled You're Next, is a whip-smart whodunit in the vein of Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None (1939) and its savage progeny, the slasher movie.</Review>

        <StoryLine>If you enjoyed Free Willy, A Dolphin Tale or Big Miracle then this film is a must see. If "The Cove" left you heartbroken, then A Fall From Freedom will leave you determined, resolute and ready to make a change. This is the first comprehensive film to reveal the long and sordid history of the captive whale and dolphin entertainment business. Many of these marine parks and aquariums are directly or indirectly responsible for the death of thousands of the very animals they use for public entertainment. Premature deaths. Trainer injuries. Illegal practices. Educational misrepresentation. Government incompetence. Secret deals. These and many other issues are presented, and documented for the first time in this powerful documentary, narrated by actor Mike Farrell. (C) Indican</StoryLine>

            <Review>He's spent the bulk of his career hiding in franchises, hypermasculinizing himself. We can live with this. But this new movie makes you wonder whether Diesel can.</Review>
            <Review>David Twohy's film is scarcely original, but the sheer survivalist grind of our hero, against comical odds, becomes appealingly mad ...</Review>
            <Review>A vibrant stylistic mishmash that works brilliantly in chunks but is ultimately too scattered to sustain any cohesion.</Review>
            <Review>Riddick, an alternately kick-ass and clumsy piece of sci-fi claptrap that puts its empty head down and gets the job done.</Review>
            <Review>Fans of lean, mean, testosterone-steeped sci-fi action are likely to find Riddick kind of a blast, however -- even though it offers few surprises.</Review>
            <Review>The movie's cheap but has a sense of humor, and it's smart enough to let Riddick just get back to being a badass.</Review>
            <Review>What's disappointing about Riddick is that it never seems to figure out why we would want to follow the main character, outside of his propensity for violence and snark.</Review>

            <Review>The Butler proves a decent, significant, but slightly stodgy affair. Its dignified restraint stifles its anger.</Review>
            <Review>Amusing stunt casting aside, it's riveting to observe how civil rights evolved from inside the Oval Office</Review>

            <Review>Is anyone else in America making films like Lee Daniels? For my money, he deserves his name above the title.</Review>

            <Review>Chloe Moretz is unnervingly talented, but Carrie is not a role she was born to play. She hasn't a victim's bone in her body and fluffs the early scenes.</Review>
            <Review>It is a timeless thing for all of us, the ritual of high-school expectation and heartache. Once again, as it did nearly 40 years ago, Carrie turns it into an experience of biblical proportions.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is very good, both as a first-order viewing experience and as a contemporary gloss on Brian De Palma's classic 1976 adaptation of Stephen King's novel.</Review>
            <Review>Rather than fixing some of the problems with De Palma's approach and trying something fresh, Peirce compounds them.</Review>
            <Review>Peirce is gifted, but she lacks the ability of directors like DePalma to transform schlock into something deeply personal.</Review>
            <Review>The performances and casting are suitable, but Carrie is half the film I'd hope Peirce would make of it.</Review>
            <Review>It's a small miracle that the picture doesn't lean too heavily on one particular topic du jour - bullying - and a major miracle that it's a respectable film, to boot.</Review>
            <Review>What the new Carrie lacks in original ideas, it makes up for in many other departments.</Review>
            <Review>Sensitively directed and powerfully acted, the new version passes muster as a different take.</Review>
            <Review>A tired, unneeded copy of Brian De Palma's far superior work, with the small changes it makes adding nothing of significance.</Review>
            <Review>By taking a safe, piecemeal approach -- and treating the original a sacred text rather than completely reinventing it -- the result at times seems weirdly anachronistic.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>88</Duration>
        <StoryLine>A man is put in jeopardy when he's forced to help a family with nowhere to turn in this drama from Italian filmmaker Emanuele Crialese. Ernesto (Mimmo Cuticchio) is an elderly fisherman who lives on the Sicilian island of Linosa. The fishing business has gone into a slump and many on the island have either opened businesses catering to tourists or moved elsewhere, though his 20-year-old grandson Filippo (Filippo Pucillo) works with him over the objection of his more pragmatic mother (Donatella Finocchiaro). Political and economic unrest in North Africa has caused a growing number of people to flee the country in hopes of relocating in Europe, and the Sicilian government has firmly warned sailors not to pick up Africans attempting to enter the country illegally by boat. When Ernesto sees a young man (Rubel Tsegay Abraha) and his pregnant mother (Timnit T.) drowning after fleeing a small boat, his conscience forces him to rescue them, and when the woman gives birth not long after they reach shore, the old man and his family become unwitting criminals as they give the immigrant family a place to stay. Terraferma received its North American premiere at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>Emanuele Crialese's film burns with a sense of this situation's inhumanity, and he gives a palpable sense of life in a place where the beauty attracts tourists, but the natives are barely getting by.</Review>

            <Review>As the protagonist's solidarity is put to the test, however, Terraferma slides from detail-rich fable to Important Issue statement, its symbolism growing leaden and its characters shedding their eccentricities for masks of nobility.</Review>
            <Review>It's well-meaning, properly on the side of human rights, but also schematic and thematically heavy-handed.</Review>
            <Review>Another fine piece of work from one of the world's major filmmaking talents.</Review>

            <Review>An unusually evasive piece of filmmaking - hard to pin down, but all the more worthwhile for its craftiness.</Review>
            <Review>James Ponsoldt's The Spectacular Now is one of the uncommon pieces of teen cinema that rings true.</Review>
            <Review>Every time the film teeters on the precipice of a generic plot point it satisfyingly withdraws into more subtle and nuanced territory that ultimately coalesces in a final act that is sentimental without being sugary.</Review>
            <Review>t's a coming-of-age-slash-first-love story, with beguiling leads, a frank, bittersweet script, a lived-in, rustic setting (the outskirts of Athens, Georgia), an intense awareness of class difference and a mood that's all its own.</Review>

            <Review>Coolly controlled and extremely well-acted.</Review>
            <Review>Spare yet deeply atmospheric, the film is charged with dreadful fatalism.</Review>
            <Review>The film creates one of the most chillingly becalmed portraits of insanity I've seen.</Review>
            <Review>This lyrical, frightening film is a portrait of a man consumed by self-hatred who decided to take it out on the world.</Review>
            <Review>If Moors and Porto were aiming for gun-debate relevance, they've failed; "Blue Caprice" has nothing to say about a society plagued by violence, nor does it focus on mental illness as a probable cause.</Review>
            <Review>The film's a character piece with a tightening noose of suspense, and while it has its artsy-indie-dawdly moments, it's disturbing in ways that aren't easy to shake.</Review>
            <Review>This is a film that stubbornly refuses to sensationalize; it's not interested in how these men killed, or in exploiting and fetishizing those acts. Instead, it explores their humanity-which is revealed to be even more terrifying.</Review>
            <Review>Refusing to settle for easy exploitation, director Alexandre Moors paints a vivid, bone-chilling picture of the corrupting power of evil.</Review>
            <Review>Blue Caprice lays out the details of a terrible time for Americans.</Review>
            <Review>...a half-baked endeavor that's unable to entirely live up to the promise of its setup and stellar performances.</Review>
            <Review>It may be too much slow-burning style for those looking for true-crime substance only, but a cool patience is what drives Blue Caprice.</Review>
            <Review>Blue Caprice is a fascinating character study and a fictionalized, human look at two people who went on a murderous rampage and killed innocent people for their beliefs.</Review>

            <Review>Michael B. Jordan is simply brilliant in his portrayal of Grant, whom Coogler presents as a generally happy, if complex and somewhat troubled young man.</Review>
            <Review>The intimacy of debut writer-director Ryan Coogler's approach to the film and the no-frills, believably real quality of the main performances combine to drive the senselessness of Oscar's killing home with visceral impact.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director Ryan Coogler's [film is an] assured and evenhanded debut.</Review>
            <Review>It's an unflinching, 360-degree character portrait.</Review>
            <Review>It's hard not to watch Fruitvale Station with a coiled dread... Yet, Coogler's greatest achievement may be in reminding us that Grant was a work in progress with people who loved him in spite of his flaws and because of his hopes.</Review>
            <Review>You wonder if Coogler would have felt freer had Grant somehow lived that night, if the director weren't put in a position where he felt the need to honor the dead by bringing him to dramatic life. But he believes in his ambition.</Review>
            <Review>Michael B. Jordan and Octavia Spencer are particularly good in the film.</Review>
            <Review>Ryan Coogler's film is very sad and will make you cry, and maybe that's a good thing. I acknowledge it's important to devote time and care to such portrayals of abuse and injustice, and Coogler has certainly done that.</Review>
            <Review>It's a gentle film, with deep reservoirs of empathy and understanding. And so terribly sad.</Review>
            <Review>As well as being a superb piece of filmmaking and writing that tells an important story of what happened, it's also a thought-provoking tribute to what could have been.</Review>
            <Review>[Fruitvale Station] has a profound emotional impact by keeping things simple.</Review>
            <Review>Coogler's realistic debut recreates Grant's final day with affection, refusing to cast him as either saint or sinner.</Review>

            <Review>A thoughtful, intelligent examination of the US war on drugs.</Review>
            <Review>This zippy documentary by Matthew Cooke can't compare to Eugene Jarecki's tragic and masterful The House I Live In (2012).</Review>
            <Review>Highly entertaining and informative look at the war on drugs, offers a tongue-in-cheek manual of how to become a cartel leader. But it's not just a glib exercise &amp; confronts the implications of a drug policy that many would agree is a disaster.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately, the most frightening lesson the film teaches is just how dysfunctionally impervious to defeat the so-called war on drugs is ...</Review>
            <Review>It often works, despite in-your-face graphics that occasionally do the job of resembling cheesy sales pitches a little too well.</Review>
            <Review>"How to Make Money" is full of useful insights from people who know the drug trade well, including reformed dealers, ex-international smugglers, former cops, pundits, lawyers and government insiders.</Review>
            <Review>The subject matter is not always well served by the hammy, overcooked satirical treatment.</Review>
            <Review>It becomes a compelling, clear-sighted trip through the jungle; a documentary that rushes us in and then proceeds to point the way out.</Review>
            <Review>Persuasive, possessive and powerful, you'll feel like you've had a shot of nasal gold dust after just five minutes and the highs keep coming.</Review>
            <Review>Deploys lots of sans serif graphics and handy statistics to explain how people escalate up the drug-dealing ladder.</Review>

            <Review>Stylishly directed and sharply written, this is an entertaining, informative and frequently shocking documentary that reaches a number of depressing conclusions.</Review>

            <Review>Imagine Project X taking place in the world of Another Earth and you get +1. While there are interesting aspects within the film's sci-fi elements, it seems repressed thanks to so much emphasis being put on raunchy college behavior.</Review>
            <Review>One of those movies whose only chance of enduring is based on the word of mouth of those who have seen it, "+1" is a freaky jaunt through time travel that is well worth taking.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>84</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Throughout Richard Nixon's presidency, three of his top White House aides obsessively documented their experiences with Super 8 home movie cameras. Young, idealistic and dedicated, they had no idea that a few years later they'd all be in prison. This unique and personal visual record, created by H.R. Haldeman, John Ehrlichman and Dwight Chapin, was seized by the FBI during the Watergate investigation, then filed away and forgotten for almost 40 years. OUR NIXON is an all-archival documentary presenting those home movies for the first time, along with other rare footage, creating an intimate and complex portrait of the Nixon presidency as never seen before.

            <Review>At times Short Term 12 seems uncertain where it's going, but this matches the circumstances of both staff and residents.</Review>
            <Review>There's heart, soul and personality to burn in 'Short Term 12' ... But this is a film that, like many of its young characters, desperately needs to calm down.</Review>
            <Review>"Short Term 12" is a sly wonder of a film. It brings you into its unique world and then slowly reveals its characters, letting them unfold gradually, organically.</Review>
            <Review>It's one of the best movies of the year and one of the truest portrayals I've ever seen about troubled teens and the people who dedicate their lives to trying to help them.</Review>
            <Review>Cinematic without belying its "slice of life" vibe, emotionally enveloping without being saccharine, and wonderfully acted across the board.</Review>
            <Review>What could be a portrait of instability and institutional failings, however, becomes quite a moving story of the commitment of two counselors (Larson and John Gallagher Jr.) who came through the foster system themselves and take their jobs very seriously.</Review>

        <Title>I'm In Love With A Church Girl</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>119</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Cars. Good looks. Mansions. Money. Women. Miles Montego has it all. Including a past. He was king of the streets as a high-level drug trafficker, and although he has tried to move on, the DEA isn't convinced. Miles is still rolling with his old friends and colleagues, and the feds are certain he has not fully retired from his criminal past. When Miles meets Vanessa Leon, a woman who is different than every other woman he's met, he is drawn to her beauty and her faith. She is a "church girl" in every sense of the word. Increasingly, he is torn between a life that he knows and a love that he feels. As Vanessa experiences his lavish lifestyle, mobster-type friends, gun play, and encounters with past women, Vanessa must reconcile her faith in God and her growing love for Miles. Both are tested to their last ounce of faith and strength in God and each other. God continues to chip away at Miles through struggles from his past, having to live up to his reputation, feelings of unworthiness, the death of his mother, federal charges, his friends being indicted, the strain on his relationship with Vanessa, almost losing her in a near-fatal car accident, and finally the spiritual breakdown that brings him on his knees to face God one-on-one. I'M IN LOVE WITH A CHURCH GIRL is a powerful, inspiring story of a love between a man and a woman, a gift of second chances, and a family at home and in church that never stops praying and believing.(c) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>Even having God on the production team can't save this 'Church Girl' from its heavy-handed sermonizing.</Review>
            <Review>For myself and most folks expecting a movie, it is too transparent an infomercial for the church to move the mountain.</Review>
            <Review>This overlong drama plays like a threefold infomercial: for Christianity, the cheesy resort chain Sandals and Jeff "Ja Rule" Atkins, the rapper-turned-actor playing drug kingpin Miles Montego.</Review>
            <Review>A message film with the narrative sophistication of a recruiting pamphlet.</Review>
            <Review>Suffers from the same ills as too many movies that preach to the choir: a laborious length, formulaic plot and dialogue and, disappointing for a film that stars a rapper, a stock score.</Review>
            <Review>We're apparently supposed to root for these two to make it, although Vanessa is outlandishly jealous and pushy.</Review>
            <Review>Perhaps the problem with this work is it's trying very hard to make faith sexier than the Scarface lifestyle.</Review>
            <Review>Solid performances by Ja Rule and Adrienne Bailon combine with an inspirational story to make an enjoyable film.</Review>
            <Review>You won't believe a second of it.</Review>
            <Review>To call the acting amateurish does a disservice to hard-working amateurs everywhere.</Review>
            <Review>Drug dealer's conversion story appeals to faith audiences.</Review>
            <Review>For a religion started by a martyred egalitarian hippie who hung out with lepers and prostitutes and was executed by The Man, these supposed adherents sure seem obsessed with Earthly wealth. Bad movie, but a fascinating watch.</Review>

            <Review>Sam Rockwell is one of Hollywood's most underrated actors and he shows why that's the case again in A Single Shot, a rural, neo-noir thriller that slowly pulls the viewer under its veil of mystery.</Review>
            <Review>The back story disappoints less for its convoluted nature than for its failure to create a convincing set of motivations for its characters.</Review>

            <Review>Although overly dense and at times unfocused, "Gasland Part II" successfully continues Fox's crusade against the ill effects of natural gas.</Review>
            <Review>Fox is on to something. But he's on to too much of something, and that sprawl -- which takes him from Dimock, Pa., to Dish, Texas, to Hollywood, to Queensland, Australia, to the bayou, to Washington, D.C. -- tends to dilute the story he set out to tell.</Review>

            <Review>Enough Said is Nicole Holofcener's best yet - it's what we wanted from the new Bridget Jones book, a smart comedy about dating in your 50s.</Review>
            <Review>Enough Said is a romantic comedy about hurting the people you love, who you want to love - and making mistakes that may be impossible to recover from.</Review>
            <Review>In the terse space film provides, Holofcener capturing her characters deftly. We know their fears, needs, lonesomeness. We trust the cars they drive, the food they eat, the rooms they keep tidy, or not.</Review>
            <Review>What a concept -- an adult romantic comedy that's equally wise and playful, with mold-breaking performances by James Gandolfini and Julia Louis-Dreyfus.</Review>
            <Review>The easy chemistry between Louis-Dreyfus and Gandolfini is wonderfully charming - you're rooting for them even as the falsehoods pile up and the poison begins to flow.</Review>
            <Review>On its own, 'Enough Said' is a sweet and charming little movie - but there's no question the loss of its beloved leading man lends the picture extra, unexpected pathos.</Review>
            <Review>It's slightly magical. It's also just the art and craft of good acting; Julia Louis-Dreyfus, wonderful actress, James Gandolfini, wonderful actor. R.I.P. James. Enough Said.</Review>
            <Review>It wouldn't work if Gandolfini and Julia Louis-Dreyfus had not got on, but luckily theirs was a natural and sweet chemistry.</Review>
            <Review>It's a wonderful movie-funny, sad and wise about the crazy ways we torment ourselves in this thing called love.</Review>
            <Review>A slate of great performances cap off a compelling look at the way we build up and destroy the very relationships we want to engage in.</Review>
            <Review>How it all plays out, even without the unexpected layer of wistful Gandolfini remembrance, is sad and funny at the same time.</Review>

With infectious optimism, O'Brien and his team of eight undertook an unconventional approach and ambitious mission: Create a school with an arts-oriented curriculum that also emphasizes self-development, community collaboration and social change. Initially, the buzz from everyone was that this was a dream come true. But conflicts arose when untested idealism was challenged by long-standing realities far bigger than school.

        <Duration>90</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Portrait of Wally, Egon Schiele's tender picture of his mistress, Walburga ("Wally") Neuzil, is the pride of the Leopold Museum in Vienna. But for 13 years the painting was locked up in New York, caught in a legal battle between the Austrian museum and the Jewish family from whom the Nazis seized the painting in 1939. Portrait of Wally traces the history of this iconic image - from Schiele's gesture of affection toward his young lover, to the theft of the painting from Lea Bondi, a Jewish art dealer fleeing Vienna for her life, to the post-war confusion and subterfuge that evoke The Third Man, to the surprise resurfacing of "Wally" on loan to the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan in 1997. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>The real treat of Rewind This! is the geek-speak about VHS tapes telling uniquely distinct stories.</Review>
            <Review>Though VHS' best days may have come and gone, Rewind This! certainly proves the case for the technology's enduring legacy by speaking with those who were there to live through it and with those who continue to collect and sell tapes even today.</Review>
            <Review>A hilarious and utterly excellent look back at a time where movie collecting was more of a sport and treasure hunt than a matter of simple point and click.</Review>
            <Review>It's affectionate and educational, with enough visual evidence to act as a time machine, bringing viewers back to an era of movie-watching exploration and physical media worship.</Review>
            <Review>The film is elevated above the average 'these are a few of my favourite things' documentary by its willingness to take on larger narratives around the social, economic and literary significance of the genre, all in a fully accessible way.</Review>
            <Review>a fascinating, funny and focused journey through our recent - and rapidly changing - cultural memory, lest we forget.</Review>
            <Review>The film is ultimately less interested in giving an objective overview of VHS' history than in paying loving, irreverent tribute to some of the strange subcultures that sprung up in the home-video world.</Review>
            <Review>This unabashedly nostalgic doc serves as a potent reminder of VHS' pivotal role in the history of entertainment, even if we've all moved on now. Well, most of us.</Review>
            <Review>Even if you grew up during the VHS era, you may never have connected the dots between the format's '80s home invasion and the entertainment marketplace we live in now -- an evolution Rewind This! traces in fascinating fashion.</Review>

            <Review>So slapped together it feels less like a movie than an extended montage...</Review>
            <Review>If you're hoping for intricate plotting, suspense or even nominal character development, StreetDance 2 is unlikely to waltz away with your heart.</Review>
            <Review>Boutella shows promise beyond her day job as one of Madonna's dancers but otherwise speaking parts are sensibly limited to those who can act.</Review>
            <Review>Sexier dance sequel light on plot but heavy on dancing.</Review>
            <Review>When the provocative rhythms of Latin fuse with funky street-dancing, the result is sexy, visceral and exciting. Sofia Boutella is a sensation; watching her dance is sure to drive young men to distraction.</Review>

            <Review>Like almost all dance films, Streetdance 2 has failed to find extremely talented dancers who are also even remotely credible actors.</Review>
            <Review>All the sentiments about 'being all you can be' fall somewhat flat against the cynically commercial feel of StreetDance 2's enterprise, which credits the audience with one brain-cell each.</Review>
            <Review>It's cornier than a field full of maize, of course, but its lack of scrappy charm renders it so tedious...</Review>
            <Review>The 3D is moderately imaginative...</Review>
            <Review>As a piece of catchy pop culture, the StreetDance franchise has a natural buzz - just don't expect much more than awesome moves for your money.</Review>

        <StoryLine>"It's Better to Jump" is about the ancient walled city of Akka in northern Israel, inhabited by Muslims, Christians, Jews, and Baha'i. But its history goes all the way back to rule of the Egyptian Pharaohs. As Akka undergoes harsh economic pressures and vast social change, the present-day situation is causing Arab families to leave the places where they have grown roots for dozens of generations and shaped a rich culture for over a thousand years. This film focuses on the aspirations and concerns of the Palestinian inhabitants who call the Old City home. (c) Official site</StoryLine>

            <Review>Ignore the one obviously Zionist "rotten" below. This is a terrific documentary about the resistance to a vulgar and soulless gentrification of a beautiful and historic old city. The story of Zionist brutality in a microcosm.</Review>
            <Review>The subject is the cultural cannibalization of one of the world's most ancient and beautiful cities, and however one-sided the argument is here, the problem is undeniably moving and true.</Review>
            <Review>A startling documentary about life in Acre, an Israeli city on the sea filled with unhappy Palestinians who have lived there for generations.</Review>

        <Title>Birth Of The Living Dead</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>76</Duration>
        <StoryLine>n 1968 a young college drop-out and aspiring filmmaker named George A. Romero directed Night of the Living Dead, a low-budget horror film that shocked the world, became an icon of the counterculture, and invented the modern movie zombie, which has spawned legions of films, books, comics, and video games, generating billions of dollars. Night of the Living Dead is not only internationally recognized as an art film, revered for its groundbreaking treatment of American race relations and allegorical references to the Vietnam war, the film still maintains its cult status as a classic horror masterpiece. The film made history when it simultaneously screened at MOMA and the notorious grind-house theater circuit on 42nd Street. Since its release Night of the Living Dead has been selected for preservation by the Library of Congress and the National Film Registry. Rob Kuhns' feature documentary BIRTH OF THE LIVING DEAD goes beyond just being a tribute to director George Romero's work, to explore a critical moment in the American experience and the notion that horror acts as a reflection of national anxiety. The film details how Romero gathered an unlikely team of real Pittsburgh citizens -- police officers, iron workers, teachers, housewives and a roller-rink owner -- to shoot in a revolutionary guerrilla style that became a cinematic landmark and one of the most visceral and influential horror films ever made.(c) First Run</StoryLine>

            <Review>Basically a glamorized DVD extra, but it entertains.</Review>
            <Review>Fans won't learn much from it that they didn't already know.</Review>
            <Review>Mr. Romero, manifesting a self-effacing demeanor and sensible humanity, is a most agreeable raconteur.</Review>
            <Review>Kuhns makes time for political insights, provocative montages of race riots cut with the movie's hick militia, and the comments of owlish Romero himself, who recounts the shoot like the enthusiastic 27-year-old he was.</Review>
            <Review>What distinguishes this doc from much of the tedious critical prose Romero has inspired is the fan-boy and fan-girl ardor that fuels its smarts - both behind and in front of the camera.</Review>
            <Review>Rob Kuhns's amusing but perfunctory documentary about the origins of the 1968 ur-text of zombiedom, George Romero's "Night of the Living Dead."</Review>
            <Review>Viewers will feel most rewarded by Kuhns' dissecting of Night's production, which provides a colorful and inspiring portrait of guerrilla filmmaking from a pre-digital era.</Review>
            <Review>Birth of the Living Dead does not uproot the order of behind-the-scenes documentaries, but the great likelihood that this film will send viewers right back to Romero's original with eyes reopened is a mark of its considerable success.</Review>
            <Review>Stands as a firm and very convincing argument that Night of the Living Dead (1968) is among the most important and influential films of all time.</Review>
            <Review>A reminder that this zombie flick was as much a product of its time as "Easy Rider" or "The Graduate".</Review>
            <Review>Sweet and simple, Birth of the Living Dead is a nostalgic, informative trip back to the origins of the modern zombie, featuring a George A. Romero who is as spry and entertaining as ever.</Review>
            <Review>What works here is enthusiasm, enjoying a wealth of appreciation presented to a worthy production, reinforcing its status as a groundbreaking picture that reverberates to this day.</Review>

The stories of legend are true, and the magical relics owned by such celebrated figures as Cinderella really exist. The malevolent force known as The Krugen knows well that the owner of these objects will reap ultimate power, because by obtaining the magical mirror once owned by the Evil Queen who tormented Snow White, they were able to herald the arrival of the Dark Ages. Centuries later, former Hunter Mason has become a loyal servant of The Krugen. He knows that once he locates all of the pieces of the mirror no one will be able to challenge his evil reign. But Jordyn and Carter Flynn hail from a long line of Hunters, and they've got just the skills to prevent Mason from achieving his diabolical plan. When Jordyn and Carter learn that their parents have gone missing during an important mission, they vow to track them down, and head off a disaster that could alter the entire course of history. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>The cross-cultural rom com about a Korean American's search for true love is marred by serious overacting, broad characterization, flat comedic skits. It tries too hard, like a comic who's the one laughing hardest at his jokes.</Review>

            <Review>Writer-director Christina Yoo has fashioned a film that can only be described as somewhat bizarre in its mash-up of American and Korean rom-com tropes.</Review>
            <Review>A fresh and very funny look at the romantic comedy through the Korean-American lens.</Review>
            <Review>Yoo's broadly drawn characters are less ha-ha funny than endearingly over-the-top, their exaggerated mannerisms rooted in fondness as much as mockery.</Review>

            <Review>Reich is a natural teacher of complex concepts: The film doesn't feel like homework.</Review>
            <Review>Inequality for All is intelligent, persuasive and accessible, a gentle but urgent clarion call to action.</Review>
            <Review>Overall, this film is enlightening, entertaining and seriously alarming.</Review>
            <Review>This documentary would be a rousing David and Goliath story even if its hero weren't the diminutive Robert B. Reich.</Review>
            <Review>President Clinton's secretary of labor lectures on income inequality with a refreshing lack of jargon.</Review>
            <Review>That a documentary about economics could be so personally emotional and affecting is remarkable. And to learn from Reich in this film, as his students at Berkeley do, is a treat and a privilege.</Review>
            <Review>Engaging economics docu encourages equality, activism.</Review>
            <Review>A levelheaded, easily understandable primer on the aspects and causes of the problem. However, it does not do much to distinguish itself from similar documentaries.</Review>
            <Review>Former Clinton Cabinet member Robert Reich makes his case for a kindler, gentler capitalism.</Review>
            <Review>Documentaries about the economy being what they are, you might not expect much from Inequality For All, but as directed by Jacob Kornbluth, it is the Indianapolis 500 of wealth analyses.</Review>
            <Review>America is a country without any "self-admitted proletarians," where even the poorest see themselves as "temporarily embarrassed" millionaires.</Review>
            <Review>Topical documentaries mostly appeal to the converted and are ignored by those who disagree. And "Inequality" probably will be no exception.</Review>

        <StoryLine>A young Brooklyn couple whose relationship is on the rocks heads upstate to a remote B&amp;B to work things out. The plan is ill conceived from the start. Arriving at The Happy House, they soon begin to suspect they've wandered into a real life horror movie. From there events go from weird to terrifying as they contend with the house's batty owner, her imposing son, a moody Swedish lepidopterist, a pedantic English professor, an extraordinarily rare butterfly, the world's best blueberry muffins, a .44 Magnum, a demented serial killer, and one very strict rulebook.

            <Review>The only surprises in D.W. Young's tiny low-budget debut are how mildly he satirizes this thinnest of genres and how sincerely he treats his clichéd characters.</Review>
            <Review>Wonderfully droll horror comedy with a memorably weird cast of characters.</Review>
            <Review>"The Happy House" is nothing if not a fresh mixture of colorful characters, questionable manners, and rusty, suddenly-new-again horror conventions.</Review>
            <Review>D.W. Young navigates his varying moods with an ease that's particularly impressive for a director making his feature debut, but he never capitalizes on his ability to coax down our guard.</Review>

            <Review>Thanks for Sharing might best be described as being like Steve McQueen's sex-addiction drama, Shame, if it were rewritten by Neil Simon at his most schmaltzy.</Review>
            <Review>It's frankly exhausting to keep up with these neurotic over-sharers, who are neither serious enough to care about nor humorous enough to laugh at.</Review>
            <Review>At least most of the cast is appealing, with Mark Ruffalo, Gwyneth Paltrow, Josh Gad, and Alecia Moore (better known as pop singer Pink) delivering the uninspired dialogue with relative finesse.</Review>
            <Review>Be warned: viewers may experience a violent urge to shake the characters, one by one, and tell them to get a life.</Review>
            <Review>After the bleak brilliance of 'Shame,' this is an almost sunny look at sexual addiction. Almost.</Review>
            <Review>Thanks for Sharing is never quite crazy or funny enough to transcend its "disease-of-month" template.</Review>
            <Review>[W]hen addressing taboo topics, convention is our friend, and this film uses its well-worn genre as a comfortable space for discussion.</Review>
            <Review>You get a very talented ensemble, but the material just isn't strong enough, leading to a lot of star power, but no staying power.</Review>
            <Review>Writer/director Stuart Blumberg got me to care about the characters and their fate to a degree all too rare in medium-sized American dramas.</Review>
            <Review>A likeable, well-meaning muddle of a movie, Thanks For Sharing takes the light road through the serious sex addiction of three New Yorkers.</Review>
            <Review>This self-conscious oddity can't decide whether it wants to be an indie-earnest reappraisal of the rigours of chronic dependency, or a slightly racy romcom with a saucy topical edge.</Review>
            <Review>Wildly inconsistent in tone, it is impossible to know whether the film aspires to comedy; it's certainly not funny.</Review>

            <Review>Definitely not your standard doc, this is something special ... a captivating journey through a landscape of mystery and imagination.</Review>
            <Review>Steel often succeeds in conjuring a contemplative trance, which is especially impressive given the arcane subject matter.</Review>
            <Review>Impressionistic animation illustrates the beauty Boyd created...Megan herself comes off as some kind of fabled creature, never seen, but always admired and respected.</Review>
            <Review>The lazy structure, lack of narrative drive or visual stimulus quickly reveal the reasons that Boyd's life hasn't been tackled cinematically before.</Review>
            <Review>With its lyrical blend of atmospheric Highland footage and expressionist animation, this is much more than a documentary about the dying art of hand-fashioned fishing hooks.</Review>
            <Review>Steel uses animation, crispy cinematography and interviews with Boyd's protégés and friends to chart the depths of this one-of-a-kind businesswoman.</Review>
            <Review>What seems at first an impossibly flimsy and meagre documentary subject slowly reveals itself as cine-miniaturism with charm.</Review>
            <Review>It makes fishing look an Edenic pastime, with Boyd's iridescent feather/fur/hair creations proving that in a prelapsarian world even salmon can have the fine or fatal sensibility of art connoisseurs.</Review>
            <Review>It's a small film, but a quietly affecting one as well.</Review>
            <Review>This is the story of an odd life, and a degree of oddness in its telling is desirable.</Review>
            <Review>Deploys talking heads, dreamy animations and lyrical music to trace the arc of Boyd's life and mount a poetic, poignant tribute to the seductive mystique of a rarefied craft.</Review>

            <Review>A dreary and derivative thriller that is nowhere near as smart or controversial as it clearly believes itself to be.</Review>
            <Review>There are enough genuine moments of surprise to make this genre exercise an invigorating one.</Review>
            <Review>Sharp ensemble work ups this thriller's intelligence quotient.</Review>
            <Review>The lawyers are supposed to be former lovers, but the film doesn't allow the leads to display any chemistry; likewise, it doesn't generate any suspense from its tried-and-true conspiracy premise.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is low-key but each scene is packed with information. Full understanding demands full attention.</Review>
            <Review>Everything does work harmoniously for the majority of Closed Circuit, to create the exact taut mystery of governmental corruption and legal system loopholes I desired.</Review>
            <Review>The progressively intriguing atmosphere is heightened by the inclusion of several standout sequences...</Review>
            <Review>The film's attempts to expose flaws in the criminal justice system or give insights into the war against terror seem superficial, but Closed Circuit is entertaining in a sub-Hitchcock way.</Review>
            <Review>I think this moves at a rapid pace. I think it has got really good performances.</Review>
            <Review>This is a genre I usually enjoy and while CLOSED CIRCUIT has some shortcomings it's a thought-provoking thriller.</Review>
            <Review>Layered with strongly crafted characters, and snaking thriller plot, the results are compelling, thought provoking, and highly entertaining.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Sriram Venkat (Imran Khan) is the most shallow guy on earth who doesn't value relationships, family, friends, life or the country. Not necessarily in that order. Because he couldn't care less about the order. This makes him the clear 'black' sheep of the family. At some point this shallow man begins to narrate the story of the crazy relationship he shared with Dia Sharma (Kareena Kapoor). His ex girlfriend. A firebrand social activist who wanted to change the world. An attraction which was physical initially but then got emotional and finally veered into complex territories resulting in a clash of ideologies and mindsets which drove them apart. Bitterly. Sriram believed that charity begins and ends at home. Whilst Dia felt that you have to be the change that you want to bring about. However Sriram realizes that he is not over Dia and still loves her and that she is the best change that ever happened... and will happen to his life. (C) Reliance</StoryLine>

            <Review>Linsanity offers lots for b-ball fans, but also has a higher purpose.</Review>
            <Review>At age 25, the likable and surprisingly humble Lin has so little career behind him and, his fans hope, so much more ahead, that his onscreen soul searching about lost opportunities and early missed dreams rings hollow.</Review>
            <Review>A little game footage can go a long way; and a lot of game footage, no matter how good, goes a very long way.</Review>
            <Review>As a piece of filmmaking, Linsanity is scattershot and too reliant on newsreels. And the interviews, most of all with the religiously devout Lin are, alas, fairly unrevealing.</Review>
            <Review>Leong's film isn't particularly stylish, but it makes the most of the climactic Knicks footage, as well as showcasing a sweetly goofy side of the 25-year-old ...</Review>
            <Review>You may have watched Lin's rise to national prominence the first time, but it's still easy to get caught up in the moment.</Review>
            <Review>A moving biopic about a humble underdog who surmounted overwhelming odds with the help of family, friends and a strong faith.</Review>
            <Review>Not just for the fans, the doc presents an entertaining and thoughtful story of racial minded America and the effect it has had on the struggle and the success of Jeremy Lin.</Review>
            <Review>If you're a fan of Jeremy Lin, it's unlikely to tell you anything you don't already know, though it may give you a few new moments over which you can coo, "Aw, look at him! Isn't he just a great person?"</Review>
            <Review>Thoughtful sports docu will inspire young basketball fans.</Review>
            <Review>It's pretty much just trekking through the territory that got written up in all those game day reviews.</Review>
            <Review>Doesn't really do anything too unorthodox, but the production values are stellar, and this wouldn't feel especially out of place as a 30 for 30</Review>

Yet once the guests begin to arrive, more complications ensue than either of them could have ever imagined - even if they did know their wedding was bullshit. (c) Oscilloscope</StoryLine>

            <Review>"Breakup at a Wedding'' works, because Quinaz has come up with a concept that lets him skewer directorial pretension alongside wedding hysteria.</Review>
            <Review>If you're the kind who is always up for a calamity-filled trip down the aisle, "Breakup at a Wedding" is a moderately amusing application of the formula.</Review>
            <Review>Any rooting interest in the central lovers evaporates, as both seem so terminally stupid that the thought of them potentially having children together is frightening.</Review>
            <Review>Quinaz shot the film days before his own wedding, and perhaps that explains Breakup's soft, squishy heart: It can't help but melt.</Review>
            <Review>Yes, the whole enterprise is parody, but there remains a welcome streak of humanity to cut deep across the middle of what is an otherwise debauchery-filled romp.</Review>
            <Review>I was pleased enough with Breakup At A Wedding, pleased with its ambition, its execution, even its stylistic conceit. Not exactly high praise, perhaps, but I think the film achieves what it sets out to do, and does so admirably.</Review>

            <Review>It's not particularly congruent, but thanks to two terrific performances and director Logan Miller's determination to make his own kind of music, Sweetwater packs one hell of a punch.</Review>
            <Review>The west has never been less gritty, less pulpy than it is here, with the locale fading into the background when it should be a character in its own right.</Review>
            <Review>Sarah's would-be parade of vengeance makes for a bloody but bland reckoning.</Review>
            <Review>An excellent cast and the film's authentic period look help transport us back to 1880s New Mexico while watching a very angry woman out for revenge.</Review>
            <Review>There isn't much insight into religious fanaticism or gender politics from the era, but the showdowns pack a punch.</Review>
            <Review>The Millers work known elements with flair, and their commitment to character is invigorating, making the eventual slide into bloodlust ripple with personality.</Review>

            <Review>This sentimental Michael Caine drama is so dull that doctors could prescribe it to treat insomnia.</Review>
            <Review>This is a glacially paced movie, filled with sickly picture postcard imagery that seems designed to put you to sleep.</Review>
            <Review>This somber work about the worthiness of living has little life in it.</Review>
            <Review>"Last Love" starts out promising enough, but alas, it doesn't last.</Review>
            <Review>This dull, dawdling film, adapted from Françoise Dorner's novel "La Douceur Assassine," eventually succumbs to sentimentality.</Review>
            <Review>Not much happens in Sandra Nettelbeck's intimate family drama, but its well-drawn connections between lonely souls make an impact nonetheless.</Review>
            <Review>It's Caine who shines brightest with his gentle anger and newfound joy mixing into a bittersweet reconciliatory release.</Review>
            <Review>Caine's brave attempt to speak pigeon French with an American accent produces some unintentionally comedic moments. Every time he says 'Merci', for example, you'll think he's spotted a horse. As in "mare, see!"</Review>
            <Review>Sir Michael Caine is London personified, a British movie icon with one of the most distinctive voices in cinema. So why on earth would you mis-cast him as an American in Paris with a totally implausible accent?</Review>

He heads to a small Louisiana town to start filming when production funding suddenly dries up. With no other options, Osric agrees to take up southern matron Hester Beauchamp's offer to finance his movie, as long as he throws some zombies into the film to attract a wider audience. When Hester suddenly dies mid-shoot -- and with the local sheriff and ambitious news reporter Shine Reynolds hot on his trail -- Osric is thrust into one precarious and hilarious situation after another in a desperate attempt to keep ZOMBIE HAMLET alive.

            <Review>It soon becomes apparent that the filmmakers, many of whom worked together on "The State" and "Reno 911!", aren't committed to their film's main conceit.</Review>
            <Review>The film's reliance on female nudity for edge seems approximately as ancient as the withered hag who keeps trying to get it on with Corddry.</Review>
            <Review>[It] rarely dares to be smart, settling instead for familiar gags that would have the Devil himself yawning.</Review>
            <Review>A film that's less than half as funny as its predecessor, and a sliver as clever as the original.</Review>
            <Review>This offensive, crass pastiche makes "Grown Ups 2" look like a paragon of wit and good taste.</Review>
            <Review>There are genre satires, and then there are dumb comedies that wish they could qualify for that status.</Review>
            <Review>A slog through improv run amok -- a film that seems allergic toward anything that might be construed as a legitimate throughline, lest that somehow be interpreted as 'selling out,' and not subversive enough.</Review>
            <Review>Hell Baby offers a welcome alternative to the overwrought seriousness of modern horror movies with its frequently hilarious take on familiar genre tropes.</Review>
            <Review>This is just about the one-billionth movie to lampoon the horror genre, but so what? It's hilarious.</Review>
            <Review>Given the talent involved, it's a project that sounds promising (if maybe more than slightly derivative), but it winds up an unfortunate misfire.</Review>
            <Review>The jaw drops at the drought of laughs in the horror spoof "Hell Baby," especially considering the massive amount of comic talent in front of and behind the cameras.</Review>

            <Review>Joseph Gordon-Levitt turns the gym-tan-laundry routine into an art form with Don Jon, his vibrant and viciously profane directorial debut.</Review>
            <Review>Offbeat, frank and often surprising gem.</Review>
            <Review>The movie becomes increasingly soft-edged and sappy.</Review>
            <Review>Joseph Gordon-Levitt's debut as a writer-director-actor resembles a porn addict's Groundhog Day, and not in a good way.</Review>
            <Review>At least 80% of it is snappy, droll fluff, while the other 20% is what you get when you persuade Julianne Moore to be in your movie: in a word, better.</Review>
            <Review>He's got a good ear for guy-talk dialogue, and a welcome sense of candor-he's putting some stuff out there about guys and porn. As a director, he's got a keen visual wit; the film has a fast, popping montage style that recalls early Aronofsky.</Review>
            <Review>In terms of disposable, enjoyable entertainment, you could do much worse than this.</Review>
            <Review>In this raunchy, foul-mouthed and candid comedy about male narcissism, Gordon-Levitt _ perhaps best remembered as Leonardo DiCaprio's sidekick in Inception _ gives us a sure-footed directorial debut.</Review>
            <Review>The only trouble with Don Jon is the film's comfort level with the kind of material that holds its hero enslaved.</Review>
            <Review>There's just enough charm and poignancy here to make it worth a watch. Not a bad start for any first-time filmmaker.</Review>
            <Review>A barn-door broad burlesque of Joisey stereotypes and holy-cannoli accents. It's Saturday Night Fever drawn in crayon.</Review>

            <Review>If you really want to remember those times? Get out "Horses." Or "Talking Heads: 77." Or "Blank Generation." Preferably on vinyl, with all the pops and scratches. And play them. Loud.</Review>
            <Review>I would swear on a stack of Dead Boys T-shirts and a first pressing of Richard Hell and the Voidoids' "Blank Generation" that it could not possibly have been like that: so silly, so trivial, so boring.</Review>
            <Review>In place of punk's howling rage, you get gross-out jokes that include at least a half-dozen close-ups of the poop from Kristal's bowel-challenged dog.</Review>
            <Review>With nonexistent character depth, abysmal storytelling, and an aesthetic gimmick that hurts the film far more than it helps, all CBGB only benefits from a killer soundtrack.</Review>
            <Review>You figure a movie that features the Ramones and Blondie would be so extraordinary and energetic, but "CBGB" makes them seem so mundane and unimportant.</Review>
            <Review>Plays like it was written and directed by people who have never listened to or heard of punk rock in their lives</Review>
            <Review>Under Rickman's pained gaze you wonder what he saw in the music, although when you hear it... it does take you back. There's something there, but CBGB isn't it.</Review>
            <Review>It's '24 Hour Party People' without the wit and definitely without the love of the music it pretends to lionize.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately, CBGB tries to be too cute of a film about a great, gritty topic, but for those seeking an innocent trip through a pivotal time in rock, it's better than a kick in the head.</Review>

            <Review>This eager film piles on common fears: evil puppetry, haunted homes and overly generous hosts. So despite a sloppy and humorless execution, it is scary by association.</Review>
            <Review>"Cassadaga" tries to scoop up enough tropes to satisfy a wide range of potential fright fans but lacks the cohesion to ever truly be effective.</Review>
            <Review>This silly throwback to the post-'Psycho' shockers of the '60s offers a sluggish giallo-like murder mystery spiked with grotesque sadism.</Review>
            <Review>Attempts to leverage the horror genre in the service of inducing epiphanies, but keeps tripping over its confused tangle of genres.</Review>
            <Review>A hodge-podge of horror tropes that frequently congeals into something fun.</Review>
            <Review>Watching the opening moments of the new independent horror movie 'Cassadaga,' you might be forgiven for assuming the word is medical jargon for "self-administered impulse penectomy.'</Review>
            <Review>Cassadaga is so close to being hauntingly endearing, but an overly "Hallmark" feel and laughable serial killer destroy any excitement or pleasure genre fans might be teased with.</Review>
            <Review>Cassadaga flirts with conventions of both paranormal horror films and more traditional serial killer thrillers, but is marked by listless characters and indistinct dialogue.</Review>
            <Review>...cribs equally from "Ghost Whisperer"-like spiritual melodrama, ghostly mystery, and grisly torture porn.</Review>

        <Duration>105</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Based on the recent book, Fragments: Poems, Intimate Notes, Letters, edited by Farrar, Straus and Giroux, October 2010, Fragments: Marilyn Monroe, explores the unknown side of Monroe "a deeply curious artist, a savvy businessperson" and challenges the long-held misperception of Marilyn as the dumb blonde archetype. Alongside interviews with experts and former acquaintances, A-list actors read from Marilyn's own writings, bringing her words to a contemporary audience for the first time.

            <Review>Do any fresh revelations or insights remain, a half century past Monroe's overdose death at age 36?</Review>
            <Review>A heartfelt and well-intentioned love letter to an already deeply beloved star, and for anyone who's still not convinced, the picture works hard to make the case for Monroe's gifts as an actress.</Review>
            <Review>Monroe's vulnerability and sense of inadequacy, her frustration and solitude, come through poignantly.</Review>
            <Review>It was a mistake to ask anyone to dramatically read a chicken recipe Monroe prepared for Joe DiMaggio (one of her husbands), or some of the other scribbles included here.</Review>
            <Review>Given the number of Marilyn memorials already out there, this is just another pleasant, un-revelatory way to say goodbye Norma Jean.</Review>
            <Review>Monroe's writing is beautifully succinct, but the cast deliver it with such mannered intensity that it comes across like the worst of Monroe's performances ...</Review>
            <Review>If not quite on the level of Garbus's terrific Bobby Fischer documentary, this is still filled with fond recollections of Mazza's life and career. Fans will relish it.</Review>
            <Review>It doesn't provide blinding new insight into Monroe's life but it is filled with less familiar newsreel footage and decent movie clips and has some brief, invaluable glimpses of a troubled inner life.</Review>
            <Review>Garbus is able to re-stitch Monroe's life in a most compelling and original manner.</Review>
            <Review>By the end of the film, we learn just about everything about Monroe was self-created, which somehow makes the eventual self-destruction a little more understandable, and her life story a cautionary meditation on the booby-traps of celebrity.</Review>

            <Review>The true story of Ward Allen, a man whose life was not interesting enough to be the basis for a film.</Review>
            <Review>Despite some fine performances, the film has difficulty finding a consistent tone, and the well-intentioned script emphasizes melodrama and sentimentality.</Review>

            <Review>Despite smatterings of wit and a stable of skilled performers, "C.O.G." struggles to find a consistent tone, its episodic structure veering from farcical to poignant to dangerously raw.</Review>

            <Review>The film features snappy, hilarious bits among the coming-of-age vignettes, but it loses momentum as it winds toward a finish. You won't grow bored with the characters, but you might check your watch a few times.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>76</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Winner of the Golden Bear at the Berlinale, Paolo and Vittorio Taviani's Caesar Must Die deftly melds narrative and documentary in a transcendently powerful drama-within-a-drama. The film was made in Rome's Rebibbia Prison, where the inmates are preparing to stage Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. After a competitive casting process, the roles are eventually allocated, and the prisoners begin exploring the text, finding in its tale of fraternity, power and betrayal parallels to their own lives and stories. Hardened criminals, many with links to organised crime, these actors find great motivation in performing the play. As we witness the rehearsals, beautifully photographed in various nooks and crannies within the prison, we see the inmates also work through their own conflicts, both internal and between each other. -- (C) Adopt</StoryLine>

            <Review>It is almost an impertinence to think that we understand the thoughts of these actors and those in the audience who are relatives and friends. But this is the intriguing privilege that the Taviani brothers have given us.</Review>
            <Review>A film somewhere between documentary and neo-realist drama.</Review>
            <Review>There's barely a wasted moment in the film, which runs a brisk 76 minutes and contains no female roles.</Review>
            <Review>There's an intensity and emotional accuracy to the performances that's just stunning, particularly Striano's Brutus, as he longs for death and release.</Review>
            <Review>It's an arresting, playful and moving film ...</Review>
            <Review>Prison theatricals are nothing new in the movies, but Caesar Must Die, a quasi-documentary featuring hardened convicts acting out Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, is in a class by itself.</Review>
            <Review>The most gripping and brilliant Shakespeare production put on film since Laurence Olivier's Hamlet.</Review>
            <Review>A double hybrid that occupies a space somewhere between documentary and fiction right along the border of cinema and theater.</Review>
            <Review>A clever if sometimes mystifying, combination of documentary, invention and post-modernism.</Review>
            <Review>Destined to lose years in prison, the actors seem to take pride -- and solace -- in their association with something as seemingly immortal as Shakespeare's words.</Review>
            <Review>As they find issues and themes they can relate to, the action is never remotely static despite the frequent nature of the close-ups and the plastic sword.</Review>
            <Review>The problem with the film, which somewhat inexplicably won the Golden Bear at Berlin last year, is that it scarcely transcends the basic novelty of its premise.</Review>

            <Review>There is something sharp, exciting and more original tucked within "The Berlin File" - and it is in moments a sleek, crackling film - but it all feels somehow misshapen.</Review>
            <Review>As soon as "The Berlin File" takes flight with its exhilarating action set pieces, memories of any muddles evaporate amid the tension and vivid engagement with settings, from courtyards to fields.</Review>
            <Review>The Berlin File benefits from gritty surroundings that add a cold war realism to this otherwise confusing tale of conflicted loyalties and secret agendas.</Review>
            <Review>The story feels fairly perfunctory - not to mention unnecessarily knotty - but the well-connected leads do their best to ground it.</Review>
            <Review>[A] formulaic but solid Cold War-style spy thriller, with North Korea pinch-hitting for the Soviet Union.</Review>
            <Review>Everything here, except the action scenes, [feels] sluggish and rote.</Review>
            <Review>Even though there's moments of exciting action and the reassembling of a government hierarchy violently taking place in front of you, The Berlin File is strapped to its restraints by its slow, meandering pace.</Review>
            <Review>Retrospectively cold war in tone this provides action more brutal than balletic and the promise of a Bourne-style franchise in the making.</Review>
            <Review>The movie offers just about all you could ask of a genre flick: poisonings, defections, a secret North Korean bank account, gloriously choreographed fights that go insanely over the top, febrile tension and doomy romance (but no sex).</Review>
            <Review>'The Berlin File' takes Hollywood's penchant for spectacle and ADD visual neurosis to its logical albeit absurd conclusion.</Review>
            <Review>A sporadically entertaining, modestly ambitious shoot 'em up that frequently succumbs to spelling out its subtext.</Review>
            <Review>The plot may be a challenge to figure out, but this crisply directed spy thriller from Korea holds your attention through its overall smooth professionalism.</Review>

            <Review>Imhoof's film is remarkable in its close-up photography. The bees loom large, like creatures from some mutant planet; dangle together in a delicate chain; and fill the air, floating like unusually vivid dust specks.</Review>

            <Review>More Than Honey is a phenomenally well-researched and thorough study of bees and their complex influence on human civilization, and an in depth investigation of the honeybee colony collapse disorder.</Review>

            <Review>Most of [Wan's] peers shoot a bunch of scenes and let the editor make a smoothie. Wan no longer relies on visual gibberish. He has become a classicist in that sense.</Review>

            <Review>Insidious: Chapter 2 is a puzzle movie with too many unnecessary pieces and not enough essential ones, but it's superior to its predecessor in a few basic ways.</Review>
            <Review>Though there's some admirably clever plotting to interweave the film's second half with events in the original, it's simply not as scary.</Review>
            <Review>Insidious: Chapter 2 is not only unnecessary but it commits the cardinal sin of devaluing its predecessor.</Review>
            <Review>An increasing amount of metaphysical backtracking dilutes the few simple jolts that do work this time around.</Review>
            <Review>It's the screenplay's salient collision of past and present that sets the film apart from most horror sequels.</Review>
            <Review>The movie isn't merely bad, it's incompetent.</Review>
            <Review>If we had to have a sequel, "Chapter 2" is a really good one.</Review>
            <Review>Not much that's new (hey, it's a sequel) but there's still an old-fashioned respect for the pleasures of simple creepiness.</Review>
            <Review>It's not gory, but relies on ceaseless weirdness with scores of jump scares and even an odd Back To The Future 2-style subplot that's undeveloped yet still adds to the overall sense of crazy. Love or hate it, this is pretty effective modern scare cinema.</Review>
            <Review>The best horror films stay with you, leaving you jumping at the slightest sounds. This is decidedly not that kind of movie.</Review>

            <Review>Mulloy's camera is fully alive to the geographical possibilities of her location, hustling after the hustlers, pausing for a shot of a caged bird or a nightclub singer. It's quite a stew.</Review>
            <Review>[Mulloy] brings a documentarian's objective eye to "Una Noche," yet the actors - non-professionals - convey exactly the emotions she is looking for.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director Lucy Mulloy displays much promise in her first feature, a gritty teen drama shot in Havana with a nonprofessional cast.</Review>
            <Review>Despite the bleak-ness of the situation, the film vibrates with color, noise, music, ferocious arguments (both serious and teasing), and eye-catching snapshots of everyday life in Havana.</Review>
            <Review>Una noche thrums with the vibrant energy of restless youth taking their fates into their own hands.</Review>
            <Review>This trio of actors-probably not too far removed from the plight of their characters-renders each and every second with the utmost credibility.</Review>
            <Review>unforgettable portrait of Havana--away from the tourist haunts and into its back streets</Review>
            <Review>Not only a portrait of the frustrations and yearnings of Cuban youth, but a universally relevant one of any people striving for more and better than their current stifling existences.</Review>
            <Review>(Mulloy shows) a genuine sense of empathy for her yearning, troubled characters and an artist's eye for the beauty of decay.</Review>
            <Review>Augmenting the film's evocative visuals are the phenomenal performances courtesy of its three leads, all of whom are first time, non-professional actors.</Review>
            <Review>Molloy captures the Cuban spirit of energy, resiliency, resourcefulness, and passion. She does an impressive job of blending an intimate story of friends with a meticulously observed portrait of Havana.</Review>

            <Review>Depp has done the kooky, costumed character shtick so many times, it's no longer surprising to see him bury his index finger into the desert sand, then lick it</Review>
            <Review>Frustrating, lazy and lifeless.</Review>
            <Review>Your expectations of how bad The Lone Ranger is can't trump the reality.</Review>
            <Review>It's as obsessive and overbearing as Steven Spielberg's "1941"-and, I'll bet, as likely to be re-evaluated twenty years from now, and described as "misunderstood."</Review>
            <Review>Somewhere, around the hour-and-a-half mark, The Lone Ranger makes the fateful decision not to end. Worse, the movie keeps not-ending for another full hour.</Review>
            <Review>The Lone Ranger is a weird mixture of daffy slapstick and deadly seriousness.</Review>
            <Review>Verbinski delivers a delirious final action sequence that transforms the movie from timid to full-bodied and rousing, but it's too little, too late.</Review>
            <Review>You thought, 'Wow! Another cool, Jack Sparrow-type makeup job-check out the dead crow on his head!' All one can say of 'The Lone Ranger': what a waste of an excellent costume.</Review>
            <Review>In short, the "spirit guide" of this film would be an odious trash heap.</Review>
            <Review>If 1999's "Wild Wild West" was the deathblow for the big budget western, "The Lone Ranger" is the belated shower of dirt that should finally put the genre to rest.</Review>
            <Review>While there is much good to say about this outrageous reboot of The Lone Ranger, there are also flaws that keep it from being totally successful, starting with a frame story that just doesn't make sense.</Review>

            <Review>Like Max, the movie has to keep moving, and Mr. Blomkamp lets you fill in the gaps yourself as it progresses. Or not.</Review>
            <Review>Though Elysium is a testament to Blomkamp's extraordinary skill as a visual filmmaker, it does not speak nearly so well for his gifts as a writer.</Review>
            <Review>In a summer of antiseptic effects spectacles, Elysium stands out for its grime and intensity, as well as the bluntness of its class allegory.</Review>
            <Review>The action is bludgeoning.</Review>

            <Review>It seems to me that Elysium has its heroes and villains confused.</Review>
            <Review>The big budget sci-fi action spectacle Elysium, written and directed by Neill Blomkamp and starring Matt Damon, serves as a master class in how to make stupid look smart.</Review>
            <Review>You can glide over the Metropolis-like parable and head right into the Mad Max mode. Damon as Max propels the film with muscles and intensity _ that first and the social commentary later is maybe a fair enough deal for our multiplex experience.</Review>

            <Review>A kitsch-fest; a kit-and-caboodle thematic ransacking sellout, geared to drain your kiddie dollars. Like a city dump, you can find anything in there-but would you want to?</Review>
            <Review>It's still a fun adventure for tweens and early teens, but Percy and co are just going through the motions rather than stepping up.</Review>
            <Review>Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters is a good special effects family movie that's every bit as accomplished as The Lightning Thief and possibly better-even if it doesn't follow the Rick Riordan juvenile fantasy novels like a road map.</Review>

            <Review>Ms. Walker doesn't go too deeply into the questions all this raises, but at least she broaches them. Are the sponsors of these athletes promoting recklessness by encouraging stars to push the limits?</Review>

            <Review>Much more than a sports film, Lucy Walker's Oscar-shortlisted The Crash Reel is a thrilling, inspiring, yet cautionary tale about extreme sports that never trades on sentiment.</Review>
            <Review>Walker's most fine-tuned character-driven documentary yet.</Review>
            <Review>The Crash Reel is an affecting reminder of how suddenly circumstances can turn on us. But it's also an inspiring look at how we can deal with even the most hobbling bad luck.</Review>
            <Review>Lucy Walker makes a multi-faceted documentary that deals with the demands on Olympic-level athletes to excel at their chosen sport.</Review>
            <Review>Walker never preaches, she and Kos just lay out an incredible journey with a few supportive side trips to build her case against extreme sports while still celebrating the athletes who participate in them.</Review>

            <Review>A terrible yet lovable take on the haunted-house yarn.</Review>
            <Review>It's not the derivative scares and rudimentary effects that keep this low-budget effort percolating but the improvisational energy of Mr. Santos and Mr. Villarreal, whose ease, chemistry and humor never flag.</Review>
            <Review>The scariest thing about "Ghost Team One" is the horror-comedy's blatant racial minstrelsy.</Review>
            <Review>Destined to be a streaming-video hit with truant frat boys everywhere.</Review>
            <Review>Thanks to the shakiest of shaky-cams, you don't know whether to wince or lose your lunch.</Review>
            <Review>It's spectacularly unoriginal.</Review>
            <Review>Ghost Team One may be the scariest picture this Halloween season, demonstrating that material so blatantly offensive can still be acquired by a major studio, and released mostly without comment.</Review>
            <Review>Really runs out of steam near the end, but there's still a nice batch of raunchy laughs here.</Review>
            <Review>An unyielding exercise in extreme pain.</Review>
            <Review>Kind of a cross between Paranormal Activity and American Pie.</Review>
            <Review>Rather than going straight for the laughs and only the laughs, Ghost Team One delivers two well developed, likable characters that turn the film into an effective narrative capable of sustaining the best and worst of its comedic repertoire.</Review>
            <Review>Ghost Team One is one of the best horror-comedies of 2013. That being said, it suffers from a lot of cheap, frat boy humor.</Review>

            <Review>Sommer is perfect. So is O'Hara. This is the "Before Sunrise" for a very different (and platonic) pair of individuals.</Review>
            <Review>Amid all the looking and dissection, Cohen demonstrates an understanding of the individual need for increasingly elusive privacy that feels urgent, wistful, and quaint.</Review>
            <Review>The quiet time that Johann and Anne spend during museum hours -- and after his shifts on trips around the city -- offer solace in their mutual solitude. Museum Hours is an introverted companion for its viewers.</Review>
            <Review>The two leads contribute fresh, genuine performances, and what might have been a musty academic exercise gains in tension from Cohen's deft juxtaposing of vocal narration, character detail, and majestic artwork.</Review>
            <Review>It's as if Cohen had lived for centuries among these places, and sometimes with art that encapsulates these centuries, and is pleasantly imprisoned within its strength.</Review>
            <Review>It has its tedium, but it's not bad. At times, it's actually quite good.</Review>
            <Review>Emotion is often considered the enemy by experimental filmmakers, but Cohen's films depend on it.</Review>
            <Review>When Cohen's film is over and the lights go out, the world is not the same anymore.</Review>
            <Review>A Chris Marker kind of exceptional experimental film that sets its sights on observing art, the landscape, people, Vienna and our sense of being.</Review>
            <Review>Cohen's simple, masterful film considers how we anoint value.</Review>
            <Review>...encourages you to see the aesthetic potential of everything around you, including each frame that appears on the screen.</Review>
            <Review>This goes on for more than two hours and will bore some viewers to death. Others, though, will find this quiet, complex film a fascinating piece of art in itself.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>This is a deliberately off-kilter, cheerfully violent, hit-and-miss effort with just enough moments of inspiration to warrant a recommendation.</Review>
            <Review>The Family is a pretty uneven film, lurching from comedy to violence to sentiment, but it's best when it sticks in the realm of flat-out farce.</Review>
            <Review>A movie with a PG brain and a NC-17 body count, unsuitable for audiences of any age.</Review>
            <Review>An all-star cast fails to rise above bloody japes and heavy-handed humor in this tale of a renegade Mob family hiding in a small French town.</Review>
            <Review>A black comedy that doesn't begin to jell but has a sweetheart of a cast and the odd diverting moment.</Review>
            <Review>The casting of Robert De Niro as an ex-Mafioso hiding in witness protection is witty in only the silliest, most superficial way. It's a joke with its own tinny, built-in laugh track.</Review>
            <Review>Those excited for the return of Besson to the action-comedy game likely will come away disappointed from this jumbled, visually bland effort.</Review>
            <Review>Full of tone deaf humor and gratuitous violence, The Family marks a miscalculated step for an otherwise fine filmmaker.</Review>
            <Review>As cinema, it's an interesting experiment. As a movie, it's a bloody mess.</Review>
            <Review>For anyone willing to brave some tonal inconsistencies, its rewards are real.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is a curious mess, but the cast is having a grand old time.</Review>
            <Review>De Niro's deadpan humour suits a garden burial perfectly, but we just don't see enough of how we really want him to be.</Review>

            <Review>Jackman is still in his phase of high-masculine misery... The entire performance is an exclamation point, and he swings it like a baseball bat.</Review>
            <Review>Prisoners is weary after ten minutes, and I suppose it has persuaded itself that its length is justified by its solemn gaze into the abyss.</Review>
            <Review>In less talented hands, the story could lapse into the maudlin. But Villeneuve, director of the Oscar-nominated Incendies, seems to know just how far to go; only one moment feels less than authentic, but it would be a spoiler to mention it.</Review>
            <Review>It's got lofty aspirations but it also wants to wallow in the muck - to thrill you and sicken you in equal measure while also being About Something.</Review>
            <Review>Ethical exploration or exploitation? In the end, I come down reservedly on the former side: the work done here by Jackman, Gyllenhaal, and especially Villeneuve is simply too powerful to ignore.</Review>
            <Review>Prisoners is unforgettably relentless in asking moviegoers if Keller has gone too far. And, by extension, asking us how far we would go.</Review>
            <Review>Not for the weak of stomach, Prisoners is a sure signifier that summer is over, more serious fare has arrived in theaters, and the Oscar race has begun.</Review>
            <Review>An increasingly sloppy thriller, filled with obvious clues, laughable red herrings, and halfhearted "shock" reveals, played at a snail's pace that lets far too much air into the narrative.</Review>
            <Review>Face fuzzed with a dark beard more intimidating than Wolverine's, Hugh Jackman is a feral presence, a savage force untamed by his own faith in the all-forgiving divine, in one of the year's most thrilling edge-of-seaters.</Review>
            <Review>It's anything but a breezy journey, but it's a deeply rewarding one for those unafraid of serious, heartbreaking, contemplative, nerve-hitting cinema.</Review>
            <Review>Villeneuve manages to keep us on the edge of our seats without being able to take our eyes off the screen in this fascinating and hypnotic tale that weaves into images the marvelous script written by Aaron Guzikowski. [Full Review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>The last half hour, despite the occasional jolt of excitement, is an embarrassment.</Review>

            <Review>A slow, banjo-string-tight thriller ... Bodies gets under your skin and stays there.</Review>
            <Review>This Sundance-sanctioned, love-on-the-run melodrama is indie filmmaking of a deliberately timeless sort.</Review>
            <Review>A lyrical modern Western that casts a contemporary but un-jaded eye on the romantic mythology of outlaw couples.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director David Lowery strains for poetry at every turn, and only the strain registers.</Review>
            <Review>Lowery has a lyrical style of storytelling that is delicate and subtle yet suffused with emotion and atmosphere. It's gentle and pointed at the same time.</Review>
            <Review>It is not a large film. But Lowery may well be a large talent, and he sure knows how to cast the right actors.</Review>
            <Review>It's one of the best films of the year, and its shrugging Malick comparisons should be taken with a grain of salt - particularly for those of us whose admiration of the man is held with some reservation and qualification.</Review>
            <Review>... the cinematic answer to an outlaw folk song.</Review>
            <Review>There's a good deal to be excited for in Ain't Them Bodies Saints; with another couple films under his belt, hopefully Lowery can develop a more unique voice and make a Badlands of his very own.</Review>
            <Review>Director Lowery, in only his second film, offers us a fine modern-day interpretation of classic Terrence Malick.</Review>
            <Review>Please stop it with the goddammed chicks twirling through fields of sun-dappled what already.</Review>
            <Review>Lowery's beautiful Ain't Them Bodies Saints is about sometimes letting go of who you are for a second chance to be who you to want to be.</Review>

            <Review>If it works at all, fitfully, it's because of the precociously talented and in-control Moretz, who basically carries the entire film on her own small shoulders.</Review>
            <Review>Sequel offers exactly the blend of R-rated nastiness and candy-colored action fans expect.</Review>
            <Review>Even the novelty of a deadly, blasphemous Hit-Girl wears off, and all that's left is over-the-top violence and under-the-belt humor.</Review>
            <Review>What was once shocking now just elicits a shrug.</Review>
            <Review>In trading a modestly subversive critique for a modestly successful romp, Kick-Ass 2 falls short of the expectations set by its predecessor.</Review>
            <Review>Kick-Ass 2 is a giddy kind of ride, offering up well-designed action scenes and a few perfectly aimed visual gags but it never does much with its own satirical stylings.</Review>
            <Review>Chloe Grace Moretz and the character of Hit Girl are so infinitely more entertaining than the film around them, you can't help but wonder why it's not just a movie about her.</Review>
            <Review>A more tonally consistent piece than its predecessor.</Review>
            <Review>The problem with being shocking is that you can only shock once.</Review>
            <Review>Kick-Ass 2 has a twisted energy, and from the first scene, in which a caustic Mindy teaches Dave about the importance of a bulletproof vest, it tries everything it can think of.</Review>

            <Review>With a group so evidently versed in the visuals of rock history, it's a shame that a filmmaker wasn't hired who would pay homage to classic pop films instead of offering a satisfactory paid promotional.</Review>
            <Review>I feel as if I learned very little from One Direction: This is Us, a movie that is more of a consumer product or an event than an actual feature film.</Review>
            <Review>It's hard not to get caught up in the band's infectious enthusiasm for life and drive to make hay while the sun shines.</Review>
            <Review>The boys are very likable, but the film around them is still very repetitive.</Review>
            <Review>About as journalistically useful as a promoted tweet.</Review>
            <Review>Even Niall's schtick of whipping up or quieting down a mass of waiting fans seems the most innocuous metaphor imaginable for the manipulation that, unexamined here, lies at the hollow heart of all this manufactured stardom and its manufactured followers.</Review>
            <Review>What's super-odd about this film is its director, Morgan Spurlock. Best-known as an activist documentarian...it's a bit of a shock to see his controversy-magnet name attached to something so tame, formulaic and corporate.</Review>

        <StoryLine>The music of Frederic Chopin fuels this family-friendly fantasy that fuses live action and 3D animation. Georgie (Heather Graham) is a busy single mother who struggles to balance her career with looking after her daughter Jane (Kizzy Mee) and son Fred (Jamie Munns). Jane has a great interest in music, so Georgie takes her and Fred to a performance by well-known pianist Lang Lang. Rather than simply present a concert, Lang Lang takes Georgie and the kids on a magical journey aboard his piano, a remarkable machine that can fly and travel through space and time. With Lang Lang at the keyboard, they bear witness to the story of Anna, who is sent to live in an unfamiliar town when her father loses his job. Anna and her cousin Chip Chip, however, discover a magic piano of their own and set out to find the family Anna left behind. The Flying Machine features a score drawn from many of Chopin's best known pieces, with the story of Anna and Chip Chip presented in stop-motion animation.</StoryLine>

            <Review>It's a special movie. Odd, disjointed and not entirely coherent, but special.</Review>
            <Review>The movie at last finds its legs in a windup that has great compassion for these sweet, lost souls.</Review>
            <Review>Newlyweeds is a rare movie about stoners that treats pot addiction seriously, carving out a space of its own in a naturalistic middle ground between the familiar standards of surreal comedy and moralistic drama.</Review>

            <Review>Going neither in the direction of Reefer Madness nor a Cheech and Chong movie, it's both funny and serious, and its depictions of pot-smoking could be read as either promotional or cautionary.</Review>

        <Title>The Dyatlov Pass Incident (Devil's Pass)</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>96</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Fact: In February of 1959, nine Russian hikers ventured into a remote area of the Ural Mountains in Russia. Fact: Two weeks later, all nine were found dead. What happened to them is a mystery that has baffled investigators and researchers for decades. It has become known as the Dyatlov Pass Incident. Rumors have attributed their deaths to everything from alien encounters and government conspiracies to supernatural causes. To date, no one has been able to adequately explain what drove nine experienced hikers from their tents so frantically that they ripped through the material from the inside; or how their bodies came to be exposed to such dangerous amounts of radiation that it was still detected weeks later. And no one knows why they were discovered hundreds of yards from their camp, half dressed and with internal injuries including broken ribs and fractured skulls, but with no external wounds at all. The body of one young woman was even missing her tongue. Present Day: Five ambitious American college students are issued a grant to return to the site of the original events in the belief that they can uncover and document the truth of what happened at Dyatlov's Pass. But what they find is more shocking than anything they could have imagined. Their trek through the Ural Mountains, retracing the steps of that ill-fated journey, is plagued by strange and increasingly terrifying phenomena, all of which suggest that in spite of their desolate surroundings, they are not alone. The forces behind the Dyatlov Pass Incident have been waiting for them. The students' recently recovered footage - the only clue to what happened to them - was deemed too disturbing for public eyes. But, like everything else connected to Dyatlov's Pass, the truth has found its way out. (c) IFC Films</StoryLine>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>Made with just enough craft that, were you to stumble upon it late at night during a bout of insomnia, you wouldn't mind watching through to the end.</Review>
            <Review>The film is ridiculous and laugh-out-loud funny, though it's sometimes hard to tell if this is intentional or not. Either way, it remains riveting because of its effective tropes.</Review>
            <Review>Since found-footage movies are purportedly shot by the characters, hiring a muscular action filmmaker like Renny Harlin seems like overkill.</Review>
            <Review>Further evidence that seasoned directors enjoy the found footage gimmick as much as the first-timers seem to.</Review>
            <Review>The decision to assemble it as a found-footage thriller makes it feel like yet another Blair Witch knock-off. And the plot seems to run out of ideas before the end.</Review>
            <Review>Renny Harlin's fun, creepy found-footage horror knows when to be charming and, crucially, when to take its based-on-true-events conspiracy plot to its ridiculously entertaining conclusion.</Review>
            <Review>I'm not suggest Harlin deserves better than the tepid frights of Devil's Pass, but chasing a tired trend with minimal storytelling heft doesn't do him any favors.</Review>
            <Review>Despite drawing influence from a fascinating real-life event, this sloppily directed, largely tension-free found footage film sticks too closely to genre formula.</Review>
            <Review>Its grab at realism makes the artifice highly conspicuous.</Review>
            <Review>This drama unfolds with the uncompromising grasp and precision of real time. We stay with the characters while the camera acts like a visual diary.</Review>
            <Review>Very much like a puzzle that all comes seamlessly together, "Devil's Pass" wallows in formula before veering a sharp, hair-raising left turn just when the film needs it most.</Review>
            <Review>Harlan's film -- written by Vikram Weet -- is a routine low-budget genre picture, with blandly attractive young actors overmatched by the freakiness lurking in the wilderness.</Review>

            <Review>It's an interesting way to tell a story and a devastating journey, particularly since it's based on a real-life incident.</Review>
            <Review>This is a taut psychological study, based on a true story, of the complexities of personal power relationships that begins with the kind of shattering revelation that would be the conclusion of most films.</Review>
            <Review>There is no whodunit here -- the horror is plain in the opening shots -- and the how is presented with great restraint, but the why remains veiled and mysterious long after the film has ended.</Review>
            <Review>Lafosse's of the material has the feel of a psychological crime scene investigation.</Review>
            <Review>Our Children was inspired by a real-life Belgian tragedy, but director Joachim LaFosse has built that news item into his own micro-portrait of coercion dipped in kindness.</Review>
            <Review>At once beautifully realized and brutally uncompromising ...</Review>
            <Review>When the inevitable happens, Lafosse's restraint provokes dread - he's given us a real psychological understanding of the unthinkable.</Review>
            <Review>Challengingly takes the anti-CNN approach to a horrific crime, as upsetting . . . in trying to make the unfathomable credible. . .the film is nuanced and thoughtful.</Review>
            <Review>The audience is held in a vise of claustrophobia, and every room seems full of tiny, screaming children.</Review>
            <Review>The title can refer to the children whose tragic death the film is based on but more subtly on the dependency of Mounir, a North African, on his adoptive father and that of the wife on Mounir.</Review>
            <Review>The film trades in a blank grimness that isn't emotionally involving as much as it is like watching some terrible accident you're helpless to prevent.</Review>
            <Review>Our Children needs more heightened moments; its emphasis on quotidian frustration, while admirable (and probably accurate), just doesn't get across what ultimately made this woman snap.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>76</Duration>
        <StoryLine>A different kind of American independent horror film, the hypnotic Toad Road, presented by Elijah Wood and his SpectreVision production company, unfolds like a hallucinatory cross between the sexual candor of Larry Clark and Harmony Korine, and the backwoods creep-out of The Blair Witch Project. Young James kills time with his small town druggie friends, engaging in excessive chemical intake, until he meets sweet new arrival Sara. But just as James wants to abandon the narcotics life, Sara wants him to take her further into mind-altering experimentation...and she also wants him to introduce her to the sinister local legend of Toad Road, a spot deep in the forest that is apparently home to the Seven Gates of Hell. Writer-director Jason Banker's debut is a unique fusion of documentary-like realism, and otherworldly, haunting rural terror. Unlike any other film you'll see this year, Toad Road is a mesmerizing trip. (c) Artsploitation</StoryLine>

            <Review>Toad Road is sloppy and under-realized, but it should connect with anyone who's ever made terrible choices for no good reason.</Review>
            <Review>An elliptical exploration of the emotional landscape of drug abuse that eschews the tired tropes of Sundance-caliber indies; instead, it's a substances-fueled allegory-qua-mystery.</Review>

            <Review>The candy-colored musical from Taiwanese heartthrob Jay Chou is two-thirds delightful.</Review>
            <Review>"The Rooftop" is frenzied, funny and knowing, drenched in lavish, often surreal, imagery.</Review>
            <Review>"The Rooftop" is a restless boy-fights-for-girl fantasia, too stylistically bulbous a misfire to allow for easy enjoyment as either a demented throwback or a genre hybrid.</Review>
            <Review>Chou, who also wrote and directed, has a good eye for visuals, but when it comes to his screenplay, he could have used a lot more originality.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>With its soap-operatic performances, bonkbuster plotline and sparkling seafront setting, all 'Adore' really lacks is a cameo from Alf Stewart</Review>
            <Review>Would Fontaine have made this film if the mothers looked like and were as old as Barbra Streisand and Kathy Bates and the sons weren't built like surfers? Of course not.</Review>
            <Review>This isn't an Oedipus complex. This is a Preposterous complex.</Review>
            <Review>Cast actresses with the skills that Naomi Watts and Robin Wright bring, give their obliviously icky story some arthouse visual lyricism, and you've got "Adore."</Review>
            <Review>Adore is, as my late mother would say in describing Sidney Sheldon novels, good trash.</Review>
            <Review>An exceedingly silly, sun-baked sex movie, the kind of import that adds just enough brains to its genitals to get into U.S. arthouses. (In the '70s, the mothers would have been played by Laura Antonelli and Sylvia Kristel.)</Review>
            <Review>This film needed serious judgment: someone to rewrite the underwritten draft of the script and to have a firmer opinion on these terribly unappealing characters</Review>
            <Review>There's more depth and feeling to the admittedly provocative premise of this twisted sexual drama than you might expect...It's the excoriating payoff to the story that makes Adoration a cautionary tale with a major sting.</Review>
            <Review>The worst part of Adoration was when I returned to my car and had to pay for my parking, realising that the awfulness of the movie actually took a quantifiable toll on my life: 111 minutes, and $8.50.</Review>
            <Review>Viewed again, far from the madding crowd and general hoo-ha of Sundance, it stands up much better than expected.</Review>
            <Review>Their world seems to hover between their own fantasy and the castrated culture which Fontaine creates. A nothingness envelops them</Review>
            <Review>Melodramatic with a plot more suited to a TV soapie, Christopher Hampton's adaptation of Doris Lessing's 2003 novella The Grandmothers is overblown and totally unbelievable</Review>

Led by Jackie "Miss Funk" Lopez, a single Latina mother, and her partner Leigh "Breeze-Lee" Foaad, they pull together a dance company with young people from the street scene and the yards of Los Angeles' public schools, infusing in them a sense of discipline and commitment. A community develops where people of all races and creeds are able to express themselves, turning their fears and desperation into performance art. More than a dance troupe, Versa-Style becomes a family and serves to upend prejudice about the hip hop lifestyle.</StoryLine>

            <Review>its dramatization of a U.S. dream team's journey to the international showcase is leaden with predictable character types and storytelling clichés, neither of which its well-executed but oddly infrequent dance sequences are able to overcome.</Review>
            <Review>The actual dancing scenes are occasionally electrifying, if far too sparse, but other than that and the welcome sight of co-star Chris Brown getting clocked in the face, the film barely gets off the ground, much less sticks the landing.</Review>
            <Review>A dead-in-the-soul cash grab of a movie set in the competitive world of B-boy dancing that thinks clichés, phony melodrama and product placement can substitute for real storytelling and actual characters.</Review>
            <Review>Battle of the Year clearly features lots of brilliant dancers, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy watching them move. But you wish there were more dancing here.</Review>
            <Review>Should satisfy the planet of b-boys and girls to whom it thoroughly preaches, while amusing anyone else who simply can't ignore the promise of an all-corn buffet.</Review>
            <Review>The movie's inability to showcase its greatest asset, the grace and control of its dancers, is its most conspicuous failing.</Review>
            <Review>Not only does it fail to use 3D, with its rapid edits, but the dramatic stuff is poorly edited and sound mixed as well.</Review>
            <Review>Despite the reasonable dancing scenes and passable acting by singer Chris Brown, Battle Of The Year is a string of clichés, stock characters and unbearable melodrama.</Review>
            <Review>Even when a dance movie is following the formula as closely as Battle of the Year does, occasionally something you won't get to see anywhere else slips through.</Review>

            <Review>This is one of those rarities, an animated sequel that improves on the original.</Review>
            <Review>Co-directors Chris Renaud and Pierre Coffin, who do Minion voices expertly, never let up on the laughs. A fart joke in 3-D may not be three times as wacky, but the high spirits of Despicable Me 2 are irresistible fun.</Review>
            <Review>How do you tell a story about a bad guy who is no longer a bad guy? Despicable Me 2 embraces the dilemma and adds new ones.</Review>
            <Review>As a sequel [it] stands level with the first film (also directed by Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud), and may have the edge on it.</Review>
            <Review>"Despicable Me 2" lags on occasion, but every time I found my attention waning, the filmmakers did something wicked to goose me.</Review>
            <Review>[A] remarkably tepid sequel to the surprise 2010 hit ...</Review>
            <Review>Despicable Me 2 earns the right to be slight and nutty because it cultivated those feelings in its predecessor.</Review>
            <Review>It's hard to tell if directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud faced interference on the part of the studio, but the film lacks any discernible spark beyond frenzied goofiness.</Review>
            <Review>The first act of Despicable Me 2 is so winning and engaging that it's almost a tragedy how the rest of the film falls into bargain basement formula.</Review>
            <Review>...a passable followup that's sure to amuse and entertain fans of the original.</Review>
            <Review>Carrell's almost better this way, with his mugging fully abstracted by animation, whereas we start to miss Wiig's actual face.</Review>
            <Review>Franchises are born more from box-office success than creative necessity, and this sequel has only a fraction of the originality demonstrated by its predecessor.</Review>

            <Review>Exists purely to showcase how idiotically over-the-top action sequences can become when annoyances like gravity are tossed to the side.</Review>
            <Review>Some of the action sequences are insane. No, really. Absurd, impossible, physics defying, triage-required stuff. No matter. That's the foolish rush of a franchise that must go faster and faster and furiouser and furiouser.</Review>

            <Review>Furious Six continues on in the same vein as its predecessor, and may just be my favorite of the lot.</Review>
            <Review>As long as 'let it go, bro' is your mantra, you'll have a fine time at Fast and Furious 6.</Review>
            <Review>There's still some gas left in the tank here.</Review>
            <Review>Nobody goes to these movies for dialogue. And maybe that's true - but that doesn't mean they have to be written like a bunch of third graders playing "movie" in the school yard.</Review>
            <Review>Diesel's mega-bass voice and the slo-mo charisma with which he delivers those bass lines have resulted in a series that got more popular in its fifth and sixth installments.</Review>
            <Review>Unfortunately, in between bouts of high-speed action there's a dud story about nasty mercenaries driving around Europe stealing military equipment.</Review>
            <Review>If action is your cinematic elixir of choice, "Fast &amp; Furious 6" won't just sate your thirst - you'll be blackout drunk by the end credits.</Review>

            <Review>Reeves has clearly seen many Hong Kong films, and with the help of two veterans, Hollywood cinematographer Elliot Davis and HK editor Derek Hui, he's replicated one.</Review>
            <Review>Keanu Reeves makes his directorial debut in a cartoonish kung fu movie with splashy fight scenes and an underdeveloped wit.</Review>
            <Review>Don't get too hopeful for greatness, but the damned thing works.</Review>
            <Review>[An] ambitious but generic martial-arts movie.</Review>
            <Review>Cinematographer Elliot Davis films the fight scenes with thrilling immediacy: lots of long takes, so you realize you are actually seeing these guys actually do this, as opposed to watching something pieced together later in the editing room.</Review>
            <Review>Yes, it's irreverent at times, but Man Of Tai Chi exudes confidence in its silliness, too, never actually treating the subject of martial arts as light or inconsequential.</Review>
            <Review>Man of Tai Chi is probably one of the best martial arts films this side of The Raid.</Review>
            <Review>Pro forma, sure, but briskly paced. For the most part, the fight scenes are grounded in physical potential, but there are shots and edits that have simple physical magic to them.</Review>
            <Review>While Reeves exhibits natural talent behind the camera, his debut carries an austere coldness that shuts out any semblance of diverting pleasure.</Review>
            <Review>[Director Keanu Reeves] cuts too much, but he respects the fighters' abilities - and the viewers' desire to see them.</Review>
            <Review>The big revelation of the protagonist feels rushed, but Man of Tai Chi mixes this perfect concoction of outlandish and awesome and is extremely entertaining if you can just enjoy it as a simple martial arts film.</Review>

            <Review>The kind of film that makes you wish they had perfected choose-your-own-adventure technology for movies, one that would allow you to ditch the central character and follow any number of the story's more interesting second bananas.</Review>
            <Review>I wanted to like this movie more than I did.</Review>
            <Review>There is strong character work in here, one or two genuinely touching moments, and some good laughs too.</Review>
            <Review>Innocuous then, but sadly lacking the wit and insight of Shelton's far superior Your Sister's Sister.</Review>
            <Review>After a couple of gimmicky transgressive comedies (Humpday and Your Sister's Sister), writer-director Lynn Shelton takes a more observant approach this time.</Review>
            <Review>Everything feels sketchy and unformed in a film with promising elements that fail to gel.</Review>
            <Review>Decent performances, but the film as a whole is a dramatic and thematic mess.</Review>
            <Review>The semi-improvised dialogue has the juicy tang of authenticity in the hands of this highly competent cast, and the players and Shelton never sneer at the characters' new-agey beliefs.</Review>

            <Review>While it's a loving homage to movies like Dario Argento's Suspiria and is crafted with tons of style, it leaves out one key ingredient: being even remotely scary.</Review>
            <Review>Radishes, cabbages and melons meet horrific ends in Berberian Sound Studio, a down-the-earhole psychodrama where what you hear is more terrifying than what you see.</Review>
            <Review>Writer/director Peter Strickland intriguingly weaves into the story a movie-within-a-movie that we barely see, but we hear.</Review>
            <Review>A sometimes interesting, sometimes head-scratching movie that pays homage to the old ways of the sound mixing world and to the "giallo" genre of horror that was prominent in Italy during the 1970s.</Review>
            <Review>[It] not only exploits one of cinema's most important modes, it also attempts something more difficult: turning a genre movie into a work of art.</Review>
            <Review>A one-trick pony, but it's a reasonably cool trick.</Review>
            <Review>An intriguing and clever-sounding idea that unfortunately loses its way in the translation from script to screen.</Review>
            <Review>Poses some compelling questions about the emotional and mental impact of making dark, violent, disturbing films.</Review>
            <Review>Berberian Sound Studio follows Hitchcock's doctrine fully: what information audiences fill in with their imagination is always more horrifying than anything that can be filmed</Review>
            <Review>If you're open to films that fearlessly twist the conventions, and that mine the language of sound and image for their own strange potential, you'll get a kick from this rivetingly inventive, abrasively un-British piece of nightmare cinema.</Review>
            <Review>Berberian Sound Studio refuses such a climax: it at once celebrates giallo and takes it apart, disassembling it like Derren Brown explaining an illusion.</Review>
            <Review>This twisty psychological horror yarn from writer/director Peter Strickland is the best kind, one that is open to many interpretations but can be enjoyed on its own creepy and insinuating surface.</Review>

            <Review>It's atmospheric and a tense journey, arguably not unlike Gravity if you were to replace the vacuum of space with a bunch of angry, accented dudes</Review>
            <Review>The whole thing is laugh-out-loud dumb.</Review>
            <Review>Hyett earned his reputation as a prosthetics wiz on films like The Descent and The Woman in Black; the human monsters he gives us here might as well be made out of cardboard.</Review>
            <Review>It's cleverly made on a small budget, but is so over-designed and carefully structured that we never believe it.</Review>
            <Review>If only the dialogue and camera work were as good as the make-up effects.</Review>
            <Review>A soulless horror thriller that fails to captivate thanks to a poor script and some terribly unconvincing performances from certain cast members.</Review>
            <Review>This is a deeply unpleasant subject matter and Hyett's handling of it leaves a nasty taste in the mouth.</Review>
            <Review>A horror film of two halves: the first squalid and hard to stomach, the second surreal and hard to take seriously.</Review>

            <Review>The Hunt's inexorability feels derived more from thematic or ideological concerns than any organic necessity.</Review>
            <Review>Thomas Vinterberg's The Hunt conveys the sinister swirl of persecution more vividly than any film I can remember.</Review>
            <Review>Through it all, we see an idyllic-looking community, where glorious fall colors fade into twinkling December snow - a pretty frame for a terrifying story of a modern-day witch hunt.</Review>

            <Review>What makes The Hunt so affecting is the way [Thomas] Vinterberg jangles the nerves of what first appears to be a strong community of caring neighbors and peels back the cover of civilized behavior to find tribal instincts kicking in.</Review>

            <Review>It's just not quite funny enough.</Review>
            <Review>With a wink and a shrug, Sightseers shows us evil in all its banality.</Review>
            <Review>A brilliant, deliciously wicked, and thoroughly enjoyable road film ...</Review>
            <Review>Darkly funny as it is, the movie has undercurrents of genuine and very British weirdness.</Review>
            <Review>Sightseers is everything you could want from a dark comedy infused with horror and is by far Wheatley's most assured work to date.</Review>
            <Review>It has a levity and self-aware absurdity that makes it not only a different kind of beast, but also another film that marks Ben Wheatley as a young director to keep an eye on.</Review>
            <Review>The film is certainly funny, but the laughs aren't as constant as you'd hope from a film like this.</Review>
            <Review>Uncomfortably lurching from broad slapstick to dark and sharp gore - often in the space of a single scene - Sightseers adds up to a rather jumbled whole, despite the punchlines hitting as often as they miss.</Review>
            <Review>Devised by acting-writing comedy team Lowe and Oram and co-scripted by Amy Jump, director Ben Wheatley's professional and personal partner, the movie pokes fun at the social limitations of these lumpen Midlanders without sneering at or patronizing them.</Review>

            <Review>With its sprawling array of characters and anecdotal, ramshackle structure, [the film] feels more like a collection of interrelated short stories cobbled into an flavorful but ultimately unwieldy narrative.</Review>
            <Review>It's one thing to explore the messiness of familial relationships and regret against the backdrop of the Vietnam War, and something else entirely to try and shove every jot and tiddle in place before the closing credits roll.</Review>
            <Review>Jayne Mansfield's Car isn't likely to set America's theaters on fire, but it's a powerful whisper of a film.</Review>
            <Review>Overall, the rambling "Jayne Mansfield's Car" is almost as big a wreck as its namesake.</Review>
            <Review>In its best moments, you can see what the film might have been with half a dozen fewer characters.</Review>
            <Review>Zany but strained period piece dramedy.</Review>
            <Review>Jayne Mansfield's Car is dramatic and funny and entertaining in many parts, but the jigsaw puzzle doesn't always flow from piece to piece. For all of Thornton's directing skill, the overall film can be episodic and loses focus repeatedly.</Review>
            <Review>The truly superb cast of Jayne Mansfield's Car sputters in this confused melodrama that is more pre-occupied with explicitly saying everything rather than genuinely saying something.</Review>
            <Review>It's obvious that Billy Bob Thornton is attempting something meaningful with Jayne Mansfield's Car. It's just tough to figure out what it is.</Review>
            <Review>The inconsistent tone and melodramatic tendencies unfortunately cancel out strong portrayals.</Review>

            <Review>Modest in scale, expansive in emotions, this movie is a rarity: a contemporary tragicomedy.</Review>
            <Review>Despite its ultimate sense of optimism, the Glasgow-set dramedy nevertheless carries a sense of foreboding. And yet, that might not have been the intention.</Review>
            <Review>The result is a sometimes gritty, occasionally charming Highland hybrid, but the final balance feels slightly off-kilter.</Review>
            <Review>Loach takes us through the mysteries of whisky making, exploring the subtle tastes and scents in ways that will have audiences wishing they had a dram at hand. But a glass also serves more symbolic purposes ...</Review>
            <Review>If you want to look for it, you'll find a layer of metaphor (the distilling process as a symbol of the characters' evolution) and social-realist commentary amid the gentle, life-affirming laughs.</Review>
            <Review>[Ken Loach] and his longtime screenwriter, Paul Laverty, find a good balance between drama and wacky character moments.</Review>
            <Review>Probably the first Ken Loach film you could call 'jaunty.'</Review>
            <Review>The film is cocktail of comedy and heist with a large shot of social realism.</Review>
            <Review>Slipping back and forth between drama and comedy, The Angels' Share initially seems shaggy and unstructured, but that's part of its appeal.</Review>
            <Review>Mingling the peaty scent of Scottish street life with a distilled take on unemployed, at-risk youth, director Ken Loach serves up a surprisingly upbeat cocktail thanks to a subplot involving rare whisky.</Review>
            <Review>With this shaggy-dog tale of four petty Glaswegian criminals and their improbably successful scheme to steal the world's most valuable whiskey, Loach turns naïveté into a sort of moral philosophy.</Review>
            <Review>...a low key and rather marvelous, sweet-natured heist movie</Review>

        <StoryLine>A Paris-based fashion-maven returns to the UK to defend her younger brother against a trumped-up murder charge, and begins to unravel a major conspiracy that spells danger for them both in this urgent thriller from BAFTA-winning writer Paul Abbot (Shameless, State of Play). Deeva Jani (Parminder Nagra) is working in the upper echelons of the fashion industry when she receives some shocking news: Her teenage brother Vipon (Sebastian Nanena) has been arrested as the prime suspect in a gang-related, East London shooting. The victim has died, and the community is up in arms as Vipon faces trial. Knowing that he won't be safe behind bars, Deeva races to East Londin in search of answers, enlisting the aid of gangster-turned-youth counselor Clint (Jonas Armstrong) to clear her brother's name, and save his life. Meanwhile, catching wind of Deeva's investigation, the corrupt DCI Stone (Stephen Dillane) does everything in his power to prevent her from unraveling a labyrinthine plot that could implicate some of the most powerful figures in British government. Michael Socha and Nichola Burley co-star.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Badly let down by some silly plotting that negates the film's ability to be taken seriously and a screenplay that all too often reduces a lot of the characters to stereotype.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Based on his play by the same name, Neil LaBute's script follows a successful writer (Adam Brody) who, on the eve of his wedding, travels across the country to meet up with ex-lovers in an attempt to make amends for past relationship transgressions. Crisscrossing from Seattle to Boston, he reunites with high school sweetheart SAM (Jennifer Morrison), sexually free-spirited TYLER (Mia Maestro), married college professor LINDSAY (Emily Watson), his best friend's little sister REGGIE (Zoe Kazan), and "the one that got away" BOBBI (Kristen Bell). Daisy von Scherler Mayer (PARTY GIRL) directs this journey of a modern-day Candide stumbling through a landscape familiar to most men-messy breakups. (c) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>Attains the occasional moment of clarity, but ultimately has neither the dramatic heft nor the anchoring talent to justify an hour and a half in the company of a boring sociopath.</Review>
            <Review>There are a lot of truthful notes in "Some Girl(s)," but there are also false ones that let you know that you are being played with. You'd best beware.</Review>
            <Review>Mayer does little to open up LaBute's original play, and the staginess often feels oppressive. The performances are mixed, too.</Review>
            <Review>The deft and merciless director sides with the girls, and to stack the deck she's hired five tremendous actresses who thrill to tear poor Brody apart</Review>
            <Review>The title's parenthetical plural sums up the problem with Some Girl(s): Five slow-cook dialogues that reveal the nice-guy protagonist as a super-tool is four too many.</Review>
            <Review>The things that once made Neil LaBute's movies seem like tossed grenades - the loutish protagonists, the sadism toward women - now come off as more dated than scandalous.</Review>
            <Review>This acerbic wit and fearless desire to distort our worst features into our most prevalent ones are why Neil LaBute is an auteur of note.</Review>
            <Review>More canned misanthropy from Neil LaBute. Cut-rate Carnal Knowledge.</Review>
            <Review>LaBute's writing is quick and sharp, as usual.</Review>
            <Review>Penned by the incomparable Neil LaBute, Some Girl(s) is theatrical and contrived; to some, it might achieve some rather off-putting extremes of hyper-reality.</Review>
            <Review>The weight of dull clichés only makes the stilted dialogue harder to stomach.</Review>
            <Review>Adam Brody keeps the unnamed protagonist distant, strangely blank, as if part of his problem is his lack of any real personality of his own, prompting him to parasitise the charismatic women he meets and try to substitute scandalous behaviour for depth.</Review>

            <Review>This biopic is part hagiography, part expose, and gravely incoherent.</Review>
            <Review>In the end, hers is a journey as complicated and fascinating as that of South Africa itself.</Review>
            <Review>It would have benefited the film if Roodt had been as bold with the mechanics of his storytelling as he is with his inclusion of the title character's less savory moments. But its strengths, particularly the two lead performances, far outweigh its flaws.</Review>
            <Review>"Winnie Mandela'' really stumbles when it comes to depicting the couple's painful separation, which the film suggests resulted more from politics than Winnie's infidelity.</Review>
            <Review>Despite the marquee names and their obvious talent, the film feels like a made-for-TV movie.</Review>
            <Review>Distant and obvious, it takes a story with many angles and reduces its edges, becoming a glorified TV movie.</Review>
            <Review>This saccharine hagiography desires to establish Nelson Mandela's controversial ex-wife as great. It succeeds, somewhat, but boringly, which leaves the truth not served well.</Review>
            <Review>The end credits song's beautifully delivered, full-throttle emotional bombast only serves as a dismaying reminder of how much the film otherwise lacks any similar passion and soul.</Review>
            <Review>The audacity and determination of its subject doesn't find its way into this shallow and superficial biopic.</Review>
            <Review>Though Winnie Mandela is a more-than-serviceable classroom recounting of events, it fails to reach much higher than that, and deals with identity issues when deciding whether to challenge your views or simply glorify real-life events.</Review>
            <Review>Sometimes it can be strangely said that it's a miracle when a certain film even exists, warts and all. So let's cut to the chase, and what really matters in this immensely important movie. Not the least which is, 'Strike a woman, and you strike a rock.'</Review>
            <Review>A warts-and-all biopic which focuses on its subject's childhood, college days and marriage while making short shrift of her transition into a war criminal.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate/>
        <Duration>73</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Featuring the viral humor of its creators Ed Skudder and Zack Keller, Dick Figures the Movie is a classic story of friendship, love and betrayal. Its heroes Red and Blue (on the solemn advice of a Japanese raccoon) embark on an epic quest to discover The Great Sword of Destiny - and hopefully unlock the secret to the most-awesomest gift of all time for Blue's super hot girlfriend, Pink. And like the series, the 73-minute movie is set to an all original thumping electronic dance score from Composer Nick Keller. (C) Media Grind</StoryLine>

            <Review>Yes, this is the point in the summer when I outsource my critical judgment to my kids.</Review>
            <Review>"The Smurfs 2" probably isn't any worse than you might expect. On the other hand, it's almost certainly not any better.</Review>
            <Review>Reluctant parents: you don't need to tell your kids that you won't love them if they like "The Smurfs 2." Instead, you can silently judge them until either you and/or they simply can't bear the thought of talking to each other.</Review>
            <Review>Not so much of a film as it is a collection of images and sounds that bludgeon you.</Review>
            <Review>It would be too much to say that there's a good movie somewhere inside Smurfs 2 looking to get out. But it wouldn't be too much to say that sometimes, the movie we do have tries harder than we might expect.</Review>
            <Review>The trouble with this stunted sequel is that the doughy, blobby-hatted Smurfs are mostly window dressing for an abrasive slapstick bash built around a tiresome kidnap plot ...</Review>
            <Review>Smurfs 2 just isn't an enjoyable time.</Review>
            <Review>Smurfs 2 isn't quite so good at appealing to adults, but it's harmless fun for the littlies.</Review>
            <Review>The pacing is fine but the dialogue is trite. Older children and adults will also find the main plot and Smurf gibberish tedious, redeemed only by Azaria's performance and a sideplot involving Gargamel.</Review>
            <Review>The Smurfs 2 panders to children, offering nothing more than a series of fart jokes and pratfalls, for the obvious purpose of cashing in on an already established fan base.</Review>
            <Review>Yay! The Smurfs are back - bigger, bolder and bluer than ever. It's fun fun fun, a more-than-worthy, hyper-energetic sequel to the fabulous first film...It's all wonderful fantasy nonsense, delivered fast and with plenty of self-consciously cheap laughs.</Review>
            <Review>IT'S a rarity, but it's nice when a sequel learns from the mistakes of its predecessor.</Review>

            <Review>The result may not be a big movie, but Things Never Said makes a big emotional impact.</Review>
            <Review>When it comes to writing the poetry that Kalindra recites, Murray knows how to do more with less; he needs to apply that lesson to his filmmaking, too.</Review>
            <Review>A powerful statement about the plight of women held back by sexist tyranny.</Review>
            <Review>The film's stars ... are hugely charismatic individually and have chemistry with each other. But the soapy melodrama and ferocious, on-the-nose poems threaten to overpower their budding romance.</Review>
            <Review>The movie's poems are unambiguous rants, delivered with theatrical ferocity. On-the-nose dialogue propels its lessons in self-respect.</Review>
            <Review>Veteran TV writer Charles Murray (Third Watch) shows his small-screen roots by overrelying on tense, weighty exchanges to advance the narrative, but Hampton's steely performance makes them pay off, as the poet learns to wrest truth from pain.</Review>
            <Review>The familiar themes of escaping abuse and self-actualization/redemption/salvation through art become, in Murray and his cast's hands, something uniquely and memorably moving and exhilarating.</Review>
            <Review>The kind of film that Hollywood rarely makes anymore: smart, deep, honest, genuinely poignant and complex. It will nourish your heart, mind and soul. Shanola Hampton delivers a bravura, star-making performance.</Review>
            <Review>An uplifting tale of female empowerment tarnished by its crude method of delivering a positive message.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Chloe (Evelyne Brochu) is a young Canadian obstetrician working in a makeshift clinic in a Palestinian refugee camp in the West Bank, where she treats pregnant women under the supervision of Michael (Carlo Brandt), a French doctor. Facing daily checkpoints and the separation barrier, Chloe is confronted with the conflict and the people it affects: Rand (Sabrina Ouazani), a patient for whom Chloe develops a deep affection; Faysal (Yousef Sweid), Rand's older brother, a fervent resister; Safi (Hammoudeh Alkarmi), their younger brother, a child shattered by war who dreams of flying across borders; and Ava (Sivan Levy), a young soldier who lives next door to Chloe in her apartment in Israel. Her encounter with the war draws Chloe into an adventure that's both deeply personal and as large as the land. She loses her bearings, is uprooted, and goes into freefall. There are trips that shake us and transform us. There are trips that shatter all of our certainties. For Chloe, INCH'ALLAH is such a trip.(c) eOne</StoryLine>

            <Review>I certainly do not move that the film should be suppressed, only that one should know what it is. It is a bath in a smiling madness.</Review>
            <Review>This stunning "documentary of the imagination" shows Anwar and other thugs staging scenes of torture and murder for the camera.</Review>

            <Review>The film's quartet of post-slackers are captured as they feel their way around the edges of what they want (and are afraid to ask for) with painful accuracy.</Review>
            <Review>Here's a toast to the cast and crew: "Drinking Buddies" is a three-dimensional movie that doesn't require beer goggles.</Review>
            <Review>[Swanberg] points the movie in directions that defy our expectations, exploring the characters' immaturity and the entropy of human interaction.</Review>
            <Review>Not much happens in Drinking Buddies, which, frankly, is refreshing.</Review>
            <Review>"Drinking Buddies" sneaks up on you; you think it's going in one direction, and suddenly it goes somewhere much more interesting.</Review>
            <Review>Swanberg doesn't exactly reinvent the romantic-comedy formula, but he explores it in unexpected ways, with a terrific cast making the relationships all the more genuine and enjoyable.</Review>
            <Review>Every aspect of this film fits together nicely, even when the drama going on in the film is a little messy.</Review>
            <Review>This is a giant nothing. I can't think of a recent picture where I've seen less effort to enlighten or entertain.</Review>
            <Review>I was a bit skeptical when I first learned about Drinking Buddies, because I did not expect Wilde and her cohorts to be up for the task; thankfully, I was proven wrong, and the actors go places that I would never expect studio-seasoned actors to go.</Review>
            <Review>A beautifully observed dramedy about modern friendship and romance; funny, poignant, unforgettable.</Review>
            <Review>It finds its groove with sincere, nuanced performances and a realistic attitude to romance as refreshing as a fistful of Citra hops.</Review>
            <Review>For a film all about the betrayal of those we love the most, Drinking Buddies is a supremely optimistic, warm-hearted picture, with fine, freeing performances from its entire (albeit very small) cast.</Review>

            <Review>True fans will find their gold dust woman as the doc unspools, witnessing the creative machinery behind her songwriting process, as Nicks makes the 2011 album of the same name in her California home studio.</Review>
            <Review>There is probably much more and much less to the life and times of Stevie Nicks than what is presented in this picture. But it will take someone else to bring that story to the screen.</Review>
            <Review>[A] vanity project.</Review>
            <Review>For all the generic filmmaking device, In Your Dreams is not a generic experience because Stevie Nicks is not your average pop star.</Review>
            <Review>While watching people write is rarely effective cinema, the only thing less gripping is watching people track boring albums, which Nicks and her band do throughout In Your Dreams.</Review>

            <Review>How refreshing to have a transgender biopic that is so full of hope, honesty and humour.</Review>
            <Review>A movie about a man with a vagina that kicked me right in the emotional nutsack.</Review>
            <Review>Mr. Angel is definitely X-rated in terms of the body parts on display, but it's so wholesome that it's impossible to be offended. After all, aren't children's movies always telling us to be who we are?</Review>
