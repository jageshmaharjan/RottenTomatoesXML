            <Review>Despite Katharine Isabelle's best efforts, Torment becomes a tiresome genre affair that never hides its obvious influences.</Review>
            <Review>It is all very derivative - but masked children will always have a creepy uncanniness which Baker certainly know how to exploit.</Review>

            <Review>It's hard not to wonder if Duvall got passed over for a role in Last Vegas and, not to be outdone by that snake Kevin Kline, decided to make the Western version instead.</Review>
            <Review>Duvall can justify it all, he's just that kind of actor, but "A Night in Old Mexico" hasn't worked hard enough to give him a story worthy of his talents. In many cases, he is acting all alone up there.</Review>
            <Review>The director Emilio Aragón wisely trains the camera on Mr. Duvall. "A Night in Old Mexico" is his baby, and he rocks it.</Review>
            <Review>The movie doesn't have the same kind of emotional depth that Duvall and Wittliff managed to pull off decades ago. Worse, the dialogue often sounds stilted.</Review>
            <Review>This poky, clichéd, slackly told picture, directed by Emilio Aragón, would've felt dated a few decades ago; now it feels like a downright relic.</Review>
            <Review>Not a second of this feels real, but at least we see Duvall croon "Mexicali Rose."</Review>
            <Review>... has some effective comedic moments, yet is less compelling as an examination of aging or fractured family dynamics.</Review>
            <Review>It's fairly plain that "A Night in Old Mexico" is a vehicle for Duvall, and as such it's thoroughly enjoyable; watching him is a genuine treat.</Review>
            <Review>The well-nuanced performance of Robert Duvall, among the greatest actors of our time, compensates for the contrived and oversimplified screenplay.</Review>
            <Review>A Night In Old Mexico would be stronger if it acknowledged a bit more how tall a tale it's telling. But it's good to see Duvall demonstrate so forcibly that he has no intention of going gently into that good night.</Review>
            <Review>A scruffy tale built around a hilariously, quotably gruf performance by the great Robert Duvall.</Review>
            <Review>Red is the kind of lazily written, thankless curmudgeon role that uses the trials of advanced age for cheap laughs rather than harnessing a veteran actor's talent to engage our empathy.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>It's a bad movie, the kind that presents itself with countless opportunities to create suspense or dread and wastes them.</Review>
            <Review>It is difficult to become fully absorbed in goings-on when the characters keep having to deal with plummeting IQs.</Review>
            <Review>Do you like your horrid "found footage" ripoffs riddled with amateur pornography? If so, SX_Tape is just the movie you've been looking for!</Review>
            <Review>Its creepy setting, lighting and sound designs deliver some scares, but there's not enough in terms of surprises or cleverness.</Review>
            <Review>There's no reason or logic in this found-footage yawner, and nothing rises to the level of even adolescent notions of sexy-scary.</Review>
            <Review>Steeped in the gritty, grimy minutiae of urban decay and chillingly well-defined supernatural components that made [Rose's] breakout hit Candyman an enduring cult favourite.</Review>
            <Review>Even though the film ultimately gives viewers two different stories merged into one (not unlike the inchoate forms in Jill's paintings), it still somehow just feels repetitive and uneconomic.</Review>

            <Review>A high-profile Spanish project that's uneven on every level except technique, the watchable but forgettable "The Last Days" finds helmers Alex and David Pastor failing to deliver on the promise of their 2009 English-language debut, "Carriers."</Review>
            <Review>Overall, fantastic film.</Review>
            <Review>although it's about ten minutes too long, The Last Days is a moving, often thrilling piece of end of the world cinema that has a little too much treacle.</Review>
            <Review>This Spanish production tackles a familiar subject -- the post apocalyptic world -- and imbues it not only with a fresh premise but also with real heart and character.</Review>
            <Review>This is the final message the film leaves us with, that even when living a perpetual nightmare trapped in a crumbling city of a decaying world, there is always still hope.</Review>
            <Review>The Last Days may not represent the flashiest apocalypse story you'll ever see, but there's always something to be said for clever storytelling, good acting, and novel apocalypse tales.</Review>
            <Review>No doubt Spain. can do with the optimistic message that the next generation will inherit a better world - but it makes for an unsatisfyingly pat &amp; oversentimental conclusion to a film that began so promisingly in all its drably satirical bleakness.</Review>

            <Review>The Face of Love's story runs and blotches like cheap mascara.</Review>
            <Review>Many are going to find the plot questionable and the protagonist's actions deplorable. But for those who've experienced loss and grief that seems irreparable, it is a film that will strike a deep and melancholy chord.</Review>
            <Review>Old age, romance, grief, delusion and desperation all intersect in "The Face of Love," a far-fetched tale that nevertheless manages to be affecting.</Review>
            <Review>What's mesmerizing here is what happens in Bening's eyes, in her complicated smiles, in her eloquent quiet.</Review>
            <Review>Bening and Harris are great actors, and they fill their roles as completely as they can, given the limitations of the soggy and implausible script by Matthew McDuffie and director Arie Posin.</Review>
            <Review>Like so much about this film, the finale hints at Hitchcock but settles for soap opera.</Review>
            <Review>The Face of Love quickly accumulates emotional subplots that distract from this central idea.</Review>
            <Review>Bening and Harris pour so much genuine emotion into their roles in this Vertigo-like romantic melodrama that they just about carry the film's fanciful premise.</Review>
            <Review>Both leads take on the task of the dysfunctional couple admirably, but their efforts crash against a stubbornly creaky script.</Review>
            <Review>Sadly, this all feels like a wasted effort.</Review>
            <Review>The actors, though, lift the material. The most poignant performance comes from the late Robin Williams in a cameo as Nikki's neighbour and friend.</Review>
            <Review>Middle-aged romances are rare on the big screen, so it's frustrating that this one is so badly compromised by a series of contrived plot points.</Review>

        <Title>Lost Moment</Title>
        <ReleaseDate/>
        <Duration>89</Duration>
        <StoryLine>It is said that Henry James' The Aspern Papers were inspired by the romance between Lord Byron and his mistress Claire Claremont, who in her dotage jealously guarded the poems written by Byron in her honor. In the film version of James' novel, The Lost Moment, the Clairemont character, renamed Juliana, is a blind, 105-year-old recluse, played with an abundance of age makeup by Agnes Moorehead (whose amazing cosmetic makeover was the subject of several magazine articles back in 1947). The plot of the film concentrates on the efforts by a publisher named Lewis (Robert Cummings) to obtain the "lost" poems written by a legendary literary figure to the centenarian Juliana. The old lady is fiercely protected by her near-psychotic niece Tina (Susan Hayward), who nonetheless agrees to help Lewis get his hands on the precious documents. As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that the Venetian mansion where Juliana resides harbors a horrible secret, one that bodes ill for the troubled Tina and everyone with whom she comes in contact. Watching in bewildered silence is Father Rinaldo (Eduardo Cianelli), the film's "voice of conscience". Together with The Heiress, The Lost Moment is one of the few successful attempts to transfer the elusive prose of Henry James to the screen. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>The laughs in this film are all mean-spirited or just frat-boy gross.</Review>
            <Review>Almost unrelenting in its takedown both of an American institution and the country's obsession with victories big and small, Bad Words is more misanthropic fantasy than satiric fiction.</Review>
            <Review>Trashy, ribald laughs in the Bad Santa vein, this marks Bateman's directorial debut; it's not much to look at, but at least he has the nerve to push the insolence, profanity, and brutal insult humor to its absolute limits.</Review>
            <Review>In his directorial debut, Bateman casts himself as a foul-mouthed, racist jerk. It's a stretch for the nice-guy actor, but the role doesn't suit him.</Review>
            <Review>While Bad Words is only sporadically funny, Bateman throws himself into the role without shame or ego. The film is also his directing debut, and a very capable one.</Review>
            <Review>Bateman has cornered the market on ornery average dudes with rapier wits.</Review>
            <Review>Chand holds his own opposite Bateman and steals much of the film with a deceptively ruthless cunning, hidden beneath the cutest, most innocent smile in the world.</Review>
            <Review>Bateman handles the edgy material with confidence and gets excellent performances from co-stars Kathryn Hahn, Allison Janney and Philip Baker Hall, and particularly from Rohan Chand.</Review>
            <Review>The film's dialogue is so crude, its star so inherently - and paradoxically - likable, and its plot so lightweight that it essentially cancels itself out.</Review>
            <Review>...a withering send-up of our kid-obsessed culture, in which childhood has been reimagined as a procession of parent-directed accomplishments.</Review>
            <Review>[Allison Janney's] presence on any show or movie ultimately has a kind of 'Poochie' effect: whenever she's not on screen you just expect everyone else to be wondering, "Where's Janney?", hoping that somehow spirits her back.</Review>

            <Review>They've found a way of serving up these images without seeming callous or exploitative or preachy.</Review>
            <Review>Although the visuals are spectacular - a barren Colorado River looks like a landscape from a science-fiction epic - there's not much else here to grab on.</Review>
            <Review>As in Manufactured Landscapes, the long shots of natural and man-made environments have a patterned, abstract beauty that often chafes against the ugly truth on the ground.</Review>
            <Review>It relies heavily on visuals and offers minimal context. The project has a pro-environment feeling, which comes across implicitly, not through browbeating or preaching.</Review>
            <Review>It's the majesty and beauty of water at its most pure that stays with us longest.</Review>
            <Review>At 92 minutes, the production is stately, unhurried yet crisply focused, never overstaying its welcome.</Review>
            <Review>...splits the difference between a fully immersive documentary like Leviathan and an informational special you might find on the National Geographic channel.</Review>
            <Review>Great for IMAX theatres, but it's got the hypnotic, brain-emptying quality of a lava lamp.</Review>
            <Review>Somehow or other, form and intent mesh together utterly seamlessly.</Review>
            <Review>It's not as focused as its predecessor, but its best sequences rehydrate the mind.</Review>
            <Review>Stand out scenes would work as well as stills in a photography book.</Review>
            <Review>With no narration or context, its subject matter comes across as dry, while the enviro-message is undermined by a yawn-inducing lack of urgency.</Review>

            <Review>Likely to inspire much exiting stage left and right.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director Jerome Sable, who co-wrote the songs with Eli Batalion, has a sharp ear for musical pastiche, from Andrew Lloyd Weber to heavy metal. But he comes up flat on the horror-musical spoof.</Review>
            <Review>"Stage Fright" could have been so much fun.</Review>
            <Review>Give the movie some zip, a few memorable songs and a stronger third act, and (to paraphrase Mr. Sondheim) something good's just out of reach.</Review>
            <Review>This horror musical has about 20 comically inspired minutes before devolving into increasingly moribund genre-spoofing territory.</Review>
            <Review>Whether it's being sexy, jokey or homicidal, "Stage Fright" doesn't deliver the goods with sufficient spirit. It lacks the sparkle to be a truly killer show.</Review>
            <Review>Written and directed by Jerome Sable, Stage Fright is a clever, gory and wickedly fun time that truly celebrates everything we love about horror musicals with an unabashed enthusiasm that you can't help but fall in love with.</Review>
            <Review>Clear evidence of filmmakers who love musical theater and slasher flicks in equal measure.</Review>
            <Review>Stage Fright mashes the gory whodunnit set-pieces of every slasher you've ever seen with the let's-put-on-a-show glee of, well, Glee, while throwing in easter-egg allusions to, inter alia, Psycho and Carrie.</Review>
            <Review>Stage Fright almost works as a pitch-perfect parody of '80s b-grade slashers, but succumbs to many of the genre's same weaknesses.</Review>
            <Review>Sable's slasher entry delivers a devilish wink and is surprisingly spirited in its gruesome gumption.</Review>
            <Review>With such broad comedic targets, the film would have been better off poking fun at its disparate elements instead of paying tribute.</Review>

            <Review>The film works best when it shows Jonathan Daniel Brown's drug kingpin at his most inept and incapable, rather than elevating him to a pothead martyr.</Review>
            <Review>Brown's performance as Norman goes deep enough to penetrate his protective bluster: There's more Max Fischer in him than Tony Montana. He's the reason this convincing pro-legalization editorial is also a memorable coming-of-age story.</Review>

            <Review>Pavich shows us many images from the storyboard, and even treats some to a simple form of animation to suggest how the movie might have looked.</Review>
            <Review>This documentary version of Jodorowsky's "Dune" is probably more entertaining than what Hollywood would have done to it, with a clearer message: Our lives are like sands though an hourglass, so dream the impossible dream.</Review>
            <Review>A deeply moving testament to single-minded, indefatigable commitment of creative vision and to an almost spiritual ability to let that vision go, thereby allowing it to exist in the world in an entirely unexpected form.</Review>
            <Review>Jodorowsky is a mesmerizing presence in director Frank Pavich's engrossing picture. He was 84 when much of it was shot.</Review>
            <Review>Jodorowsky's Dune gives you a good sense of what might have been, and judging by what we see, the picture might have accomplished what the director ultimately intended: "To mutate young minds."</Review>
            <Review>What an extraordinary dream it could have been.</Review>
            <Review>For lovers of visionary films, this one is a gem.</Review>
            <Review>An entertaining documentary exploration of what might have been, but also what came to be, thanks to the way the unproduced film ended up having a seminal impact on the future blockbuster landscape.</Review>
            <Review>Not just for fanboys, the documentary is both an entertaining portrait of a unique pop-culture endeavor and an ebullient salute to the creative spirit.</Review>
            <Review>Herbert's tale is twisted into a barely recognizable rush of pretentions made entertaining by Jodorowsky's glee in describing them. At age 85 he remains a madman with immense personality.</Review>
            <Review>When is a failure not a failure? This isn't a riddle or a trick question, but rather the unique scenario we're compelled to ponder while watching Jodorowsky's Dune.</Review>
            <Review>Even if Jodorowsky's movie never got made, his wide-eyed belief in the medium is refreshing in an age when cinema's possibilities feel frustratingly limited.</Review>

        <StoryLine>It doesn't take a nuclear scientist to figure out that Smith Ohrig, the character played by Robert Ryan in Caught, is a thinly disguised takeoff of Howard Hughes. But whereas Howard Hughes was merely paranoid and eccentric, Smith Ohrig is an all-out psycho. Impulsively marrying ambitious model Leonora Eames (Barbara Bel Geddes), Ohrig keeps the poor girl a virtual prisoner in his palatial mansion, tormenting her with twisted mind games while he continues his premarital playboy activities. Coming to the realization that wealth and creature comforts are no substitute for stability, Leonora takes a "normal" job in the offices of society doctor Larry Quinada (James Mason). Falling in love with her boss, Leonora nonetheless returns to Ohrig when he turns on his patented charm. Only an act of God (accelerated by Ohrig's hedonistic lifestyle) rescues Leonora from a life of lavish bondage. Billed as Max Opuls on the credits of Caught, director Max Ophuls manages to implant his own distinctive style upon what is essentially a slick Hollywood studio product. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>A dreadful sex farce with barely an authentic emotion, credible character or plausible plot point in its midst.</Review>
            <Review>This retrograde sex comedy is embarrassing for just about everyone involved ...</Review>
            <Review>The whole film is pretty enraging, hideously acted apart from the main quartet, and ends up viewing like a particularly racy Lifetime Original.</Review>
            <Review>Fortunately, not all was lost. I did laugh four times during the movie. But that hardly makes up for the pain during the rest of the time.</Review>
            <Review>For a film so bent on naturalizing the presumably hilarious incongruity of "the sexes," it sure features lots and lots of that site of horror: a naked male body. And for comedic purposes, of course.</Review>

            <Review>The worst American film I've seen this year.</Review>
            <Review>The film gets more woolly and unfocused; many scenes feel improvised and only occasionally hit their marks.</Review>
            <Review>All the controlled substances in the world couldn't improve a viewing of the execrable "Don Peyote," a tedious, incoherent look at a paranoid stoner's emotional and spiritual unraveling.</Review>
            <Review>This Don Peyote doesn't even have a windmill to tilt at.</Review>
            <Review>You feel as if, at any moment, anything could happen. The problem is, seemingly everything does.</Review>
            <Review>Where Don Peyote gets truly intriguing is when its transitions from mundane normalcy to a higher existence find their delineations gradually dissolving until we cannot tell which is which.</Review>
            <Review>... an incoherent series of hallucination sequences that are neither amusing nor visually compelling.</Review>
            <Review>It sounds dickish and empty to call Don Peyote indulgent, but the film feels so personal that it never connects to any universal feelings of panic on the part of its character or, by extension, Fogler.</Review>
            <Review>Unfortunately, Don Peyote - for all its freakout ambitions, bizarre visuals, and copious, relentless WTF moments - doesn't quite stick.</Review>
            <Review>The most surprising thing about this comedy is that it's not very funny, but then it's not meant to be. This is a trippy odyssey into the mind of a drug-addled guy who thinks the world is falling apart around him.</Review>
            <Review>Should he direct again, it is possible he will create a film worthy of his talent, and worth watching. Don Peyote, however, is as big a bust as the apocalypse of December 2012.</Review>
            <Review>To write that this is the most appealing Fogler has been on-screen to date doesn't mean much, but as scattergun, super-freak-out cinema goes, Don Peyote is almost patiently weird enough to work.</Review>

From teen romance to a decades-long marriage; newlyweds to a recent divorcee, and even a bachelor so frustrated in his search that he chooses to have children without a partner, Love Etc. documents the intimate journeys of engaging characters aged 18-89 who reflect the city's diversity, and takes an honest look at life's most challenging pursuit. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>Modern yoga, that is, the form practiced daily by tens of millions of people around the world, goes back directly to Lord Shiva according to Indian tradition. At the same time, however, modern yoga originated in the early 20th century, a creation of Indian savant T. Krishnamacharya (1888-1989). That story is far less known and is what this film is all about. Krishnamacharya's life and teachings are seen through the eyes of the director Jan Schmidt-Garre on his search for authentic yoga. His journey leads him from the legendary students and relatives of Krishnamacharya's to the source of modern yoga, at the palace of the Maharaja of Mysore. From Pattabhi Jois Jan learns the "Sun salutation," from Iyengar the "King of Asanas," the headstand, and finally Sribhashyam reveals to him his father's secret "Life Saving Yoga Session."</StoryLine>

            <Review>At best this functions as a pleasant aquatic travelogue; at worst it validates a teenage girl's egotism.</Review>
            <Review>Maidentrip is full of sunsets and dolphins but short on introspection and drama.</Review>
            <Review>Maidentrip ends up being not necessarily about the amazing feat that Dekker accomplished, it's about finding one's true self, and enjoying the ride along the way.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Based on a novel by Scott Spencer, Endless Love details the doomed romance between 17-year-old David (Martin Hewitt) and 15-year-old Jade (Brooke Shields). Banished from Jade's home by her daddy Hugh (Don Murray), David obsessively cooks up a scheme to get back into the family's good graces. Since this plan involves setting Jade's house on fire, one can easily predict that the puppy-love romance is in for a bumpy ride. Jailed for arson, David heads directly to Jade the moment that he's released, with tragic results. Posting respectable earnings thanks to the popularity of Brooke Shields, Endless Love was also the film debut of Tom Cruise, billed 18th in the cast list.

            <Review>Is Brooke Shields truly obsession worthy? And can she carry, commercially, another movie about another kind of obsession? The answer is no.</Review>
            <Review>A Cotton-candy rendition of Scott Spencer's powerful novel, Endless Love is a manipulative tale of a doomed romance which careens repeatedly between the credible and the ridiculous.</Review>
            <Review>As excruciating as the Diana Ross/Lionel Richie title tune.</Review>
            <Review>The movie as a whole does not understand the particular strengths of the novel that inspired it, does not convince us it understands adolescent love, does not seem to know its characters very well, and is a narrative and logical mess.</Review>
            <Review>Anyone unfamiliar with the story of Scott Spencer's novel is bound to be mystified by Franco Zeffirelli's latest film, which reduces Endless Love to a whimperingly latter-day Romeo and Juliet with a little pyromania thrown in.</Review>
            <Review>Trite Blue Lagoonish dialogue trivializes this film adaptation of Scott Spencer's first-rate 1979 novel of obsession but does not spoil it on the level of pop romance.</Review>
            <Review>Vaguely interesting for causing controversy at the time, this tacky tale of illicit teenage romance hasn't aged particularly well.</Review>
            <Review>A bad but commercially popular romantic melodrama, due to Brooke Shields' celeb status at the time and the the Oscar-nominated tune by Lionel Richie.</Review>
            <Review>A potentially interesting story of obsessive teenage love is sabotaged by some laughably absurd overplotting.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>117</Duration>
        <StoryLine>LULLABY explores the power of life, its transformative moments, and reconnections between loved ones. Estranged from his family, Jonathan (Hedlund) discovers his father has decided to take himself off life support in forty-eight hours' time. During this intensely condensed period, a lifetime of drama plays out. Robert (Jenkins) fights a zero sum game to reclaim all that his illness stole from his family. A debate rages on patients' rights and what it truly means to be free. Jonathan reconciles with his father, reconnects with his mother (Archer), sister (Brown-Findlay), and his love (Adams) and reclaims his voice through two unlikely catalysts - a young, wise-beyond-her-years patient (Barden) and a no-nonsense nurse (Hudson). Through this intensely life affirming prism, an unexpected and powerful journey of love, laughter, and forgiveness unfolds.(c) Arc Entertainment</StoryLine>

            <Review>A raft of fine actors -- including Amy Adams, Richard Jenkins, and Downton Abbey's Jessica Brown Findlay -- are wasted in a sour, callow family drama that mistakes constant yelling for emotional tension and fortune-cookie aphorisms for wisdom.</Review>
            <Review>A film like "Lullaby" should both enlighten and inspire debate. Instead, it feels simultaneously superficial and overbearing, albeit with a few moments that do indeed resonate.</Review>
            <Review>The digital photography is crummy, and the characters who most need to convince ... feel created out of whole cloth. Polyester cloth, at that.</Review>
            <Review>The kind of manipulative, cliché-infested hokum that alienates moviegoers by its insistence on hogging all the tears.</Review>
            <Review>With the ever-expanding number of adults able to stay alive longer because of medical advancements, quality-of-life issues are top of mind for many folks. It's the way the filmmaker makes the point that is the problem.</Review>
            <Review>A tortured weepie that can't quite figure out what sort of movie it is, "Lullaby" wears out its welcome fairly quickly.</Review>
            <Review>Lullaby is the kind of film that's best described as a having been cobbled together from an indie scrapyard.</Review>
            <Review>You'll walk away feeling sombre and slightly downtrodden but, thanks to a handful of strong performances and a strong emotional core, the central debate will linger in your mind, which is exactly what "Lullaby" sets out to do.</Review>
            <Review>Jenkins and Hedlund do great work here but it's the unnecessary supporting characters who undermine what could've been a strong drama.</Review>
            <Review>After about ten minutes of enduring this manipulative, seemingly-endless weeper you'll just wish he would go ahead and die already.</Review>
            <Review>Family reunites for dying dad in warm drama; some swearing.</Review>
            <Review>Lullaby gives a heartbreakingly realistic portrayal of the disease and not just what it does to the body, but to the family as well.</Review>

The prisoners, played by such diverse types as Elliott Gould, David Niven, and Sonny Bono, plan an escape with a group of Greek partisans (headed by Telly Savalas). It's not that the POWs are dissatisfied with life behind barbed wire -- it's just that they've been coerced into rescuing valuable art treasures from the Nazis, and there's a possibility of turning a profit! ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>...illustrates the full cycle of evolution that the genre has endured since it first creeped us out.</Review>
            <Review>Despite thinking you may know where the story is headed, it continually subverts expectations and in places it doesn't, there's at least quality entertainment.</Review>
            <Review>This isn't the most exhilarating or groundbreaking endeavor of the horror genre, yet its cinematic and visual modus operandi works like a charm.</Review>
            <Review>Rather than letting their budgetary constraints hold back their story, Prowse and Lee let their stunning visuals and compelling story do all the heavy lifting, creating a horror tale that's as scary as it is endearing.</Review>
            <Review>Afflicted may be slightly more entertaining than most others films of the same type, but it's still unable to hide the fact that it's just as empty as most of them as well.</Review>

            <Review>Lee and Prowse clearly have filmmaking abilities, but Afflicted doesn't feel complete. It's more of a cinematic sharpening stone than a deeply considered merging of genre and style.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>120</Duration>
        <StoryLine>GreasePaint is a documentary film by Daniel Espeut that follows Joey Thurmond and his family as they travel around the country performing the art of American circus clowning. The movie resurrects the dying art of clowning demonstrated by Joey's love for the craft and makes sure that people see the human side of clowning. While the over-arching story focuses on Joey and his ability to balance the business and family life, the viewer also hears from circus performers, old and new, discussing the positive and negative connotations that people have of clowns. Having started the clowning full time, Joey Thurmond has put his life savings and police pension into his ultimate passion. He overhauls the new show completely with a new background, traveling set, and living quarters. The family starts the year not knowing whether they will have enough money to make it back home from the road. His wife, Jamie, manages a lot of the day to day affairs and keeps the peace in the family. Joey's son, Tyler, weighs his options of staying with the business or pursuing his own dreams. Hernan Colonia, a late-comer to the show works on adjusting to his new surroundings and unfortunate immigration situation. The movie is a glimpse into a year of traveling in the most significant and dynamic year in the business' history while examining the clowning world as a whole. The audience sees the backstories of quite a few of the characters including Joey's rise from professional wrestler, to police officer, to clown. It is about the love of a family and how they manage to live and work together 24 hours a day while following their circus dreams.</StoryLine>

        <Duration>123</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Cardinal Releasing Ltd., MVD Entertainment Group, and Syndctd Entertainment are pleased to announce the US release of The Life of Riley, the much-lauded feature documentary film on the extraordinary life of Blues legend B.B. King. King worked closely with Director Jon Brewer for 2 years to create this powerful film. The heartfelt contributions from a plethora of music's superstars were a vast indication that this was the time for his story to be told. At 88 years old, King, his family, friends and contemporaries unveil the true-life drama that was the springboard for the future 'King of the Blues'. Battling unrelenting racism and the humiliation of segregation whilst working in the cotton fields as an orphaned child, King lived to overcome the toughest critics in the entertainment industry and ultimately be hailed as one of the kingpins of an entire genre of music. This candid biopic of the life story of one of our living legends is highlighted by rare archive footage and beautifully shot scenes of the deep American south. Informative and visually stunning, The Life of Riley is the definitive document of a true American treasure. (c) MCD</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>A group of aging rockers pull a fast one on the youth-obsessed music industry by hiring a group of photogenic teenagers as their stand ins, and releasing a scorching punk-pop single that rockets up the charts in this comedy inspired by actual events. Back in his day, Johnny Jones (Phil Daniels) and his band The Weapons of Happiness were all the rage. A few decades later, they're just a bunch of old, out-of-work musicians reminiscing about the glory days. Then one day, during a particularly inspired jam session, The Weapons of Happiness crank out a tune that's a surefire hit. Trouble is, every record executive and DJ they approach rejects them as too old and tired to turn out a hit. But that only fuels Johnny's determination to prove his detractors wrong, and when the band recruits a group of fresh young faces as their media proxies, The Weapons of Happiness find themselves in the midst of a unexpected comeback. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>Koreeda's film never feels gimmicky; he uses the situation to examine both nature and nurture while dealing with ties that simply can't be broken. "Like Father, Like Son" ponders the meaning of family.</Review>

            <Review>There's nothing wildly original here, but it's carried off with charm and wit, and a pair of very enjoyable central performances.</Review>
            <Review>A lovely little film from a place where the little things linger.</Review>
            <Review>"The Lunchbox" doesn't offer easy solutions, but it is filled with keen observations. All meals should be this satisfying.</Review>
            <Review>A pleasure, from the fascinating intricacies of Mumbai-style interlocking lunch containers to the quietly masterful performance of Khan.</Review>
            <Review>Warm, and warmly predictable.</Review>
            <Review>"The Lunchbox" is a feast of delights, one of the best stories about the connection between food and love the movies have ever seen.</Review>
            <Review>This is not a comedy that delivers its humour broadly or a romance that seeks to induce a swoon; it has a restrained, even melancholic tone that dilutes its essential sentimentalism. There's a lot to be said for that.</Review>
            <Review>Melancholic wit - and a tone of restrained melodrama - is what makes Ritesh Batra's The Lunchbox a small gem.</Review>
            <Review>The perfect date film, guaranteed.</Review>
            <Review>Batra allows Ila and Sajaan's relationship to develop slowly and subtly, like an old photograph, and the tender humor adds exactly the right amount of spice to what is already a delicious mix of melancholy and hope.</Review>
            <Review>It dragged for me a tiny bit towards the end but, generally, I really enjoyed it.</Review>
            <Review>Somewhere in [its] moments of joy, lies the film's optimistic message about life, and how it should be lived. Which sounds syrupy, but it's far from it. It's magical.</Review>

            <Review>Morris is admirably evenhanded, never demonizing his subject, but giving him enough rope to hang himself. Rumsfeld, cool and bemused, refuses to knot the noose.</Review>
            <Review>[A] scary inquiry.</Review>
            <Review>By now the director's technique is so savvy, so confident in its visual layering and atmospheric assurance, even a dodgy, cagey camera subject such as Rumsfeld becomes movieworthy.</Review>
            <Review>Morris doesn't "break" Rumsfeld, as some think he did McNamara. He has held a mirror up to the man, and found no reflection. The viewer simply has to realize that what's important is what's not there.</Review>
            <Review>What emerges is a fascinating portrait of a bygone approach to power, marked by a seemingly contradictory mix of transparency and obfuscation. Rumsfeld embodies that discrepancy.</Review>
            <Review>A portrait of a wartime leader determined to avoid, at any cost, an honest perspective.</Review>
            <Review>He poses simple questions and lets them talk, and talk, and talk. In doing so, he gives them enough rope to hang themselves.</Review>
            <Review>Frustrating and fascinating.</Review>
            <Review>Delights in exploring sophistry and fine distinctions of language.</Review>
            <Review>It's about how human beings make horrific mistakes sometimes without ever understanding why ... and without ever once thinking they did.</Review>
            <Review>Part political portrait, part Iraq war post-mortem, part interrogation, it's a fascinating look at a man who -- like it or not -- will go down in history.</Review>
            <Review>This documentary interview with Bush-era insider Donald Rumsfeld is like a horror movie with a calm sociopath at its center.</Review>

Olivia is 9 years old, severely malnourished and handicapped. Her condition is life threatening. Believing her injuries to be the result of witchcraft, Olivia's mother had been hiding her for years.

This diagnosis has severe consequences. Originally from deep in the Liberian jungle, Olivia and her mother are shunned from their tribe for seeking outside help.

        <StoryLine>Directed by Manuel Carballo, THE RETURNED is set in a post-zombie world where a treatment called the "Return Protein" can stop the spread of the virus if injected quickly after infection, but cannot cure it. With daily injections, the "Returned" are able to live relatively normal lives, but with brutal attacks at the hands of Anti-Return groups and rumors that protein stock is running low, the world is again on the brink of chaos. In the midst of this turmoil are Alex (Kris Holden-Reid) and Kate (Emily Hampshire), a young, successful and enviable couple that are hiding a long held secret - Alex is Returned. Suspicious that a government order for all the Returned to report to a secure medical facility 'for their own safety', the couple flees, taking with them all the doses of "Return Protein" they have. Now in a race against the clock and few places to turn, they must face their worst fears and come to grips with the reality that if they are neither human nor zombies, who exactly are the Returned? --(C) levelFilm</StoryLine>

            <Review>This is a serious, austere film that feels as if it's barely restraining the B-movie within. In the end, it fights itself to a draw.</Review>
            <Review>Carballo also fails to capitalize on the climate of paranoia the script attempts to engender throughout.</Review>
            <Review>Carballo offsets the lack of surprise with such efficient suspense builders as propulsive music, ambient noise, realistic lighting and judicious handheld camerawork while efficiently explaining the science and politics behind what is happening.</Review>
            <Review>Pivotal scenes dive too deep into melodrama, and there's something inevitably sterile about a script that includes only scenes that propel the plot or provide obvious foreshadowing.</Review>
            <Review>Though an admirable shake-up of the typically overbearing, munch-intensive undead yarn, "The Returned" is still a far cry from the smarts-and-shocks zombie allegories George Romero mastered.</Review>
            <Review>Carballo squeezes an impressive amount of exposition into news reports and medical briefings, but Holden-Ried's and Hampshire's performances are what ground the film ...</Review>
            <Review>Director Manuel Carballo seems to be trying for the psychological unease of Blindness, or perhaps of something by Cronenberg, but it's never more than artificial terror wrapped in bland social commentary.</Review>
            <Review>Cuttingly sharp and incisive SF horror; a chillingly polite film about the fascism that rises quickly up in a moment of fearful crisis.</Review>
            <Review>A zombie movie in which the normal people are to be feared. Modest in scope, but very effective.</Review>
            <Review>The Returned is a zombie movie without the zombies, generating scares through social commentary and human nature, which actually makes for a welcome change of pace.</Review>
            <Review>Refreshingly intelligent, subversive and psychologically terrifying. It's much more than your average zombie film.</Review>
            <Review>Marred by obvious plot developments...and a disappointingly lazy reliance on the very clichés the movie mostly tries to avoid...The Returned is never quite clever or confident enough to become the subversive zombie film it wants to be.</Review>

            <Review>As a portrait of encroaching mental illness, For Those in Peril works superbly.</Review>

            <Review>Although more than a little meandering and self-indulgent, the film is likeable nonetheless due to its incisive characterizations and canny capturing of true-life moments.</Review>
            <Review>While these loose ends might sound like scrambled bits out of an Eric Rohmer film, Mr. Maren's movie rather finds its groove in its humble domestic detail.</Review>
            <Review>Lavin is a treasure. But Erika is right - Nathan's neurotic self-indulgence strains our patience.</Review>
            <Review>Not a lot happens, and yet, as in the best so-called "slice of life" stories, you feel one way of life ending and another struggling to be born. The little that happens is enough.</Review>
            <Review>Modest but winsome.</Review>
            <Review>Maren's script isn't deep, but it's heartfelt without being sticky, suggesting that the best way to deal with aging parents is to savor every tender frustration while you can.</Review>
            <Review>There is nothing to inherently dislike in A Short History of Decay, but neither is there anything to love.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director Michael Maren takes on a subject that is affecting baby-boomers all over the world...and he does so with a certain necessary seriousness and sensitivity. The problem here is that his film is neither very deep nor particularly moving.</Review>
            <Review>[The] film desperately tries to mine sweetness from the banality of life's endgame, but the falseness of its bittersweet storytelling only accentuates the misery.</Review>
            <Review>The film flourishes when it moves away from a coming-of-age story to a more family ensemble piece.</Review>
            <Review>A satisfying little film that keeps surprising you with its ability to tell recognizable truths in an original and human way.</Review>
            <Review>Mix of younger generation and older one provides an unusual involving story both humorous and heartbreaking. Aspiring writer finds new romance and also new insight into his ailing parents movingly played by Linda Lavin and Harris Yulin.</Review>

With his sister drifting in and out of jobs and relationships, twelve-year-old Simon takes on the responsibility of providing for the two of them. Every day, he takes the lift up to the opulent ski world above, stealing equipment from rich tourists to resell to the local kids down in the valley.

            <Review>What a beautiful and desperate film.</Review>
            <Review>[An] absorbing French drama.</Review>
            <Review>The movie takes a refreshingly low-key, observational approach to storytelling ...</Review>
            <Review>"Sister" avoids sentimental indulgence. There's no room for wallowing in this spare, almost ascetic exercise ...</Review>
            <Review>French-born director and co-screenwriter Ursula Meier balances the scenario's bleak, wrenching aspects with a stirring confidence in the redemptive power of love.</Review>
            <Review>Seydoux perfectly captures the anger and self-defeat of ill-educated, hedonistic, man-chasing young women who live on the fringes.</Review>
            <Review>It's a Dardennes-like move that Meier makes here, plunking us down, without judgment, in the middle of a low life. Just 13 here, Klein, who debuted in Meier's Home at 10 as the son Julien (a name he uses here as an alias) is remarkable.</Review>
            <Review>The pair [Klein &amp; Seydoux] artfully weaves the ties that bind, crafting something that is both fragile and tenuously hopeful.</Review>
            <Review>Strong, pungent, snow-laden contemporary Swiss drama...Director Ursula Meier fills the film with unspoken desperation that is almost tear-inducing.</Review>
            <Review>Scorn may give way to momentary solicitude, but Sister is by no means a tenderhearted morality tale.</Review>
            <Review>One of those films that quietly gets under your skin - in the best possible way. It's a film about character and relationships. And its unpredictability is what adds the dramatic tension</Review>
            <Review>The content gets grittier and grittier as the film progresses and some may be disappointed by the ending, which leaves us hanging - as if on a mountain ledge. But maybe that is the point. Performances are brilliant, though</Review>

            <Review>On a purely narrative level, Winter's Tale missteps early and often. Its earnestness is its downfall, resulting in opportunities for unintentional humor.</Review>
            <Review>The film version of "Winter's Tale" probably won't please anyone: neither fans of the book nor those who have never read it.</Review>
            <Review>We never come to understand the magic that keeps Farrell looking like a member of My Chemical Romance for 10 decades. We never know why consumption makes women sexy.</Review>
            <Review>It's so filled with high-flown blather about love, destiny and miracles that there's no room for enchantment.</Review>
            <Review>If only there was less mush and more meat in this stew.</Review>
            <Review>Winter's Tale is preposterous twaddle. Use it as a date movie only if you don't love the one you're with.</Review>
            <Review>There are so many ideas floating around in Winter's Tale, it feels like Goldsman is simply trying to keep up with his own film.</Review>
            <Review>A total suspension of belief is required because your brain says it's not working while your heart wants to say, "but I want this to work". And yes. I am a sucker for a horse with wings.</Review>
            <Review>The only way to even potentially sell any of this was to play it so straight that it hurts a little, and Akiva Goldsman and crew did that, even when it broke the film.</Review>
            <Review>Exquisitely awful. I was reminded of M. Night Shyamalan's Lady in the Water, in that both are attempts at building a magical fantasy world by someone who has no clue whatsoever how to go about the task.</Review>
            <Review>This is an adaptation that simply doesn't have much of anything that is engaging about it, leading to two hours that end up being more of a slog than the celebration of life and love it should have been.</Review>
            <Review>"What the hell did I just see?" That was my first comment to the studio representative after I screened "Winter's Tale." Allow me to save you two hours. of your life:</Review>

        <StoryLine>Years after a drunken car crash that almost took his life, Tommy Carter has reinvented himself as a therapist/spiritual advisor who advocates a synthesis of world religions and positivity. He's parlayed this vocation into a successful book release that one day draws the attention of Angel Sanchez, a profoundly troubled man fixated on the "untimely" death of his mother. When Carter takes on Sanchez as a personal client in an effort to raise funds for his indebted brother Ben, things quickly take a turn for the worse. Angel needs much more than a simple life coach. -- (C) Lionsgate</StoryLine>

            <Review>Despite some flaws and frustrations, this is one movie whose ending you will not see coming.</Review>
            <Review>Enemy is a bewilderingly skillful metaphysical thriller combining Swiss-watch engineering and surrealism, like one of Dali's melted timepieces.</Review>
            <Review>Movies about doubles are, almost by definition, creepy, but Villeneuve, not to be outdone, piles on the weirdness.</Review>
            <Review>"Enemy" is what might happen if someone let Terrence Malick make a "Twilight Zone" episode, with a quick rewrite by David Cronenberg.</Review>

            <Review>For those who enjoy a different kind of cinema, this is not to be missed.</Review>
            <Review>As with many Gyllenhaal flicks, a huge amount goes unsaid - such as what is going on.</Review>

            <Review>"Wolf Creek 2" is gory, disturbing, inventive, twisted and rather well made.</Review>
            <Review>A fast-moving, lean killing machine that will delight genre fans.</Review>
            <Review>As well made as it is, it would be great to see what McLean could do if he were free from genre conventions and could put his many talents to use in a movie not built around beheadings and dismemberments.</Review>
            <Review>Mick has been reimagined as a chortling, xenophobic butcher who enjoys a singalong of "Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport" and dismembers his victims with the help of Patsy Cline's "I Fall to Pieces."</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately the sequel's raisons d'être seem to be emulating superior movies, from "Deliverance" to "Joy Ride" to "Saw."</Review>
            <Review>Starts out strong and unpredictable -- and then slowly (very slowly) runs out of steam.</Review>
            <Review>Wolf Creek 2 both deconstructs and perpetuates the myth of boorishly ugly hospitality Down Under, creating a monster who is a distorted yet recognisable part of the Australian character (especially in the current political climate).</Review>
            <Review>A brutal and admirably grueling serial-killer thriller, this Australian import is also repetitive and ultimately a little dull.</Review>
            <Review>Its grindhouse appeal will be enough for some audiences, but I sometimes require more of a statement to be made other than "It hurts when outback psychopaths stab you a bunch."</Review>
            <Review>Jarratt's outward Outback schtick is designed to entrap, but even without the soft sell approach, the genius of Mclean's creation is that he's part and parcel of the brutal landscape.</Review>
            <Review>Wolf Creek 2 is far more ambitious and biting than any sequel in a very long time.</Review>

            <Review>It's a story so outlandish that it needs to be served by a combination of drama and comedy, and "Rob the Mob" finds that balance quite well.</Review>
            <Review>As Tommy and Rosie, Pitt and Arianda are just the right kind of nuts, the right kind of dumb, the right kind of desperate and the right kind of in love to make it all go down like pie.</Review>
            <Review>De Felitta has a feel for this world and its atmosphere, from the clutter and casual ugliness of the streets, to the insularity of the mentality, to the unexpected sweetness and vulnerability of the people.</Review>
            <Review>One of the pleasures of Rob the Mob, director Raymond De Felitta's serio-comic crime drama, is watching Pitt and Arianda as the rambunctious, lovestruck pair who can't believe the scam they've stumbled upon.</Review>
            <Review>"Rob the Mob" skims over the lifted-from-the-headlines exploits of an outlaw couple and gleans a humanist drama steeped in sentimentality.</Review>
            <Review>A romance about two down-and-outers that reveals the workings of a whole citywide ecosystem of crime and punishment.</Review>
            <Review>Offbeat crime drama Rob the Mob hits just the right semi-comic tone to pull off its outlandish, stranger-than-fiction true story.</Review>
            <Review>By far one of the most fun mob thrillers we've seen in some time.</Review>

            <Review>Don't be surprised if, two weeks from now, you forget it ever existed.</Review>
            <Review>Long on crimson spurts of blood but low on character, larded with production value but bereft of any other kind of it, "300: Rise of an Empire' is a 3D joke.</Review>
            <Review>There is much grinding of teeth, and mauling of history, and anachronistic use of gunpowder, until we plug our ears and desperately pray to the gods of Olympus, or the brothers of Warner, that they might make an end.</Review>
            <Review>If the movie's action recalls video games, the dramatically artificial lighting suggests 1980s rock videos. Indeed, Rise of an Empire is so campy that it might work better as a musical.</Review>
            <Review>Eva Green delights as the cunning Artemesia, so dominating every scene she's in that Empire almost feels as if it is her story rather than a tale of Greek freedom.</Review>
            <Review>For a film that's trying to outdo its predecessor in every way possible, Rise falls a bit short. It still looks glorious, retaining that distinctive chromatic style and gloomy colour palette for that essential comic-book look.</Review>
            <Review>Just by avoiding the haze of perfunctoriness that envelops so many sequels, "300: Rise Of An Empire" is a success.</Review>
            <Review>300: Rise of an Empire therefore becomes a tedious slog of repetitive callbacks not only to its predecessor but also itself.</Review>
            <Review>Tries hard to follow in Snyder's footsteps - plenty of speed-ramping slow-mo action - but it just comes across as an imitator.</Review>
            <Review>Black Sabbath's War Pigs coats the end credits in the aural equivalent of liquid metal, the final guilty pleasure of a senses-battering 106 minutes of military mayhem.</Review>

            <Review>Chiemi Karasawa deserves all the credit in the world for the intimate and hilarious portrait that is Elaine Stritch: Shoot Me, a sparkling cocktail of music and memoir. On the other hand, she didn't exactly have to drag her subject out of her shell.</Review>
            <Review>[A] feisty portrait of the musical-theater legend.</Review>
            <Review>"Elaine Stritch" is filled with bluster and memories, blunt outbursts and funny moments. But more importantly, it is filled with honesty.</Review>
            <Review>Elaine Stritch's strength, along with the film's, comes from her honesty. She is herself, even when - maybe especially when - she knows she's being watched.</Review>
            <Review>What a tough, difficult, talented old broad.</Review>
            <Review>Really, the experience of "Elaine Stritch: Shoot Me" is the experience of being in Stritch's company for 80 minutes, and that's fine. Still I doubt anyone will walk out of this film wishing it were 10 minutes longer.</Review>
            <Review>There's something indomitable about her will to perform, and insecurity has been part of her experience for decades, it's clear.</Review>
            <Review>For someone who made her Broadway debut 68 years ago, Elaine Stritch is still quite the firecracker.</Review>
            <Review>As we see Stritch carry on, still performing into her eighties, battling the physical and mental ravages of time, it's obvious she was no sissy.</Review>
            <Review>Shoot Me is precisely as dishy, vulnerable and moving as a biographical doc ought to be.</Review>
            <Review>Sensationally entertaining.</Review>
            <Review>This film works as both a show business historical documentary and a fitting tribute to the late, great Broadway legend, Elaine Stritch.</Review>

            <Review>Seems to be the continuation of a narrative that only exists in its characters' heads.</Review>
            <Review>I share Canet's affection for Sidney Lumet films full of scraggly sideburns and big brown Fleetwoods the size of the QE2. But if you really appreciated those movies, you'd use your memories of them to jumpstart something new.</Review>
            <Review>If you're an ardent admirer of pretty much anyone in the cast (OK, except Emmerich), you'll find something worthwhile here.</Review>
            <Review>The performers carry on - Owen is particularly good - but this bird doesn't fly.</Review>
            <Review>An ambitious, if disappointing, period crime drama featuring Clive Owen and Billy Crudup as warring brothers on opposite sides of the law.</Review>
            <Review>Canet delivers a character-centered thriller that doesn't break so much as an inch of new ground.</Review>
            <Review>Everything is in place to have created a truly sensational piece of cinema, and yet you can't help feeling somewhat cold towards this film, despite the memorable, impactful finale.</Review>
            <Review>While the story centres on twisted moral dilemmas, this 1970s-set thriller takes such a hesitant, internalised approach that if never lets viewers under the characters' skin.</Review>
            <Review>The film is too sprawling and unfocused to deliver real emotional clout, but there are are some gripping stand-offs along the way.</Review>
            <Review>In its lesser moments, the film is overwrought and derivative but, at its best, it has a real flavour of Friedkin, Coppola and Scorsese.</Review>
            <Review>It starts out feeling like too many stars in search of a story, but Owen excels as a charismatic brute, and the tautly handled set pieces drag you back in for a solid payoff.</Review>

            <Review>Supremely well-intentioned, low-budget British comedy which, with all the will in the world, a likeable cast can't quite power to greatness.</Review>
            <Review>Still has lots of very funny moments and a realistic interpretation of the lengths some people go to when confronted by a camera lens and under ... pressure to perform.</Review>
            <Review>It's not a bad production, but the excitement of its concept soon wears off - largely because wedding movies are so old hat these days. And who wears old hats at a wedding?</Review>
            <Review>Except for a very silly ending, his film goes down as easily as a glass of bubbly.</Review>
            <Review>A compendium of every terrible wedding experience and joke you ever heard (including the bride's teenage reputation for drugs and promiscuity), it's crude, broad and moderately funny.</Review>
            <Review>The found-footage gimmick has become a tired cliché in the horror genre but it receives a new jolt of energy in this sprightly romantic comedy thanks to the comic spark provided by a clutch of big-and-small screen British stars.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Of the great ballerinas, Tanaquil Le Clercq may have been the most transcendent. She mesmerized viewers and choreographers alike - her elongated, race-horse physique became the new prototype for the great George Balanchine. The muse to both Balanchine and Jerome Robbins, they loved her as a dancer and a woman. Balanchine married her and Robbins created his famous Afternoon of a Faun for Tanny. She was the foremost dancer of her day until it suddenly all stopped. At age 27, Tanny was struck down by polio and paralyzed. She never danced again. (c) Kino Lorber</StoryLine>

            <Review>It is the mythic resonance of her story that makes it a worthy subject a documentary. But it is the down-to-earth human touches that make "Afternoon of a Faun: Tanaquil Le Clercq" worth watching.</Review>
            <Review>"Afternoon of a Faun: Tanaquil Le Clercq" presents enough teasing glimpses into the dancer's personal and inner life to demand a fuller picture.</Review>
            <Review>This 2013 profile of famed ballerina Tanaquil Le Clercq divides its running time between biographical information and synopses of creative achievements, but it doesn't aspire to anything more than the sum of its parts.</Review>
            <Review>LeClerq, who lived her later years with a fierce independence, died in 2001; in this thoughtful, quiet film, she lives on.</Review>
            <Review>Afternoon of a Faun is primarily the story of a woman loved, desired, objectified and watched by men.</Review>
            <Review>It interviews friends and confidants, provides glimpses of what she was like as a person and, best of all, shows us clips of her dancing, which tell us so much of what we need to know.</Review>
            <Review>The film would be valuable for collecting this footage... even if its lapses as documentary cinema and storytelling device were far more serious than they are.</Review>
            <Review>A beautiful tribute to a rare artist with an even rarer spirit.</Review>
            <Review>As tragedy of the woman whose whole life was the hothouse of the dance -- including narrating her wistful, matter-of-fact letters and journals during treatment -- the doc exploring the myth of Le Clercq will be a balletomane's delight.</Review>
            <Review>Reminds us what the ballet world had for a time.</Review>
            <Review>A hopelessly insular work [that] affirms the talent of its subject, but frustratingly fails to establish a cleanly delineated backdrop or emotional throughline for a general audience.</Review>
            <Review>A fascinating story of American ballet and one of the greatest ballerinas in the world.</Review>

        <Duration>89</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Renown Rock &amp; Roll photographer Kevin Mazur has pulled together an impressive team for his first feature-length documentary about the changing face of celebrity and the many ways that the media has conveyed, defined and even demeaned what it means to be famous today. Taking a historical ride through the early days of Hollywood and the rise of the paparazzi, Sellebrity explores how fame has changed from the highly-structured studio system to the current free-for-all press and paparazzi frenzy. Candid interviews with Jennifer Aniston, Elton John, Jennifer Lopez, Salma Hayek, Sara Jessica Parker and Kid Rock among others, help to give a glimpse into the lives of those on the front lines of our increasingly obsessive world of pop culture celebrity. Fame is now a national pastime, it is what millions of us follow, believe in and seemingly what we care about most - as well as a billion dollar-a-year industry. But what does our intense fascination with celebrity say about us? And how much is too high a price to pay for our own curiosity run rampant? Sellebrity captures the free-for-all of pop culture today and the ever-changing face of fame.(c) Official site</StoryLine>

            <Review>Nicholas Winton is a figure who deserves a worthy documentary in his name; unfortunately, Matej Minac's Nicky's Family only gets about halfway there.</Review>
            <Review>In addition to the force and the officialdom, dizzying and stark, there are particularly sharp stabs of feeling.</Review>
            <Review>The unfathomable tragedy of the Holocaust is beyond the scope of "Nicky's Family," and even as the credits roll, Winton's simple decency is as mysterious as ever.</Review>
            <Review>An enthralling documentary by Matej Minac...</Review>
            <Review>What's nettlesome about director Matej Minac's clunkily constructed documentary is what it says about our perverse but understandable need to spin some kind of happy ending onto the Holocaust.</Review>
            <Review>Hokey reenactments of the war years do the film no favors, but it's worth sticking them out to witness a humanity that never could be faked.</Review>
            <Review>Nicky's story is now accessible and for that the film is a grand success.</Review>
            <Review>He's been dubbed "Britain's Schindler." However, instead of the Spielberg treatment, Nicky's Family gives Winton something more like a Heritage Minute, complete with kitschy, misbegotten re-enactments.</Review>
            <Review>The documentary gets heavy handed with the contemporary material, but the actual story is one that deserves to be told.</Review>
            <Review>Equally heartbreaking, informative and heartwarming. Unless you're made of stone, you will not be dry eyed by the time the end credits roll. It's easily accessible for all ages.</Review>
            <Review>A great true story and a great man come together in this real heart-warmer of a documentary.</Review>
            <Review>This is a powerful chapter in our human history, but it's made melodramatic and dull through Matej Minac's indulgence of hokey reenactments and sound-augmented archival footage.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>86</Duration>
        <StoryLine>In the next few decades, humankind will need to double, or even triple energy production as billions of people in the developing world lift themselves out of poverty and begin to live modern lives. Unless the source of this new energy is clean and non-CO2 emitting, the risk of triggering a devastating global climate catastrophe is all but certain. The magnitude of this dilemma, and the limitations of commonly proposed solutions, have left the mainstream environmental movement teetering between apocalyptic thinking and utter disarray. Plunging headfirst into this challenge comes PANDORA'S PROMISE, the highly anticipated and debated new film by acclaimed documentary filmmaker Robert Stone that recently premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. Three years in the making and filmed on four continents, this meticulously researched and beautifully crafted film asks whether the most viable option we have to tackle climate change might be the one technology we fear the most: nuclear power.

            <Review>Like so many campaigning docs this is much more interested in throwing darts at the other guys than giving us a balanced film.</Review>
            <Review>Intelligent, possibly important, definitely counterintuitive -- but needs more reporting and context.</Review>
            <Review>The film's tone is boosterish, and the cursory treatment of the cost of a nuclear-based energy overhaul, or the viability of renewable energy, tends to arouse skepticism rather than allay it.</Review>
            <Review>There's not much in the way of balance in this often bone-dry documentary about the bum rap nuclear power has gotten thanks to misinformed, if well-meaning, environmentalists and energy experts.</Review>
            <Review>Documenting how five authors changed from anti- to pro-nuke energy stances, Stone is less persuasive at translating this logic into reality.</Review>
            <Review>In the end, its somewhat equivocal message - that nuclear power might just be the lesser of several evils - is more convincing than you'd think.</Review>
            <Review>Pandora's Promise gives up enough information to tease the curiosity of doubting individuals but unfortunately as a piece of subversive, cogent filmmaking - it's a box of empty promises.</Review>
            <Review>It's a shame so few people see documentaries, and that so few politicians pay them any attention, because this film has the power to change the way we think about nuclear energy.</Review>
            <Review>Robert Stone's fascinating documentary makes a convincing case for a nuclear future.</Review>
            <Review>Thoroughly engaging thanks to its strong editing and startling facts, but the film feels a little conceited thanks to its one-sided argument.</Review>
            <Review>The director paints a partisan picture, but offers an eloquent and effective challenge to orthodox eco-wisdom.</Review>
            <Review>This documentary, from Robert Stone, sets out to think the unthinkable and ask the unaskable: should we learn to stop worrying and love nuclear energy?</Review>

        <StoryLine>Newcomer Jack Reynor (to be seen in the upcoming Transformers sequel) and R�is�n Murphy star alongside Sam Keeley (The Other Side of Sleep, Misfits), and Lars Mikkelsen ("The Killing") in this striking portrait adapted from Kevin Powers' award-winning book "Bad Day in Blackrock." The world is bright and everything seems possible for Richard Karlsen (Reynor), the golden boy of his privileged set of Dublin teens, until he does something that destroys it all and shatters the lives of the people closest to him. Featuring extraordinary performances from its largely young cast, What Richard Did is a quietly devastating study of a boy confronting the gap between who he thought he was and who he proves to be.

            <Review>You may be shocked by your own reactions to "what Richard did," but you won't soon forget the movie in which he did them.</Review>
            <Review>Abrahamson's penetrating film asks - and does not answer - whether one viciously criminal moment is an aberration, or whether it reveals the weak, shabby person who was there all along.</Review>
            <Review>Mr. Reynor's portrayal of this man-child is an extraordinary screen performance in which his face registers all the conflicting emotions gripping Richard. We see every layer of him, from the scared inner child to the suave, entitled ladies' man.</Review>
            <Review>[Feels] like a Bergman homage without earning the clunky label "Bergmanesque."</Review>
            <Review>A satisfyingly knotted moral fable with some very memorable performances, including a fine piece of charismatic brooding from Reynor.</Review>
            <Review>A low-key but compelling morality tale.</Review>
            <Review>Newcomer Jack Reynor gives a startling, star-making performance in the slow-burn Irish drama What Richard Did... Consider this indie his Queens Boulevard, if you will.</Review>
            <Review>Isn't shocking in obvious ways, preferring to stun the audience with an authentic atmosphere of guilt and indecision, investing in the frustration of delayed response over unapologetic manipulation.</Review>
            <Review>The film's structure as a character study helps to subtly underscore the flawed justifications of a privileged kid's thought patterns and unchallenged value system.</Review>
            <Review>It is a familiar story, but one handled with subtly and compassion.</Review>
            <Review>With brilliant economy Abrahamson implies that in the case of his nation, as with his film's protagonist, all that glitters is not gold.</Review>
            <Review>Not only is this Irish drama sharply well written and directed, but it also features a jaw-dropping breakout performance by young Irish actorJack Reynor.</Review>

            <Review>With Some Velvet Morning, LaBute returns to the provocative style that made his name.</Review>
            <Review>Though LaBute wrote this for the screen, I mistakenly decided that it must have originated onstage... because the oblique, heavily freighted dialogue seems too elegant and artful for a medium dominated by hacks.</Review>
            <Review>A sad example of what sometimes happens when a writer of gripping stage plays controls his own independent movie to his own selfish, labored self-satisfaction.</Review>
            <Review>I came away from this malevolent exercise with the sense that these two add up to little more than the sum of their awfulness.</Review>
            <Review>This smallest of films marks a welcome return to the world of interpersonal miniature for the writer-director. I hope he stays here a while.</Review>
            <Review>Well worth watching and arguing over.</Review>
            <Review>Some might view the end as a cruel prank at the expense of moviegoers while others might consider it a cop-out, but perhaps the point of it all is that we should not rush to judgment when it comes to Mr. LaBute's theater of cruelty.</Review>
            <Review>Some Velvet Morning is at best a missed opportunity and mercifully, a short one.</Review>
            <Review>The look of Some Velvet Morning remains clean and flat, the decor [is] mostly hotel-room neutral. The major visual idea is to have Eve's red dress and lipstick stand out against a monochromatic backdrop: effective in itself, but not enough.</Review>
            <Review>Stanley Tucci and Alice Eve waste their time and ours in a dreadful, boring two-hander about a man who leaves his wife for his much younger mistress.</Review>
            <Review>It's a tantalising walk on the dark side and LaBute is the ultimate manipulator: I was enthralled, repulsed and intrigued, often feeling like a voyeur peering into a labyrinth of intimacies</Review>
            <Review>This cliché ridden film is a staggering disappointment: a morally offensive, done-on-the-cheap movie with a lifeless single location.</Review>

She enjoys a happy family life with her mother, her husband, daughter and granddaughter. But when a lawyer asks her and her mother to witness in a trial against the Norwegian state on behalf of the war children, she resists. Gradually, a web of concealments and secrets is unveiled, until Katrine is finally stripped of everything, and her loved ones are forced to take a stand: What carries more weight, the life they have lived together, or the lie it is based on?

            <Review>The personal drama is "I can't tell any more lies!" obvious, the international intrigue is lukewarm, and the big payoff, which should be a shocker, is so poorly staged as to be laughable.</Review>
            <Review>"Two Lives" is an absorbing, well-acted, moderately suspenseful mystery, although its time line of events is fuzzy to the point of impenetrability.</Review>
            <Review>Two Lives unfolds in a slow boil of rage at the government that allowed all this emotional destruction. But Maas treats Katrine with compassion, as a victim of forces more damaging than her own ravenous hunger for love and family.</Review>
            <Review>This sober look into how war, peace and politics splintered lives is circuitous, but worth puzzling out.</Review>
            <Review>For an issue movie "Two Lives" is something of a nail-biter.</Review>
            <Review>Seven decades later, the creative well has somehow not yet run dry on the ripple effects of Nazi Germany's offenses, though writer-director Georg Maas's slick and sulky second feature is not another dime-a-dozen Holocaust tragedy.</Review>
            <Review>The gradual unraveling of [a woman's] identity is suspenseful and sympathetically reveals the true pain of being an abused pawn of the losing sides of history.</Review>
            <Review>Satisfactorily tragic and pained, Two Lives is sharp work that develops spellbinding turns of plot as it unfolds.</Review>
            <Review>The real-life subject matter and strong collection of performances are enough to compensate for a muddled script overwrought with contrivances and flashbacks.</Review>
            <Review>This isn't a film that bothers to hand-hold; it's too busy bubbling with deep-rooted anger at the callousness it examines.</Review>
            <Review>Two Lives adds up to the kind of immersive, intelligent entertainment many audiences crave and too rarely get.</Review>
            <Review>The film's educational impetus is to announce to the world that even picture-perfect Norwegians continue to pay a heavy price for the horrors of WWII.</Review>

            <Review>Not only the definitive American documentary about the war in Vietnam but a landmark political action.</Review>
            <Review>Hearts and Minds is a tough film but it is no mere rehash of sad events. It is always aware of the primacy of man when man's given even half a chance.</Review>
            <Review>A reminder of how the best documentaries can resonate years after their release.</Review>
            <Review>We're bludgeoned by the point of view, we don't like the feeling of manipulation we get. Yet there are scenes here of incredible power, even for a nation which watched this war on television every evening.</Review>
            <Review>It's one of the best documentaries ever made, a superb film about the thoughts and feelings of the era, the whole festering, spirited animus of it.</Review>
            <Review>Davis's film seems as much a prosecution of the present as it is of the recent past; only the names and geographies have been changed.</Review>
            <Review>The urgency of Hearts and Minds, its anger and its articulation, its insistence that effects of war be visible, and its cogent analysis of connections among politics, media, and the military, all seem apt lessons for today.</Review>
            <Review>Davis' visual argument overwhelms rationality.This was the beginning of Red/Blue antagonism -- turning benighted patriotism against an opponent's humanity.</Review>
            <Review>It's Michael Moore's favorite documentary. See it anyway.</Review>
            <Review>The definitive Vietnam War documentary and arguably the greatest political documentary ever made.</Review>
            <Review>Quite simply, one of the greatest non-fiction films ever made.</Review>
            <Review>Hearts and Minds is an essay told in a voice of thinly controlled moral outrage, which sometimes dribbles over into seething hate.</Review>

        <Title>Test</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>89</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Set in the free-spirited San Francisco of 1985, Test lovingly portrays this exciting and harrowing era as young Frankie (dancer Scott Marlowe in a breakout acting debut) confronts the challenges of being an understudy in a modern dance company where he's taunted to "dance like a man!" Frankie embarks on a budding relationship with hunky Todd (Matthew Risch, HBO's "Looking"), a veteran dancer in the same company and the bad boy to Frankie's naivet�. As Frankie and Todd's friendship deepens, they navigate a world of risk - it's the early years of the epidemic - but also a world of hope, humor, visual beauty and musical relief. The captivating dance sequences were especially choreographed for the film by acclaimed U.S. choreographer Sidra Bell. The film's vibrant soundtrack includes work by '80s icons Jimmy Somerville (Bronski Beat), Klaus Nomi, Romeo Void, Laurie Anderson, Martha and the Muffins, Cocteau Twins and Sylvester.(C) Wolfe</StoryLine>

            <Review>Here is San Francisco as it was in its bohemian twilight, on the eve of catastrophe.</Review>
            <Review>"Test" is woefully inadequate and unnecessary when compared with "Parting Glances" (1986) and "Longtime Companion" (1989).</Review>
            <Review>Test is most effective when it prioritizes mood over psychological melodrama (which is often), but Johnson's approach is torn between Albert Camus and Brian De Palma.</Review>
            <Review>Six years after his debut feature, The New Twenty, writer-director Chris Mason Johnson returns with a film that's less polished but braver.</Review>
            <Review>If Test can portray a dark time with an underlying sense of hope for the future, it's because almost thirty years later, looking back at 1985, it has no ambivalence about the progress that's occurred since.</Review>
            <Review>This is a creative, ambitious project that delivers, thanks in no small part to a director who knows about dance - and to a cast that can both dance and act.</Review>
            <Review>Writer/director Chris Mason Johnson does an impressive job mounting the film as a drama and very gradually allowing tension and paranoia to permeate.</Review>
            <Review>An observant slice of life from a near-mythical time and place.</Review>
            <Review>A potent and sexy drama. The film's period soundtrack offers a great nostalgia fix.</Review>
            <Review>Adept as both timely character study and epochal drama, Test wonderfully manages fully formed humanism without sentimentality.</Review>
            <Review>An unsentimental but well-crafted look at San Francisco in 1985, during the early days of an epidemic that was just beginning to be understood.</Review>
            <Review>...not a whole hell of a lot happens in writer-director Chris Mason Johnson's Test, which looks particularly thin after the recent HBO debut of Larry Kramer's AIDS-themed The Normal Heart.</Review>

            <Review>As adept as the animation unit usually is at bringing the tone of the comics to the screen, at times this feels like a sitcom premise.</Review>
            <Review>Batman becomes not just a father figure to a young sidekick but in fact a father, trying to teach his arrogant and highly talented ninja assassin of a son a less fatal approach to combat and crimefighting.</Review>
            <Review>The worst from the DC library yet.</Review>
            <Review>Violent and noirish Batman is engaging but cynical.</Review>
            <Review>Neither terrific nor terrible, Son of Batman bears some similarities to a Saturday morning Batman cartoon; it's fast-paced, action-packed, entirely disposable and extremely fun at times.</Review>
            <Review>Serving more as a decent introduction to a new character to the Batman mythos than a fully developed adaptation of the Grant Morrison storyline, 'Son of Batman' is entertaining, but hardly essential viewing for DC animated movie fans.</Review>
            <Review>Son of Batman is not Batman and Son. It's a pig wrapped in a silk cape and cowl.</Review>
            <Review>Son of Batman has an engrossing take on the Dark Knight. Oftentimes, adding a kid to the mix is a sign of desperation, but in this case it allows for some further examination of the character.</Review>
            <Review>Son of Batman, the 20th DC Universe Animated Original Movie, makes considerable alterations to the original Grant Morrison comic book tale, but still delivers plenty of entertainment value for Bat-fans.</Review>
            <Review>With a title such as Son of Batman you'd be expecting some more kiddy-friendly material, but this latest made-for-DVD animated effort by Warner Home Video is simply too violent and bloody for younger viewers.</Review>

            <Review>The only reason to watch this picture is for the novelty value of feeling bad for Chris Klein and/or Teri Polo. To each his own, but my recommendation is "pass."</Review>
            <Review>"Authors Anonymous" proves too kindhearted to stick to its satirical guns; even the documentary conceit recedes when it becomes inconvenient.</Review>
            <Review>"Authors Anonymous" makes the same mistake it chides its characters for: hero worship.</Review>
            <Review>Pulling off a broad satire requires great finesse: If, as in the mockumentary "Authors Anonymous," all of the subjects are idiots, why should we care?</Review>
            <Review>Not even this movie's foolish characters could fail to notice the irony: there isn't a single moment of creativity in their own story.</Review>
            <Review>You get the sense that Kanner would benefit from attending a few workshops of her own.</Review>
            <Review>Each of the players comes across as a one-note stereotype with the same kind of behavior going on in practically every scene.</Review>
            <Review>Tiresome ensemble comedy pokes fun at publishing industry.</Review>
            <Review>...Authors Anonymous manages to be sweet-tempered mainly thanks to lead Kaley Cuoco.</Review>
            <Review>Stars Chris Klein and Kaley Cuoco, and is directed by a woman who was once the casting director for MVP: Most Valuable Primate.</Review>
            <Review>Some good performances and amusing insights are undone by a mockumentary format that doesn't fully support them. The stuff that works will ring a few bells for writers, though, and that may make it worth a conditional look.</Review>
            <Review>[...] Perhaps because the fake-doc construct has become so familiar [...] the bar for turning that approach into something fresh and genuinely funny is simply too high for this movie to clear.</Review>

            <Review>What could serve as a fascinating parallel between recent history and contemporary questions about the value of extraordinary rules of engagement in a time of omnipresent threats of terror, instead turns into a mawkish, inspirational lawyer movie...</Review>

            <Review>The movie is a wonderful surprise, cleverly written and executed brick by brick with a visual panache.</Review>
            <Review>Lord and Miller's sensibilities are continually clever, and The Lego Movie works hard to gradually deliver surprising payoffs to what seem to be throwaway bits.</Review>
            <Review>The Lego Movie has enough wit and wisdom to send a recession-age message to families on the importance of thinking through problems with creativity.</Review>
            <Review>As a rule, movies about toys need to be approached with extreme caution; some of them have been bad enough to count as health hazards. This one is the exception.</Review>
            <Review>This is truly a movie that children and their parents can both enjoy for different reasons.</Review>
            <Review>The Lego Movie: Merely a great film, or the greatest film ever in the history of cinema?</Review>
            <Review>The LEGO Movie teaches our kids what it means to be unique, imaginative, and heroically important by paving their own paths.</Review>
            <Review>An especially clever ontological construct is having all the various LEGO game-sets represent various dimensions of the LEGO cosmos, sort of like unitary paradises.</Review>
            <Review>The idea that the deadliest weapon in this Lego galaxy is glue, which will make everything permanent and unmovable, shows that childish wit is probably the purest wit of all.</Review>
            <Review>It's hard to imagine a more inspired Lego film, or one less concerned with selling toys.</Review>
            <Review>At least, lighthearted silliness serves as a palliative for the reflexive cynicism that emerges in viewers confronted with such a blatant corporate agenda. But the filmmakers do not have the good sense to stop there.</Review>
            <Review>Hilarious and heartfelt in the right ways, The Lego Movie also successfully pokes fun at the genre cliches we're all so used to.</Review>

            <Review>Even though the running time is short, the movie feels stretched out. Perhaps the curious subject matter would have been better served in, er, short form.</Review>
            <Review>One can't really fault Bekhor and Math for trying to entertain rather than educate viewers. But their carnival barker callousness is really disturbing ...</Review>
            <Review>The subject of an eccentric new documentary, the Icelandic Phallological Museum is devoted to preserving the male genitalia of mammals.</Review>
            <Review>A little slow and a whole heap surreal, "The Final Member" documents the search for that last specimen with a twinkle in its eye and warmth in its tone.</Review>
            <Review>[C]ould easily be nothing but snickers and mockery, but the directors offer a work filled with warmth, humor and humanism.</Review>
            <Review>The Final Member boasts a stranger-than-fiction subject so odd and funny it almost couldn't miss. But Bekhor and Math make the film much more than a limp gag.</Review>
            <Review>Each revelation is stranger and more fascinating than the next.</Review>
            <Review>One might expect this film to be nothing but R-rated silliness. Well, it's definitely R-rated, but it has a serious and even touching side.</Review>
            <Review>At 75 minutes, The Final Member is robust with entertainment, if somewhat short on length, which [proves] the old adage: it's not the size that matters, but how you use it.</Review>
            <Review>It has the relentless charm of a great cult film, and should be seen that way.</Review>
            <Review>The world's only penis museum is no joke, but there's plenty funny (and enlightening, and poignant) in this sweet portrait of a man dedicated to completing his life's work.</Review>
            <Review>Peculiar as the tale is, it never gets in the way of itself and The Final Member ultimately reflects on how we choose to live our life, and even more, how we want it to be remembered.</Review>

            <Review>"The Grand Budapest Hotel" is not his grandest work yet, but it is one worth an extended stay.</Review>
            <Review>The mannered, madcap proceedings are often delightful, occasionally silly, and here and there, gruesome and/or heartbreaking.</Review>
            <Review>I like Anderson when he's making movies about childhood -- "Rushmore," or "Fantastic Mr. Fox" -- but when he ventures into the realm of adulthood, he seems out of his jurisdiction.</Review>
            <Review>Grand isn't good enough a word for this Budapest Hotel. Great is more like it.</Review>
            <Review>Anderson's films are too precious for some, but for those of us willing to lose ourselves in them, they're a delight. "The Grand Budapest Hotel" is no different, except that he has added a hint of gravitas to the mix, improving the recipe.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is a flume ride through the imagination of one of the most creative minds making movies today, and the pleasure curls your toes. Also, be ready to crave some macaroons.</Review>
            <Review>There's a slightly darker edge to The Grand Budapest Hotel than Anderson's previous efforts.</Review>
            <Review>In The Grand Budapest Hotel we can sense both a progression and summarizing of the entire Wes Anderson canon.</Review>
            <Review>Just plain fun, full of the filmmaker's signature flourishes and curlicues, worked out with skill and finesse.</Review>
            <Review>Wes Anderson makes great kid movies. He had me at 'Moonrise Kingdom' and 'Fantastic Mr. Fox.' Grown-up movie-wise, Wes's weird world makes this reviewer weary.</Review>
            <Review>For anyone who has long suspected Wes Anderson of being a master technician in search of his heart, The Grand Budapest Hotel joyfully announces that the quest is over.</Review>
            <Review>Whimsical, frothy fun doesn't go down any easier than this, let alone with a performance as marvelous as Fiennes'.</Review>

            <Review>An unintended nightmare scenario for women in Hollywood, and the persistent humiliation required just to get noticed.</Review>
            <Review>There's not much else we can praise about it, but at least "Walk of Shame" is perfectly titled.</Review>
            <Review>A beautiful woman leaves a bar and goes home with James Marsden. And that is just about the only thing that makes sense in "Walk of Shame."</Review>
            <Review>Not even the fleet comic footwork of Elizabeth Banks can save this vile, unfunny stab at screwball farce.</Review>
            <Review>Though replete with plot holes and lapses in logic as wide and ugly as the L.A. Freeway, Walk of Shame doesn't have the moxie to go anywhere ludicrous or dangerous with its premise.</Review>
            <Review>The opening-credit montage featuring real-life news bloopers is funnier than anything in the script.</Review>
            <Review>Banks is one fierce talent more than able to carry a film all on her own, and here's hoping the next starring vehicle makes for a much smoother and consistent ride.</Review>
            <Review>...Walk Of Shame is a movie that asks you to not judge its main character by the cover that is her skimpy and short banana yellow Marc Jacobs dress, but the insubstantial contents...are so deficient, you're not given any reason to care either way.</Review>
            <Review>Raunchy one-night-stand comedy relies on stereotypes.</Review>
            <Review>It may be the second best "woman takes wild, wacky trip across Los Angeles" comedy to come out in the last decade, but it is still a pretty good, pretty funny movie.</Review>
            <Review>Despite Banks' swashbuckling performance, Walk of Shame is about as mediocre as they come.</Review>

            <Review>"The Machine" percolates with an elegantly palpable sense of wonder and danger.</Review>
            <Review>"The Machine" works modestly well, but still wobbles trying to balance its "thinking man's sci-fi" aspirations against the need to placate less adventurous fans via standard action content.</Review>
            <Review>The Machine brings little new to the subject save for an ominously ambiguous conclusion about the consequences of making computers more advanced than their human masters.</Review>
            <Review>A classy slice of cerebral sci-fi with a literary-cinematic heritage stretching back through Blade Runner and Metropolis to Frankenstein.</Review>
            <Review>Good British sci-fis don't come along very often, so this stylish slice of a dystopian near-future should be welcomed by fans.</Review>
            <Review>With many writers and directors keen to give a look at a future ravaged by impending war, it's a breath of fresh air when someone shows an evolutionary leap towards harmony.</Review>
            <Review>The film is ambitious visually, in spite of its small budget, and while not all of the effects come off, it's hard to hold that against an indie production like this.</Review>
            <Review>The first hour's setup of "The Machine" is better than the threadbare guns-blazing action payoff, but the exceptionally fine work of Caity Lotz commands attention.</Review>
            <Review>Some movies you find yourself liking despite of their mistakes, and this 2013 movie filmed in Wales is one of those movies.</Review>
            <Review>The Machine asks all the right questions yet does so without any heavy-handiness.</Review>
            <Review>The Machine is listening to the language of other science-fiction films-but [...] isn't up on the dialect, and hears only echoes of substance.</Review>
            <Review>Machine retains a dynamic presence, with interesting futureworld ideas sharply realized by writer/director Caradog W. James, who submits quite a cinematic vision for next to no production money.</Review>

            <Review>This intelligent movie becomes a gentle reproof of prejudice and ignorance, and I wish I could find some excitement in it.</Review>
            <Review>Honestly, it's hard to see why "Jimmy P." was ever made.</Review>
            <Review>Avoiding the usual therapy-drama story beats, Desplechin has made a densely satisfying drama about Freud, racism, and sympathy in its largest sense.</Review>
            <Review>A fascinating cross-cultural experiment that eventually runs itself into the ground.</Review>
            <Review>The movie offers the most psychologically complex screen portrait of a Native American character in at least twenty years, probably more.</Review>
            <Review>[A] ruminative, gentle and absorbing new film.</Review>
            <Review>It may not always treat psychology with the sophistication it deserves, but it at least acknowledges that it's an imperfect method of personal understanding.</Review>
            <Review>What grounds the film is the chemistry of the main performers.</Review>
            <Review>In warming quite a lot to Jimmy P, it's possible that I've gravitated to what Desplechin's long-term admirers might regard as the wrong film.</Review>
            <Review>The pain and sadness of Picard's life are perversely relegated to another time and place, one the film can only visit from the distance of his recollections. By the end, [Arnaud] Desplechin makes him known thoroughly, but not vividly.</Review>
            <Review>The fine lead performances by Benicio del Toro and Mathieu Amalric are the highlights of the artfully crafted, fact-based drama Jimmy P., which tries (sometimes in vain) to make psychotherapy cinematically intriguing.</Review>
            <Review>The sterile process that the film is fixated on is admirable, but Jimmy P. rarely gets at anything engrossing or interesting about its characters.</Review>

            <Review>The shifting tones keep the movie both buoyant and firmly grounded, and playing out in a sphere pitched somewhere between the mythic and the muddy.</Review>
            <Review>A tough rural drama by David Gordon Green that digs deep in all the right ways.</Review>
            <Review>It's young Sheridan's Gary who makes the film work, with his mix of earnest ambition, stubborn courage and hopeful endurance. He gives "Joe" the honesty it needs.</Review>
            <Review>A small-scale, expertly acted character study in which Cage plays an ex-con trying to make a quiet living in a backwater Texas town and trying, above all, to keep certain troublesome character tendencies in check.</Review>
            <Review>What happens along the way isn't particularly surprising to those familiar with Southern gothic sensibilities. But if the path is predictable, the acting is not.</Review>
            <Review>For Nicolas Cage, whose dumb, rant-for-hire projects have lately been making audiences forget how good he can be, Joe is more than a rescue - it's a re-birth.</Review>
            <Review>The burgeoning relationships may be clichéd in this type of story, but each resonates when gritty portrayals form them.</Review>
            <Review>The way director David Gordon Green uses Cage, and the way the actor modulates the performance, seems a quiet commentary on who he's become onscreen, and how to draw upon it.</Review>
            <Review>A real movie, for grown-ups, fighting for table scraps in a marketplace dominated by spider-men and x-persons.</Review>
            <Review>Nicolas Cage, in 2014, gave about 15 horrible performances and one great one</Review>
            <Review>For two hours, Cage's bad-thriller past doesn't catch up with him.</Review>
            <Review>A fantastic story of destiny finally calling for a drifter ( ... ) except that Gary Poulter was found dead two months after shooting wrapped, a victim of the alcoholic, hard-living, cancer-ridden existence he had somehow put behind him while on set.</Review>

            <Review>This project ... has clearly diverted too much of its small budget toward special effects.</Review>
            <Review>It's hard to see why IFC Films would attach themselves to this ho-hum scarefest.</Review>
            <Review>While the cast and crew's competence well exceed what anyone would expect from this breed of B movies, they cannot compensate for the flawed internal logic in the screenplay.</Review>
            <Review>Some of the voluminous attention paid to details ... should have been spent on good old-fashioned shivers.</Review>
            <Review>or Almost Human, writer/director Joe Begos does a brilliant job of blending together the alien abduction and slasher subgenres all while hearkening back to many genre fans favorite era of horror films- the 1980's.</Review>
            <Review>Be sure to stay through the closing credits for a tag--not that it's worth it, but I was the only one at my screening who did, and misery loves company.</Review>
            <Review>A pretty eerie and tense, albeit flawed, horror entry.</Review>
            <Review>Character motivation, cleverness and intelligence don't factor into Almost Human, a gory genre homage that could have been an underground terror treat, instead of a "Cult Movies' Greatest Hits."</Review>
            <Review>It's a bit rough round the edges but just wait for Begos to get his hands on some real money and we can expect something very special indeed.</Review>
            <Review>Begos' film drips and oozes with straight-to-video nostalgia</Review>
            <Review>What's the point of mankind's victory if it's the victors themselves that are--as in just barely--almost human?</Review>
            <Review>While Almost Human pays homage to some truly great horror and sci-fi films of the past, it fails to really personify its own identity and it crumbles under the weight of paying too much homage without building its own foundation.</Review>

            <Review>Ernest learns to share, Celestine learns to a paint - and the audience learns that in a Disney-dominated marketplace, kids are still free to choose their own mini mouse.</Review>
            <Review>The unlikely cross-species friendship of Celestine the mouse and Ernest the bear teaches a gentle lesson about irrational intolerance in this French animated charmer.</Review>
            <Review>"Ernest &amp; Celestine" draws on plenty of classics, animated and otherwise, for inspiration, but the film manages to be delightful on its own offbeat terms.</Review>
            <Review>Ernest &amp; Celestine is a genuine charmer for kids, and for the parental units tagging alongside.</Review>
            <Review>A sweet-natured tale of an unlikely friendship between a burly bear and a plucky mouse. It's also decidedly offbeat with an emphasis on animal dentistry.</Review>
            <Review>A joyous rediscovery of hand-drawn animation, all witty and expressive lines, spare backgrounds and gorgeous, watery hues.</Review>
            <Review>A curious blend of charm and tooth-obsessed strangeness, with a wholesome message about friendship that's somewhat tainted by the characters' Butch and Sundance antics, but illustrated in a gentle style with wonderfully subtle-yet-vibrant music.</Review>
            <Review>A welcomed alternative to chaotic kid-centric blockbusters, channelling the spirit of humble animated greats My Neighbour Totoro and The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.</Review>
            <Review>Encompassing the powerful elements of honesty, truth, and acceptance, Pennac's screenplay, once again, fixates on the small details that bring our story full circle and unimaginably to life.</Review>
            <Review>Beautiful Belgian animated film; the storybook simplicity of the hand-drawn animation has an allure and clarity that reinforces [how] new technology does not render traditional forms of animation inferior or obsolete.</Review>
            <Review>From its opening credits, [it] proclaims its hand-drawn, delicate, watercolour aesthetic. But it's not all sweetness and light: there's a dark strand of humour and some sly visual gags in this clever tale of opposites.</Review>
            <Review>Two styles combine to create a world at once impressionistic and lived in, infused with the kind of warm glow which emanates from a cosy fireplace.</Review>

            <Review>What separates this film from others of its type is the highly specialized manner in which writer-director Sebastien Betbeder has elected to recount the lives and loves of a group of young Parisians ...</Review>
            <Review>The movie reminds you with a series of gentle nudges that whether you want it to or not, the future happens.</Review>
            <Review>The film strongly evokes the spirit and playfulness of the Nouvelle Vague ...</Review>
            <Review>In general, imagine some classic Woody Allen devices, but amped up to the point where they dominate the movie rather than providing intermittent stylized distance.</Review>
            <Review>An innovative and engrossing French romantic comedy.</Review>
            <Review>Betbeder joins the ever-lengthening lineage of the New Wave but his portrayal is thoroughly contemporary, with an appealing open-mindness and nimble sense of humor and sensitivity appreciable on its own terms.</Review>
            <Review>There's nothing even remotely new about this self-conscious little indie, one in which the seeds of dramatic sincerity are smothered by constant affectation.</Review>
            <Review>A determined lack of formality gives the film its sense of immediacy and edginess, though this is largely wasted as spontaneity is largely absent.</Review>
            <Review>Betbeder's tale of aging Parisian art-school grads falling in love is told as a near-relentless collage of fourth-wall-breaking monologues -- "High Fidelity"-style -- and peppered with chapter breaks, dream sequences, and clips from other movies.</Review>

            <Review>13 Sins is a smart, stylish picture elevated by fine performances by Webber and a superior ensemble of supporting players, including Richard Bower, Ron Perlman, and Pruitt Taylor Vince.</Review>
            <Review>An empty, efficient thriller that leaves you as cold as most of its characters.</Review>
            <Review>Never satisfyingly accounts for how the unseen puppeteer manages to keep a constant eye on Elliot's every move.</Review>
            <Review>The "Saw" formula of a mysterious voice guiding our hero through a series of depravities has gone a bit stale.</Review>
            <Review>Stamm brings such a deft touch to these tonal transitions that it's hard to believe he directed the dreadful 2010 hit The Last Exorcism.</Review>
            <Review>A balance of ragged social anger and nervous, pulpy thrills.</Review>
            <Review>Darkly comic and occasionally very gory.</Review>

            <Review>Not surprisingly, the last challenge is the most difficult of all.</Review>
            <Review>Flimsy plot withstanding, 13 Sins is an enjoyable watch and fits neatly into the ever expanding genre of film as theme park ride: thrilling, shocking, forgettable.</Review>

        <StoryLine>A British mercenary scours L.A. for his missing daughter with the help of a seasoned inner-city detective in this gritty action thriller. Lex Walker (Craig Fairbrass) is fighting on the front lines in Afghanistan when he is summoned to L.A. to identify his daughter Sam's remains. When the sheet at the morgue is pulled back, however, Lex is alternately shocked and relieved to see that it is not his little girl laid out on the slab. Yet the question remains - if this isn't his daughter, where has she gone? Convinced that his time to save Sam is quickly running out, Walker talks a local detective (Jason Patrick) into following the trail of clues straight to the wealthy internet entrepreneur (James Caan) who previously employed her. Later, with thugs and assassins closing in from all sides, Walker realizes that the only way to save his daughter is to use the skills he learned in Afghanistan on the mean streets of L.A. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>"The Outsider" is a subpar version of "The Limey" starring a subpar version of Terence Stamp.</Review>
            <Review>Given a lot of style, this could have been another "The Limey"; given even a bit more humor and flashier action sequences, it might have passed for another Statham picture.</Review>
            <Review>There's not enough here for even an imported action hero to work with.</Review>
            <Review>The Outsider doesn't break the action movie mold in any way but it is an efficient little, low-budget crime thriller that has the good sense to not overstay its welcome.</Review>
            <Review>Fairbrass moves stiffly through both the drama and fight scenes - as if he were underwater. Supporting parts in Jason Statham movies may be his calling, instead.</Review>
            <Review>Blunt and simplistic, there's not a moment in this thriller that feels inspired by anything other than criminal TV shows.</Review>
            <Review>Embraces its disposable B-movie leanings, but remains mediocre even under these modest prospects.</Review>
            <Review>This isn't Taken, unless that's how you feel after forking over $10 bucks to see this thing.</Review>
            <Review>Sadly, [a certain] baseline competence elevates The Outsider, just barely, into the realm of perfect forgetability.</Review>

            <Review>Butt is a decent word-spinner and self-deprecating funny man, but the decision to have the rest of the cast play it straight is a mistake; it's as if he plugged his performance into a weak Law and Order episode.</Review>
            <Review>Brent Butt's Corner Gas brand of humour has plenty of loyal fans and if you enjoy his wry and self-effacing shtick, you'll find No Clue to be an inconsequential but pleasant diversion.</Review>
            <Review>Although it's a relatively low-budget indie flick, I'd rate "No Clue" among my top three film noir/P.I. spoofs-right up there with "The Cheap Detective" (1978) and "Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid" (1982).</Review>
            <Review>Butt is, it becomes increasingly clear, simply not funny in the slightest...</Review>
            <Review>If [Butt] could make the serious bits feel bigger, as opposed to just windrow dressing to his jokes, he'd have a parody worth really taking seriously.</Review>

            <Review>With only 74 slowly unfolding shots, it's closer to gallery installation than conventional cinema, but for audiences open to the experience, it's inexplicably compelling.</Review>
            <Review>Non-narrative films can be opaque in deep ways. Visitors slips into pseudo-profundity. That said, I'd see it again.</Review>
            <Review>We get the point, and have gotten it since 1982. And aestheticizing it in this way doesn't make the message any more convincing or urgent.</Review>
            <Review>The "oh, come off it" art movie of 2014.</Review>
            <Review>Reggio has talked about his movies as attempts to bypass the intellect, a "visceral form of cinema" that's "aimed at your solar plexus." But you may experience "Visitors" as more of a sedative than a punch in the guts.</Review>
            <Review>"Visitors" restores a sense of monumentality to a medium that has seemed so diminished by recent technological and commercial imperatives ...</Review>
            <Review>While that unknowing used to invigorate me to scour resources and get to the heart of the art itself, I now merely shrug as I move on to the next new thing.</Review>
            <Review>This is a slow moving film, but it does have a few abrupt cuts. There are some striking images in this film. This is mainly for contemplative people who have patience, and for fans of Godfrey Reggio's films.</Review>
            <Review>Entrancing, reminding of a thought-provoking media art exhibit exemplifying the antithesis of Hollywood moviemaking.</Review>
            <Review>Visitors will work for some but fall short for many, it is an experiment in filmmaking that attempts something new but ultimately fails.</Review>
            <Review>Staring at "Visitors," not only do many things seem unusual, many more seem familiar, paralleled by other artists.</Review>
            <Review>The score, by Philip Glass, adds to the off-kilter mood and the faces of a serene gorilla, and a moody child in a playground, prove especially absorbing.</Review>

            <Review>More horror remakes should be as thoughtful as "Patrick: Evil Awakens," an atypically clever riff on the 1978 Australian thriller "Patrick."</Review>
            <Review>This well-crafted remake of 1978's 'Patrick' is rich in gothic trappings and features a terrific central performance by Sharni Vinson.</Review>
            <Review>It's a techno-thriller of brain-dead proportions ...</Review>
            <Review>This Ozploitation remake is a spookily effective fright-fest.</Review>
            <Review>Patrick: Evil Awakens is an entirely forgettable horror flick that lets the great talent involved go to waste. There are certainly more entertaining low-budget horror offerings that you can waste an evening on.</Review>
            <Review>[Patrick] is malevolent, but he's also melancholy-the ultimate example of a guy who likes a girl, but try as he might, can't make a move.</Review>
            <Review>Against all odds, they've managed to succeed where many efforts fail, returning the tension and peculiarity of the premise for another go-around of telekinetic terror.</Review>
            <Review>"Patrick" isn't one for necessarily spinning its wheels, but it too often hurts itself by jumping the rails into insanity.</Review>
            <Review>The newly capitalised PATRICK is as spookily Gothic and look-out-behind-you! crazy as the original.</Review>
            <Review>reimagined from Richard Franklin's 1978 original as a piece of hysterical high gothic with giallo-esque trimmings (not least the fabulously over-the-top score by Pino Donaggio).</Review>
            <Review>Hartley's remake is extremely faithful to the original, and what is most fun about it is the style and tone ... Donaggio's bold, over-the-top, old-school horror score reminds us that we are in an homage, and to enjoy the ride as such.</Review>
            <Review>Effectively chilly, moody remake of Richard Franklin's 1978 horror classic about a mysterious coma patient, smartly updated for iGen audiences...A skilfully made genre piece, a very satisfying movie meal, well done with a garnish of dark humour.</Review>

            <Review>While this road movie may not have great originality or huge box-office potential, it's a low-key charmer with a large-souled performance at its center.</Review>
            <Review>The script (by director Gary Lundgren with James Twyman) is modestly feel-good to a fault and the scenery expectedly beautiful, but it's the unforced acting providing the most nourishment.</Review>
            <Review>Solid acting overcomes a lack of dynamic tension in this family-friendly film.</Review>
            <Review>It is, among other things, a sharp distaff rejoinder to the male-centered, sour-faced "Nebraska."</Review>
            <Review>Not without its charms, but do elderly filmgoers really need their entertainment this watered down?</Review>
            <Review>worth the trip to appreciate the acting</Review>
            <Review>Shirley Knight gives a winning lead performance, and the film captures the beauty of Southern Oregon landscapes.</Review>
            <Review>Knight shines in this contemplative, unrushed road movie on foot, with a rare, respectful focus on the existential despair of an older woman. And a solitary journey that is a female take on voyaging through those woods that are lovely, dark and deep.</Review>
            <Review>A marginal showcase for fans of the twice Oscar-nominated Shirley Knight that falters by taking the road more frequently traveled.</Review>
            <Review>A road-trip movie that takes its time, with an enjoyable ramble through the beautiful woods of southern Oregon, 'Redwood Highway' is a character study of a determined, if sometimes perplexed, woman.</Review>

        <StoryLine>On January 18, 2003, police, alerted by a frantic 911 call from a distraught pair of teenage girls, arrived at the girls Toronto area townhouse to find their mother dead. It appeared the 44-year-old alcoholic, having slipped into a booze-and-pill stupor, drowned in her own bathwater. The death was ruled accidental by the authorities. In the months that followed, however, police were alerted to rumours and reports that the teenagers had been gossiping to friends about the accident. Police began piecing together rumours that suggested the teens might have had a hand in their mother's death. In fact, rather than an accident, the story that emerged portrayed the two teens as cold-blooded, premeditated killers. (C) Official Facebook</StoryLine>

            <Review>The film owes whatever persuasiveness it has to the teen leads' sharp performances - their sisterly chemistry and their filial friction with an alcohol-addled mother, well played by Mira Sorvino.</Review>
            <Review>Ms. Breslin and especially Ms. Henley are quite good, elevating a film that seems like an oft-told tale.</Review>
            <Review>This kind of thing requires a velvet touch, though director Stanley M. Brooks hits only hammer-heavy notes.</Review>
            <Review>Any potential for an in-depth examination of the adolescent psyche pushed to its limits goes unmet, though not for lack of trying.</Review>

            <Review>What should have been suspenseful, even terrifying, is tiresome thanks to mostly predictable treatment.</Review>
            <Review>Brooks crafts a glorified basic cable movie, complete with stiff staging, obvious performances, and clunky screenwriting that turns absolute horror into unintentional comedy.</Review>

            <Review>The filmmaking is playful without feeling jokey, the narrative stuffed with fun complications.</Review>
            <Review>Neeson, who brings enormous conviction to these late-career action roles, moves his big body through confined spaces ... with so much power that you expect him to rip out the seats.</Review>
            <Review>Anyone planning to see Non-Stop should probably just go see it. This is one of those near-perfect, peeled-onion, airplane-hijacking thrillers in which each removed layer brings you closer to a single, happy tear.</Review>
            <Review>Why demand logic of an action movie released in February, when audiences just want a nice, bumpy ride?</Review>
            <Review>It's all fairly entertaining and eminently disposable.</Review>
            <Review>The problem is that Non-Stop tries to be something it's not. It has one too many scenes that border on ludicrous, and the big reveal barely makes sense.</Review>
            <Review>Absurd 'thriller' skimps on thrills.</Review>
            <Review>The screening audience was apparently just as dumb as this reviewer, because when 'Non-Stop' stopped at its ridiculous CGI deus ex machina finale-everyone cheered and clapped.</Review>
            <Review>"Non-Stop" sees Liam Neeson resume his generic action hero persona - as seen in "Taken" and "Unknown" - to far less successful results.</Review>
            <Review>After the entertaining thriller Unknown, Neeson reteams with Collet-Serra for what is not only the Orphan helmer's best work, but also a pretty good film in its own right.</Review>
            <Review>With Non-Stop, Collet-Serra confirms his status of one of Hollywood's most inventive genre artists (and one of the last to shoot on film).</Review>
            <Review>Non-Stop still offers a decent ride. Just be ready to shrug off a few cringe-worthy moments.</Review>

            <Review>"Alan Partridge" could have been an expansion of Coogan's original character concept into the international big time. Thankfully, it's not.</Review>
            <Review>The movie clips along and pleases its fan base, and it'll amuse a lot of Partridge newbies as well.</Review>
            <Review>Recommended without hesitation.</Review>
            <Review>Coogan is an old hand at the comedy of fear, envy, and bruised egotism, and the movie is packed with clever gags.</Review>
            <Review>The way Alan feels on the outside is the way a lot of people feel at their most vulnerable. And so we watch him and recognize him, and then cringe and wish him luck.</Review>
            <Review>After making a crackling good impression, Alan Partridge overstays its welcome to a harrowing extent.</Review>
            <Review>The creaky premise of the plot is behind the times by decades, not years.</Review>
            <Review>Steve Coogan, Colm Meaney and the rest of the cast are very good. The plot has enough interesting twists in it to keep the hostage situation from getting stale.</Review>
            <Review>It's Coogan's brassy performance that makes this English comedy rock.</Review>
            <Review>Coogan walks that delicate line between being a character you love and a character you love to hate.</Review>
            <Review>As a film, Alan Partridge is too aimless and low on laughs to be worth the 90 minutes.</Review>
            <Review>Doesn't hit every target or land every joke, but Steve Coogan's enthusiasm for the roleand the project as a wholeproves infectious.</Review>

            <Review>"Shadow Recruit" is fun in a minor, winter-season way.</Review>
            <Review>I'm aware that commercial and cultural forces require everything to be rebooted triennially with fresher, hotter stars. But this is the second time the Jack Ryan franchise has rejected a youth transplant.</Review>
            <Review>The dim star wattage in this fifth rehash is palpable from the start.</Review>
            <Review>This is the very definition of an OK thriller.</Review>
            <Review>Director Kenneth Branagh knows how to invest the ridiculous with a sort of grandeur - Exhibit A: the surprisingly fun Thor - but Shadow Recruit is more straightforward in nature, so he can't get too fancy.</Review>
            <Review>A pretty suspenseful, largely engaging, and hardly ever too-over-the-top spy thriller.</Review>
            <Review>As an action-thriller, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit is more or less competent. As an heir to the Jack Ryan mantle, however, it is less so.</Review>
            <Review>Focal compositions and moody editing in the vein of Hitchcock help establish suspense and emotion without the need for excessive special effects or big-budget set pieces.</Review>
            <Review>(Director) Branagh doesn't reinvent the wheel here, but he does take the rims off a flashy 2014 Tesla and put them on a 1985 Camaro: a big, comfy muscle car asking only that you point it in the right direction and step on the gas.</Review>
            <Review>A dull, vacant post-Cold War spy yarn that has nothing to say about anything.</Review>
            <Review>The vulnerability of the Jack Ryan character is still present, something very important that keeps us rooting for him.</Review>
            <Review>Pine deserves another shot at a stronger more daring Jack Ryan film...</Review>

            <Review>An act of personal and cultural recovery, an exorcism of evil through art and a 'never forget' memoir of survival that reminds us that the past century has been a parade of holocaust.</Review>

            <Review>The movie is not much of an argument to begin with, since there's very little science yet that can give us answers to Brown's or anybody's hand-wringing.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate/>
        <Duration>101</Duration>
        <StoryLine>An Old West outlaw is torn between redemption and revenge after a botched robbery leads him into the lives of a compassionate widow and her young children in this Christian western. Henry Myers (Drew Waters) was the kind of desperado who wouldn't think twice about committing robbery to put food on the table. But Henry's partners are a treacherous bunch, and betray him in the wake of a bank heist gone awry. Left for dead in the scorching desert, Henry later awakens in the home of a kindly widow who nurses him back to health. Just as Henry finds faith and begins to build a new life, however, his old partners learn that he's still standing in his boots, and return to finish him off. Now, with a gun in one hand and a Bible in the other, this repentant outlaw must choose between the word of God, and the law of the land.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Takes a long time to tell us nothing we didn't know ... A missed opportunity.</Review>
            <Review>Comes across as a cinematic, slightly dramatized Cliffs Notes edition a story that's been told often.</Review>
            <Review>It's not a bad film, exactly, but it's a jumbled, uncertain one, and it never quite makes a compelling case for itself.</Review>
            <Review>There are too many major characters and too many points of emphasis. As elegantly directed as it sometimes is, it feels disjointed, scattered.</Review>
            <Review>A rather dull docudrama that doesn't have a strong reason to exist, outside of perhaps a financial one.</Review>
            <Review>An exhaustively researched - and, quite frankly, very exhausting - adaptation of journalist Mara Leveritt's book.</Review>
            <Review>Devil's Knot is a fine film, but those searching for Egoyan's signature touches (which would seem apparent) will be left wanting more.</Review>
            <Review>Sound and look are key to atmosphere of ominous inevitability of conviction. . .Admirable for using only local points-of-view. ..Worth seeking out for thoughtful perspective.</Review>
            <Review>If anything positive can be gained from Devil's Knot, it's that hopefully it will lead new viewers to the magnificent experiences that await them by watching the superior Paradise Lost trilogy and the conclusive West of Memphis</Review>
            <Review>It doesn't quite gel as either a proper whodunnit, an insight into a killer's mind, a debate about lyrics in heavy metal music or a gripping legal case.</Review>
            <Review>In its way, this is the most terrifying horror movie I've seen in a long time; the woods where the kids die are like something out of Evil Dead. I was left angry and wrung out.</Review>
            <Review>This blandly made dramastisation by Atom Egoyan is an extremely average courtroom piece that, despite strong work by Reece Witherspoon and Colin Firth, feels like a 1970s telemovie.</Review>

            <Review>"Tim's Vermeer" is about many things - art history, technology, painting technique, beauty - but ultimately it's a beguiling study of fascination.</Review>
            <Review>We should never forget that Penn and Teller are professional bamboozlers, and their attempt to re-frame the definition of genius might be nothing but smoke and mirrors.</Review>
            <Review>Unexpectedly dazzling.</Review>
            <Review>Tim's Vermeer is film as forensics, bringing math and science to bear to solve an art-world mystery.</Review>
            <Review>"Tim's Vermeer" is a movie for people who like to think, who like to ponder the big questions surrounding art and the act of creation.</Review>
            <Review>Mostly it is fascinating and compelling.</Review>
            <Review>Tim's Vermeer refers not just to the replica Vermeer he seeks to paint, but to his understanding of who Vermeer was and how he accomplished his work.</Review>
            <Review>Perhaps the ultimate take-away from Tim's Vermeer is the unquenchable curiosity of certain people, albeit those with the money to finance that inquisitiveness, to get to the bottom of history's mysteries. In that respect, Jenison is an artist.</Review>
            <Review>The lengths to which Jenison goes to ensure he is working with the same tools, limitations and liberties that were available to Vermeer are nothing short of gobsmacking.</Review>
            <Review>What it turns out to actually be about is Tim Jenison, and what it means to be a member of the new (techno) rich in the United States of the 21st Century.</Review>
            <Review>Tim's Vermeer is both enjoyable as entertainment and as an intelligently mounted case study of how art and technology complement, rather than grind against, each other. As Penn eloquently puts it: "The problem is we make that distinction."</Review>
            <Review>A lively, intriguing look at the line between artist and inventor, one that challenges the very notion that the distinction should be made at all.</Review>

        <Duration>114</Duration>
        <StoryLine>From legendary Academy Award (R)-winning writer/director Costa-Gavras (Missing, Z) comes CAPITAL, a fast-paced, darkly comic, suspenseful drama set in the high stakes world of global finance. When the CEO of France's Phenix Bank collapses on the golf course, Machiavellian young executive Marc Tourneuil (Gad Elmaleh, "Midnight in Paris") is crowned as his replacement. A whirlwind of ruthless ambition, power struggles, greed and deception ensues as Tourneuil's brutal ascent is jeopardized by a hostile takeover attempt from a large American hedge fund led by Dittmar Rigule (Gabriel Byrne, "Vikings," "In Treatment"), erotic distractions from international supermodel Nassim (Liya Kebede), and adversaries with an agenda for destruction. CAPITAL is a pointed commentary on how the Darwinian world of contemporary capitalism plays itself out across the global financial stage. (c) Cohen</StoryLine>

            <Review>Director Costa-Gavras takes a vaguely facetious tone toward the evils of global finance, which he concludes is a game for gluttonous boys.</Review>
            <Review>It's a bit like what The Godfather would have been if it had been set in "The Bank of Evil" from Despicable Me -- and if its antihero were a cipher instead of Michael Corleone.</Review>
            <Review>What's lacking is most surprising from this dissident filmmaker: the emotional outrage.</Review>
            <Review>The famously left-leaning Costa-Gavras is preaching to the choir in his indignation, but he does so in slick, brisk fashion.</Review>
            <Review>In the end, "Capital" is just a dark comic sketch of bald-faced greed, with little nuance or real feeling.</Review>
            <Review>"Capital" is too cynical to ever really suggest that redemption is possible. Not that anyone watching will even care.</Review>
            <Review>A fast-paced, cynical piece of entertainment that serves as a surprisingly simple criticism of our uneven system of dollars and cents.</Review>
            <Review>Costa-Gavras certainly found an intriguing leading man in Elmaleh, with his ice-cold stare that may remind audiences of Steve McQueen at his most penetrating.</Review>
            <Review>"Capital" isn't as good as "Margin Call" or "Arbitrage," in part because Costa-Gavras holds these characters in such contempt rather than trying to understand what motivates their insatiable greed.</Review>
            <Review>It's about a callous bunch of high stakes financial market players who are out to rob the poor to give to the rich.</Review>
            <Review>"Capital" gives an intriguing look into the high-level workings of corporate Europe through the eyes of Tourneuil in an effective character study.</Review>
            <Review>Capital's chief pleasure is also a huge limitation: in all its merciless hubris, it's smartly, stylishly blank.</Review>

In its course, the eight stories entwine to form a fascinating and often funny portrait of a group of very young athletes and their families, in which the narrow-focused, peculiar and highly competitive junior golf subculture becomes both a window into contemporary global society and an inspiring reflection of the human condition.

            <Review>Adult World does have some smart, funny and wincingly painful things to say about the desire to make art vs. the desire to be famous for it.</Review>
            <Review>Roberts is completely over-the-top here, her frantic, unfunny performance serving only to highlight Cusack's caginess and restraint.</Review>
            <Review>"Adult World" is a coming-of-age story in which the starting age seems to be approximately 9. As a result, it just doesn't work.</Review>
            <Review>It's packed with independent-film cliches, yet director Scott Coffey manages to rise above them, thanks largely to the performances of Emma Roberts and John Cusack.</Review>
            <Review>Never quite fully delivers much more than yet another oh-poor-me take on post-collegiate struggles in the cold, cruel 21st Century.</Review>
            <Review>A smart, incisive comedy about a recent college grad's booby-trapped immersion into real life.</Review>
            <Review>There is potentially a good movie bubbling under the surface in the interaction between Amy and Rat and especially in the hinted-at desperation of her struggle to make a success of her life, but this is overtaken by the tedious melodramatic whining.</Review>
            <Review>Cusack is fabulously droll as the reluctant mentor, while Armando Riesco delivers a touchingly off-kilter performance as the drag queen who also provides the heroine with lessons in life.</Review>
            <Review>Completely stealing the show and delivering my favorite supporting turn of the year so far is Armando Riesco.</Review>
            <Review>Adult World goes all kinds of satisfying places and the lowercase niceties begin with knowing how to use Emma Roberts' eyes, and their bright, darting gaze, which can flick from irritation to consternation to fury just like one-two-three.</Review>
            <Review>It is genuinely funny and surprisingly touching by the end, which is more than can be said for most of Hollywood's efforts of late.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is rated R, yet sensitive 12-year-old girls and the boys scared to talk to them probably represent the ideal audience for this wan coming-of-age sitcom in feature-film drag.</Review>

            <Review>This gripping Palestinian thriller evokes Gillo Pontecorvo's The Battle of Algiers in its depiction of not only the psychological pressures faced by people under occupation, but the murky moral consequences of retaliating.</Review>
            <Review>It's told with a stark, pitiless clarity that leaves you with fewer answers than before.</Review>
            <Review>Omar is romance and thriller. Of course, trust is at the heart of the matter.</Review>
            <Review>A fraught film ...</Review>
            <Review>Abu-Assad offers no solutions here. Instead he paints a portrait of the daily rhythms of the occupation, an endless conflict that has seeped into every aspect of life in the West Bank.</Review>
            <Review>The film works best as a straightforward melodrama set in an anything but straightforward world.</Review>
            <Review>Omar is an obvious political thriller which consistently, insistently attempts to steer us in a particular direction.</Review>
            <Review>Beautifully shot, complicated, smart, and undeniably intense ... well-deserving of its place as the Palestinian nominee for this year's Best Foreign Language Film.</Review>
            <Review>Doesn't provide easy answers as it builds its pressure cooker environment, putting primary attention on the personalities involved, allowing for a human perspective as it details acts of breathless survival and suffocating paranoia.</Review>
            <Review>From button-pushing Palestinian writer/director Hany Abu-Assad, who gave us the inflammatory Paradise Now in 2005, comes an equally piercing, if less politically strident look at life under Israeli occupation.</Review>
            <Review>Bakri gives a richly detailed performance, often allowing his stoicism to slip and reveal the confused and angry young man within.</Review>
            <Review>Abu-Assad does not aim for the Dardennes' breathless immediacy. Rather, the story is laid out in a lucid, diagrammatic way, like a mathematical proof that for someone in Omar's position there are no right choices.</Review>

        <StoryLine>A family of five moves into a beautiful, sprawling dream home. One problem: it's cursed, having caused the deaths of the previous family to occupy it, leaving only one survivor (Jacki Weaver). The family's moody 18-year-old son and his mysterious new neighbor inadvertently awaken something in the house while also violently shaking the many skeletons in the many closets. Mac Carter's debut feature is a frightening and powerful character-driven haunted-house film that isn't afraid to take the action outside. (c) IFC</StoryLine>

            <Review>Making a virtue of unoriginality, this clammy little ghost story, confidently directed by Mac Carter, conjures a whole heap of atmosphere from little more than clever camera angles and bedsheet apparitions.</Review>
            <Review>By the time the final act unleashes its revelations and peril, "Haunt" has felt more like an exercise in formal spookiness than a full-blooded story of lingering malevolence.</Review>
            <Review>There's lots of mixed film stock and screeches on the soundtrack (as in the credits for "Seven"), but this gets annoying, as do the predictable twists.</Review>
            <Review>There is virtually nothing in Mac Carter's horror flick that deviates from the standard haunted house plot (or, in this case, plod).</Review>
            <Review>I've had bigger scares from the windows at FAO Schwarz.</Review>
            <Review>The frustration here comes from the filmmakers' inability to present characters with dimension, so that we might come to identify with them and their fears.</Review>
            <Review>While it may not necessarily give horror fans a case of the heebie jeebies any time soon, it's just nice to see a moderate supernatural thriller actually put forth some effort and not just give us another paint-by-numbers spookfest</Review>
            <Review>Brutal and violent, it becomes obvious in hindsight how much this film needed less replication and a bit more bite.</Review>
            <Review>Given a better script -- or at least, one that was a little more self-aware -- Haunt could have been a solid scare.</Review>
            <Review>A respectably old-school chiller that feels sort of refreshing, even if it doesn't leave much of an impression.</Review>
            <Review>a nice little slumber party thriller to watch with the lights off</Review>
            <Review>A humdrum, even irritating slog that, safe to say, won't be giving anyone a sleepless night.</Review>

            <Review>Surveying the peculiar array of 1980s retreads clustered into release this week, I'm reminded of Marty McFly in Back to the Future Part II, traveling forward in time 30 years to discover that everything is still the same, only worse.</Review>
            <Review>Padilha is Brazilian, and it's interesting that both RoboCops have been made by men whose non-Hollywood work focused on their respective countries' curdled politics.</Review>
            <Review>This Robo-reboot tries fiercely to update the satirical punch and stylistic perversity Paul Verhoeven's 1987 original. It's a futile gesture.</Review>
            <Review>Cynical, boring, PG-13 retread.</Review>
            <Review>Neither Alex Murphy's internal moral conflict nor the larger, vaguely satiric portrait of a global culture dependent on high-tech law enforcement seem to be the main point of this Robocop remake, which raises the question of what is meant to be the point.</Review>
            <Review>It's well made, polished, and hits every mark - but is it crazy to want a futuristic sci-fi action flick about a motorcycle-riding metal supercop to be just a little more fun?</Review>
            <Review>The new Robocop is a generic shoot-em-up for much of the film, one no different than any other.</Review>
            <Review>this RoboCop gives a mostly sensible Friday night action outing, laced with modest character development and provoking a little thought here or there.</Review>
            <Review>What is Robocop? He's a quadriplegic Ironman without the rocket-booster. And both Robocop and Ironman are basically Terminators. Robocop 2.0 has better armor, but less fun.</Review>
            <Review>Despite straying from the satiric bent of the original, this edition has plenty to say - and plenty of ways to thrill its audience.</Review>
            <Review>Most older viewers will probably feel that RoboCop cannot match Verhoeven's satirical originality, but the computer age has made the core ethos more relevant to contemporary society.</Review>
            <Review>It's not a problem that they went and remade Robocop. But the biggest problem with this Robocop is that it's a remake.</Review>

The is the first ever 'doc opera' - a dizzying blend of documentary archive footage, animation and rock opera that will cement forever the legend of Alice Cooper.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Alan Polsky and Gabriel Polsky propel the material in a way that can feel over-determined. But they grasp the eccentricities and desperation of fringe dwellers, and at its strongest their atmospheric film has the pull of a sad outlaw song.</Review>
            <Review>We have seen many films about losers on the run, but in the directorial debut of former Chicago siblings Alan and Gabe Polsky, we get an intriguing new take on brotherly love not only gone wrong, but clearly hopeless from the beginning.</Review>
            <Review>This independent drama effectively captures the spirit of much contemporary fiction: the tone is at once precious and stark, and the narrative drifts from one episode to another (and from realism to fantasy) as though it were playing out in a dream.</Review>
            <Review>As good as "The Motel Life" is for the actors, that's how bad it is for the viewer.</Review>
            <Review>It's occasionally pretentious but ultimately moving, at least for the miniscule audience that will turn out to see such a downer of a movie.</Review>
            <Review>A pedestrian, undeveloped indie clunker, its failure as a complete, satisfying story especially disappointing since the sibling relationship at its center could have been special with a better script.</Review>
            <Review>Watching The Motel Life, I felt that I was in the hands of someone capable of making a great film.</Review>
            <Review>There's definitely a niche audience out there that will love The Motel Life; and this is a film that deserves to be loved.</Review>
            <Review>The whole thing is deep-down conservative and wetter than a Labrador's kiss.</Review>
            <Review>The rambling plot may resemble a lyric from a mawkish country song but the film-makers bring an engaging mix of tenderness and grit to the downbeat material.</Review>
            <Review>The film is heavy-going, unformed and self-indulgent, with characters who are neither sympathetic nor (crucially) interesting.</Review>

        <StoryLine>As cliches go, in 1999 the World as we knew it was about to change - and we'd been expecting it. Since childhood we'd been promised that the 21st century would bring us dramatic new technologies like flying cars and utopian cities. Instead it bought us the smartphone, social media, and online gaming. And as it turns out these technologies began to transform society almost as dramatically as the moon colonies we'd been expecting. Now over a decade into the revolution DSKNECTD explores how digital communication technology is profoundly changing the way we interact and experience each other - for the good and for the bad.(C) Gravitas</StoryLine>

            <Review>Aimed at a devotional middle-American audience, this never risks the sort of individual perspective necessary to bring the story to life onscreen, for good or ill.</Review>
            <Review>At best, this version succeeds as a Sunday school supplement. But the blandness is enough to make you long for Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ.</Review>
            <Review>People will always want to spend money for this sort of thing, even if they've already seen it. And in this case, they've literally already seen it.</Review>
            <Review>The film goes wild with helicopter shots of Jesus and his followers traveling through the hills. Who knew Christ was lord of the rings?</Review>
            <Review>The target evangelical audience may well respond enthusiastically, but, unless your own salvation is riding on it, the film is mostly a slog.</Review>
            <Review>This is more a pageant than a story about characters and their motivations; it's as brusque in its storytelling as an illustrated children's bible, which would at least offer some mystery and grandeur in the composition of its images.</Review>
            <Review>Originally, theater consisted of mystery dramas and church services. Now we have horror, slasher films, and pornography. These do not uplift humanity. But 'Son of God' tries.</Review>
            <Review>At times, the script displays a welcome sensitivity to the issues at play. But at other times, it misreads them so badly it gets downright goofy.</Review>
            <Review>Son of God is the simple case of an adaptation that doesn't have anything new or original to add to a tale that has been told many, many times before.</Review>
            <Review>Not that this cobbled-together film is done badly, but it is a choppy, by-the-numbers bland-out.</Review>
            <Review>A blandly well-intentioned biopic of an ex-carpenter-turned-prophet who caused quite a stir down Jerusalem way some 21 centuries ago.</Review>
            <Review>The hunk factor aside, it's bizarre that a film presumably conceived as an act of devotion should feel so lacklustre and impersonal.</Review>

            <Review>"In the Blood" is a dull piece of nonsense that makes one feel bad for straight-to-DVD staples like Treat Williams, Danny Trejo, and Luis Guzman.</Review>
            <Review>Carano, a former mixed-martial artist, won't be vying for an Oscar any time soon but she can more than hold her own as an action star. She deserves a bigger canvas on which to show off her skills.</Review>
            <Review>This isn't much more than a straight-forward, get-the-baddies action flick.</Review>
            <Review>The jaw-drop factor that comes from seeing Carano's moves is often spoiled because of too much cutting or, in the case of the dance club sequence, excess strobing.</Review>
            <Review>Carano is an impressive woman, but she's no Meryl Streep; and even Streep couldn't make a movie this by-the-numbers look like anything more than it is: violence with interruptions.</Review>
            <Review>The fight scenes are a letdown as they do not convey the thrill of close-quarter combat.</Review>
            <Review>In the Blood does fulfill one rite of passage for Carano, who had yet to make her own terrible, B-level movie.</Review>
            <Review>Screenwriter Andy Bloom struggles to sustain the tensions between the holed-up thugs, with much of the talented supporting cast having too little to do.</Review>

            <Review>Four of the five characters are really unlikeable, and the effect is of being trapped in a small place with five hideous people yelling at you - it's crushing, oppressive and claustrophobic.</Review>

When Robert's daughter announces that she's engaged, he advises her against it - his own marriage to Emily (Lea Thompson) didn't last, and he doesn't understand why anyone would want to give up their independence. Yet when Robert and Emily reunite and dredge up old memories and hurts, both discover they have a lot of unresolved issues and that love, marriage and divorce aren't quite as simple as they'd like.

        <StoryLine>COUSIN JULES: a rare combination of sophisticated movie-making technique (shot in CinemaScope and recorded in stereo) and content that is a veritable ode to the beauty of rural France, the simplicity of daily peasant life, and the nearly wordless intimacy of a lifelong relationship. Recording over a 5-year period, director Benicheti palpably captures the rhythms and rituals of blacksmith Jules Guiteaux and his wife F�licie as Jules dons wooden clogs and leather apron to begin work in his shop, while F�licie tends a vegetable garden and prepares their meals. Awarded the jury prize at the Locarno Film Festival in 1973 and widely acclaimed around the world, the film nevertheless remained unreleased in the U.S. until now. (c) Cinema Guild</StoryLine>

            <Review>The whole movie has a damp, logy texture. It could have used a rewrite or a re-edit just to dry it out.</Review>
            <Review>What would "The Pretty One" be without Zoe Kazan's pixieish melancholy and offbeat comic timing? Not much.</Review>
            <Review>It would take a lot of charm for "The Pretty One" to overcome that creepy premise, but the movie doesn't have it.</Review>
            <Review>"The Pretty One" is a movie with a few touching moments and others that prompt eye rolls.</Review>
            <Review>Zoe Kazan breathes fresh, exciting life into a tried-and-true high concept, playing opposite herself as twentysomething identical twins in "The Pretty One."</Review>
            <Review>[The script] takes a concept that sounds ludicrous on paper and handles it in an unexpectedly sincere, clever manner.</Review>
            <Review>The film has plenty of charm, but not enough to overcome a heaping dose of clichéd whimsy.</Review>
            <Review>Like its lead character, The Pretty One is a little unstable even as its charms are irresistible.</Review>
            <Review>Given its morbid, somewhat clichéd premise, I was pleasantly surprised by "The Pretty One." While no classic, it is both refreshingly quirky and more sensitive than expected.</Review>
            <Review>The premise of "The Pretty One" may be far-fetched, but it's carried out with sincerity and the results are amusing, ironic, and thoughtful. Here's a small-scale movie that offers a gleam of satisfaction.</Review>

            <Review>The unwillingness to "engage" in larger questions disconcertingly reduces a real-life tragedy to an action movie.</Review>

            <Review>Coming-of-age drama delivers some laughs, but loses its way when things gets serious</Review>
            <Review>"Small Time" is agreeably sentimental meat-and-potatoes fare with strong dashes of humor, executed with a sincerity that's hard to resist.</Review>
            <Review>Don't let the title of this indie gem fool you, "Small Time" has humor and heart big time.</Review>
            <Review>"Small Time" has its heart in the right place, but its screenplay's in serious need of a tuneup.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director Joel Surnow, the co-creator of 24, makes an assured, tangy feature debut with this semi-autobiographical story.</Review>
            <Review>Heartwarming and surprisingly sweet.</Review>
            <Review>Filled with humor and heart, it's an insightful, endearing father/son coming-of-age comedic drama, destined for well-deserved popularity on the DVD shelf.</Review>
            <Review>Small Time is an appropriate title for this period piece dramedy, the type of film whose meandering tone and lack of stakes inform savvy viewers of the fact that it's 'inspired by true events' even without benefit of a credits title card.</Review>
            <Review>...a decent yet unspectacular debut that could (and should) have been so much better...</Review>
            <Review>Inert from the start, and presented with little emotional depth or weight, Small Time gets the car started but doesn't go anywhere interesting.</Review>
            <Review>Toss in some scenes cleverly reminiscent of the spritzy routines of Diner (but with older folks) and the boiler-room sales tactics of Glengarry Glen Ross, and you've got the best highlights of Small Time...</Review>

        <StoryLine>How the US government created a myth that took over the world. ET visitors... crashed UFOs... back-engineered alien technology... the government cover-up of a secret that would change the world as we know it... These are the core elements of the modern UFO mythology, a story that has captivated farmers, princes and generals for generations, and shows no sign of loosening its grip on the popular imagination. But what if, instead of covering up the UFO story, elements in the US military had actively encouraged it as part of their Cold War counterintelligence arsenal - manufacturing the myth of the UFO as a powerful weapon of mass deception and the perfect cover for all manner of clandestine technologies and operations. Now, for the first time, some of those whose actions have directly shaped the UFO mythology, and some of their victims, tell their stories, revealing a surreal disturbing and sometimes tragic sequence of events that is part Manchurian Candidate and part Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Mirage Men draws viewers into a saucer-shaped hall of mirrors, a shadow-world where every lie contains elements of the truth, and the truth is far stranger than the UFO believers, or their detractors, would have you believe.</StoryLine>

        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>77</Duration>
        <StoryLine>HARRY DEAN STANTON: PARTLY FICTION is a mesmerizing, impressionistic portrait of the iconic actor comprised of intimate moments, film clips from some of his 250 films and his own heart-breaking renditions of American folk songs. Stunningly lensed in color and black and white by Seamus McGarvey, the film explores the actor's enigmatic outlook on his life, his unexploited talents as a musician, and includes candid reminiscences by David Lynch, Wim Wenders, Sam Shepard, Kris Kristofferson and Debbie Harry. The fragile soul of an actor emerges from the poignant collage. Uncensored, unguarded moments with wry humor pockmark scenes filmed at locations including Stanton's home and his favorite local watering hole, Dan Tana's in West Hollywood. Stanton discusses his friends Marlon Brando, Jack Nicholson, how his family influenced his musical leanings, the women he almost wed, and his preference for film over theatre. In the end it is an unflinching, unabashed, romantic Valentine from one artist to another, from a galvanizing truth teller to a yarn-spinning survivor. (c) Adopt</StoryLine>

            <Review>Harry Dean Stanton is a marvelous actor and, at least from a visual standpoint, a marvelous camera subject. He's not much of a talker, though.</Review>

            <Review>Huber responds to Stanton's languid opacity in ways both inspired... and insipid.</Review>
            <Review>Stanton isn't interested in giving away the details of his life and career, and no one's going to lure them out of him.</Review>
            <Review>A different kind of documentary for a different kind of guy.</Review>

            <Review>A self-aware, borderline self-reflexive action-comedy from the Netherlands, Arne Toonen's Black Out is derivative in a way that undermines its wry sense of self.</Review>
            <Review>Black Out strains to shock and offend, but at this point, 20 years after Pulp Fiction, its conception of transgression is so familiar and toothless that it borders on quaint.</Review>
            <Review>Black Out is just energetic and smartly written enough to make up for its obvious lack of originality.</Review>
            <Review>The film's references to other stylistic touchstones, while thematically apt, rarely carry any sort of critical inquiry, as if Toonen was more interested in homage for the sake of homage than as a means of contextualizing his worldview.</Review>

By turns brutally funny, wickedly honest, and unashamedly human, the film explodes personal and cultural taboos and lays bare the horror and beauty beneath our carefully composed public personas.

            <Review>Another exquisite, snail-paced cinematic perambulation from Tsai Ming-liang and Lee Kang-sheng.</Review>
            <Review>Liang's ravishing conceptual film achieves a rare blend of sensuous delight and documentary specificity.</Review>
            <Review>Journey to the West works so well because Chow has a flair for grand comic-action set pieces, and his imagination seems to actually draw energy from these rapid-fire tonal shifts.</Review>
            <Review>By turns daffy and dazzling, awkward and artful, "Journey to the West" takes an ancient tale and gives it contemporary flair.</Review>
            <Review>Mr. Chow has perhaps achieved more sustained and elaborate adventures, but he hits a sweet spot of comedy that never grows too self-aware or forgets the value of a good, clean demon whomping.</Review>
            <Review>The final product is very much Chow - with elaborately staged stunts, slapstick inspired by silent Hollywood, and a silliness that will appeal to kids (as well as some black humor that may take some explaining for younger audiences).</Review>
            <Review>Stephen Chow's Journey To The West: Conquering The Demons is a thoroughly entertaining action comedy that suggests, a la Woody Allen, a promising new life behind the screen for the actor-director.</Review>
            <Review>Chow breaks out one elaborate set-piece after another.</Review>
            <Review>It makes good use of computer animation and slapstick action comedy.</Review>
            <Review>Stephen Chow's inimitable chops for comedic action are on full display in Journey to the West.</Review>
            <Review>It is a work that appears to ask so little from its audience (not much more than patience and an alert eye), but gives a heck of a lot back.</Review>
            <Review>A kung fu comedy, a Chinese fairy story, a Buddhist action movie, a prequel to a mega-series that makes James Cameron's ambitions look puny, Chow's Journey to the West is everything that is good about China's mega-blockbuster inclinations.</Review>

            <Review>There are satisfying echoes of Stephen King's sly black humour in this deliciously nasty comedy thriller.</Review>
            <Review>Screenwriters David Chirchirillo and Trent Haaga pose a simple question -- how much will a person degrade himself to make ends meet? -- but it's a potent one, at least for those of us who ponder it every Monday through Friday.</Review>
            <Review>Let's just say it takes a dim view of human nature that seems well supported by the evidence, and that if you have an appetite for fatalistic, dirty-minded gore you won't be disappointed.</Review>
            <Review>If Cheap Thrills ultimately does carry us along, it's due largely to Healy's performance and presence.</Review>
            <Review>You should watch it as a twisted comedy. Those who do will be rewarded, especially by the film's outlandish final image.</Review>
            <Review>To describe them would diminish their impact, but there are several occasions where it is tough to keep looking at the screen. Yet, thanks to the characters and their portrayals, you can't really look away, either.</Review>
            <Review>A fantastic premise in search of a better movie...</Review>
            <Review>Strikes an astute balance between a simply engaging dark thriller and a trenchant piece of social commentary. Also it's a lot of fun.</Review>
            <Review>Cheap Thrills lives up to its name, and like many of life's guilty pleasures, it wouldn't be a surprise if audiences wanted another helping.</Review>
            <Review>Gird your stomach for Cheap Thrills, a bloody but enjoyably ironic horror which enters that queasy zone where Michael Haneke's Funny Games meets a reality-TV bush tucker trial.</Review>
            <Review>The film makes the most of its premise and small cast, zipping from low-budget drama to sick black comedy to gruesome thriller.</Review>
            <Review>Director EL Katz ratchets up the tension effectively as the game gets ever more sickeningly dark, but it's his cast's fine performances that keep us watching and give this far-fetched tale a degree of emotional plausibility.</Review>

            <Review>You don't have to be a birder to enjoy it. The movie shows that seeking the rare and elusive is often more than just a physical quest; it also is a spiritual journey that changes the seeker.</Review>
            <Review>Instead of pandering to one and only one sentiment, this engaging offering -- poised pleasantly between quaint and quirky -- does entirely right by adolescent feeling.</Review>
            <Review>The lead teens in particular give the material a realness that may not have been there on the page, and the filmmakers know enough not push the quaint story beyond the safe parameters it operates in.</Review>
            <Review>This familiar-feeling coming-of-age tale benefits from an authentic script and believable performances.</Review>
            <Review>That tidy resolution is telegraphed from the outset, but the energetic, never-mocking tone of all involved allows the film to stake its place alongside some of the genre's stronger and more enduring touchstones.</Review>
            <Review>The people who made this film brought the same loving attention to the characters that the characters do to the small feathered creatures they care for so deeply.</Review>

        <StoryLine>A headstrong Irish housewife finds her life transforming in ways she never thought possible after her husband suffers a life-altering stroke, and an American doctor arrives to chronicle the family's recovery process in this intimate drama from director Steph Green (whose short film New Boy was nominated for an Oscar in 2007). In the wake of her husband's stroke, loving wife and mother Vanetia (Maxine Peake) gradually comes to realize that her household will never be the same again. Much to Vanetia's relief, a research grant from American doctor Ted Fielding (Will Forte) provides the funds needed to remain financially afloat. Ted wants to study how the family copes with such a severe trauma, and though at first his presence in the home strikes a chord of resentment in the overburdened Vanetia, he exhibits an air of tranquility that soon becomes a source of deep comfort to her.

            <Review>Honest, and within touching distance of real poignancy.</Review>
            <Review>This film's subject matter is gloomy but, interestingly, this is not a gloomy film. Instead, it is spilling with warmth, humour, colour, life, plus the weather is mostly nice.</Review>

            <Review>Things go desperately wrong after the opening promise ...</Review>
            <Review>Endless Love lives up to its name. It's purgatory.</Review>
            <Review>This remake has almost nothing to do with Spencer's novel. It's the kind of film you make when you've run out of Nicholas Sparks books.</Review>
            <Review>Why does Hollywood continue to starve audiences longing for a good romantic tearjerker? Endless Love didn't have to be this godawful.</Review>
            <Review>"Endless Love" isn't so much a remake of the 1981 Franco Zeffirelli film as it is an extended ad for the idyllic Abercrombie &amp; Fitch lifestyle.</Review>
            <Review>Like fast food, Endless Love feels engineered to satisfy in the moment without providing any sort of nutritional value.</Review>
            <Review>Endless Love may well resonate with young women who dream of falling in love with a sexy bad boy, the rest of us will view it as forgettable romantic escapism.</Review>
            <Review>There is no point here. This is a film about beautiful, rich, white, privileged teenagers falling in love because - oh, look - I'm so beautiful and the only thing more amazing than me is me falling in love.</Review>
            <Review>for a younger audience seeking out a serious exploration of teen sexuality, Endless Love will prove to be soporific and - most disappointing of all - sexually tepid and timid.</Review>

            <Review>[A] tiresome cavalcade of bickering - which feels like it lasts even longer than your typical Thanksgiving dinner.</Review>
            <Review>"Cold Turkey" has some fine actors who put effort into their roles, but it's getting harder and harder to care about or laugh at adult characters who have botched up their affluent lives and are still obsessed with events from childhood.</Review>

            <Review>24 Exposures comes across like a clever idea that never got past the concept stage. It might have been fun for him to make, but it's definitely a chore to sit through.</Review>
            <Review>Some half-baked ideas about representation versus reality emerge in the lax improvised dialogue.</Review>
            <Review>Is Swanberg pre-empting complaints about his methods by making a film about an artist who is, if not a killer, then at least creepy and unreflective? Maybe, maybe not. But the question will only interest people who follow Swanberg's career.</Review>
            <Review>The movie ultimately becomes a queasy bromance, the foundation of which is less than flattering.</Review>
            <Review>Unfortunately, this would-be erotic thriller is just too unfocused and slapdash to satisfy its promise.</Review>
            <Review>Improvised dialogue can work wonderfully if the actors have a solid feel for their characters, but everyone here seems rushed and uncomfortable.</Review>
            <Review>Yet if, like said before, Swanberg keeps "chiseling" away, he'll maybe, one day, shape his masterpiece, no matter how much hard material there is to still get through.</Review>
            <Review>24 Exposures filters its lurid subject matter through the low-key, DIY aesthetic which Swanberg and his collaborators have cultivated over the past decade.</Review>
            <Review>Like its influences, works better as a familiar turn-on than a riveting cop drama that happens to be steamy.</Review>
            <Review>24 Exposures plays like a self-conscious joke.</Review>
            <Review>24 Exposures has a handful of interesting ideas-and a lot of cute topless girls-but it doesn't add up to much.</Review>
            <Review>There's enough that's done well in 24 Exposures that makes me wish Swanberg had gone the polished route with better actors and a larger crew.</Review>

            <Review>A Romanian political allegory - in Romanian - might sound like tough sledding, but thanks to a searing performance by Luminita Gheorghiu, "Child's Pose" is anything but.</Review>
            <Review>Perversely engrossing thanks to Gheorghiu's performance as the queen of denial.</Review>
            <Review>Netzer crafts not only a chilling story of family dysfunction, but also an illuminating look into the corruption and decay of the Romanian bourgeoisie - without ever overplaying his hand. It all appears so effortless, when in fact it's so skillful.</Review>
            <Review>A fascinating, troubling and finally controversial portrait of maternal anxiety at its most smotheringly neurotic.</Review>
            <Review>A tour-de-force performance from Gheorghiu carries this 2013 drama along, but Radulescu provides the fine edge, noting how this lioness cloaks her selfish crusade in a plea for humanity.</Review>

            <Review>Another powerfully observed Romanian drama.</Review>

            <Review>The only reason to suffer through a grim wack job called McCanick is to see the late Cory Monteith in his last film role.</Review>
            <Review>[A] numbingly inert series of dirty-cop clichés that abruptly builds to an ephemerally poignant climax.</Review>
            <Review>A fine performance by Cory Monteith isn't enough to salvage this drably derivative, infuriatingly improbable police drama.</Review>
            <Review>A completely by-the-numbers, cliched cop story for its first two thirds, before pivoting to an ending that's shocking but also totally indefensible.</Review>
            <Review>McCanick may have worked as Chief Wiggum's favorite film in The Simpsons, but as a feature film in the real world it fails to convince, and succeeds only in frustrating.</Review>
            <Review>A ho-hum B-movie with an A-list cast. Besides the solid performances, it offers nothing else to hold your interest.</Review>
            <Review>Unfortunately, this initially rote and ultimately ridiculous cop-on-the-edge drama suffers from too many creative missteps.</Review>
            <Review>The plot of McCanick, sketchy to begin with, is made even more so by Daniel Noah's woozy, fragmented script, and direction by Josh C. Waller for which "clumsy" is almost too kind a description.</Review>
            <Review>Because Noah coyly reserves the motivation for McCanick's vendetta as a third-act twist of sorts, much of McCanick simply involves watching this tortured guy mowing people down for no apparent reason.</Review>

            <Review>Preposterous, but much anxious fun.</Review>
            <Review>"Grand Piano" is an ambitious effort that plays dumb.</Review>
            <Review>Not all the right notes are hit in "Grand Piano," but for an elegantly schizoid B movie, it's more B-sharp than B-flat.</Review>
            <Review>"Grand Piano" is a tidy and tension-filled exercise in terror that takes stage fright to literal extremes.</Review>
            <Review>Once you accept that "Grand Piano" is B-movie pulp, there's a certain amount of fun to be had. This proudly old-fashioned movie will pull any trick in the book to hold your attention.</Review>
            <Review>Grand Piano is a screenwriter's fantasy of a self-conscious Hitchcockian thriller, daringly written, improbably made - and more unbelievably made well.</Review>
            <Review>Grand Piano can be enjoyed from multiple perspectives: it will satisfy the film buff, the tech hound, and the sit-back-and-be-entertained audience.</Review>
            <Review>Eugenio Mira's Grand Piano is a stylish and taut thriller that wastes no time on spectacle, instead choosing to meticulously focus on story, characters, atmosphere and building tension throughout.</Review>
            <Review>...quite engaging for the duration of its 90 minutes.</Review>
            <Review>Entertainingly preposterous ...</Review>
            <Review>It's ridiculously far-fetched, and classical concertgoers will wince at the script's wilful blunders, but flamboyant camerawork and a delicious streak of dark humour make it ridiculously enjoyable, too.</Review>
            <Review>The tension fizzles once the reasons for the gunman's motives become evident. A shame, as it's an intriguing conceit.</Review>

        <Title>The Great Flood</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>80</Duration>
        <StoryLine>The Mississippi River Flood of 1927 was the most destructive river flood in American history. In the spring of 1927, the river broke out of its earthen embankments in 145 places and inundated 27,000 square miles. Part of its legacy was the forced exodus of displaced sharecroppers, who left plantation life and migrated to Northern cities, adapting to an industrial society with its own set of challenges. Musically, the Great Migration fueled the evolution of acoustic blues to electric blues bands that thrived in cities like Memphis, Detroit and Chicago becoming the wellspring for R&amp;B and rock as well as developing jazz styles. THE GREAT FLOOD is a collaboration between filmmaker and multimedia artist Bill Morrison and guitarist and composer Bill Frisell inspired by the 1927 catastrophe. In the spring of 2011, as the Mississippi River was again flooding to levels not seen since 1927, Frisell, Morrison, and the band traveled together from New Orleans, through Vicksburg, Clarksdale, Memphis, Davenport, Iowa, St. Louis and on up to Chicago. For the film, Morrison scoured film archives, including the Fox Movietone Newsfilm Library and the National archives, for footage of the Mississippi River Flood. All film documenting this catastrophe was shot on volatile nitrate stock, and what footage remains is pock marked and partially deteriorated. The degraded filmstock figures prominently in Morrison's aesthetic with distorted images suggesting different planes of reality in the story-those lived, dreamt, or remembered.(c) Icarus</StoryLine>

            <Review>Having taken the flood out of time, Morrison plants it firmly in space - or as firm as any dreamscape can be. He's made a sort of travelog, and it's destination is inundation.</Review>
            <Review>Somehow it feels wrong to enjoy a story about so much suffering.</Review>
            <Review>Destined for a long life in museums and history classes alike, this is cinema as art, and a classic.</Review>
            <Review>Most of all it's a unique, highly immersing audio-visual experience that would be as at home in a museum as it is in a movie theater - and that's a first-order compliment.</Review>
            <Review>The movie on its own would have been nice, but with this music it's sublime.</Review>
            <Review>A striking experiment in music and moviemaking.</Review>
            <Review>The damage gives the images an appropriately mud-spattered, post-disaster appearance; sometimes the splotchy, jumpy degradation transforms these smalltown flood scenes into abstract animated splatter paintings.</Review>
            <Review>The footage itself isn't always well-preserved but director Bill Morrison incorporates it into the overall effect.</Review>
            <Review>Brief title cards orient the viewer to the history, but the moving combination of sound and image ends up being more profound than any explanatory narration could ever be.</Review>
            <Review>The Great Flood works as a wordless narrative of human endurance.</Review>
            <Review>Even in comparatively conventional mode, Bill Morrison's work still benefits from the poetic potential of nature's repossession of its own elements.</Review>

            <Review>The movie does a good job of illustrating why protecting art from the Nazi scourge was important but it's far less effective fleshing out the personalities of the people who did the protecting.</Review>
            <Review>A frustratingly flat film that drifts from moment to moment with a curious lack of urgency and an overbearing sense of self-importance.</Review>
            <Review>If The Monuments Men never overcomes its unwieldy structure and unevenness of tone, the film still manages to make a profound, even subtle point: that Hitler's darkest impulses and annihilating reach extended from human beings to history itself.</Review>
            <Review>This is a sturdy, old-school, big-scale Greatest Generation war movie. It's great escapism.</Review>
            <Review>Think of them as Inglorious Art Historians. Only this PG-13 entertainment has little of the edge, however complicated, of Quentin Tarantino's 2009 Holocaust revenge flick.</Review>
            <Review>The movie's biggest sin is a complete and utter lack of dramatic tension.</Review>
            <Review>It has its heart in the right place and Clooney does a technically proficient job, but there's no denying that it is a significant disappointment.</Review>
            <Review>If you've ever doubted how thoroughly a poor score can wreck an otherwise perfectly acceptable motion picture, get thee to 'Monuments Men.'</Review>
            <Review>'Monuments Men' is the vapidly-told story of the men who set out to thwart ol' Schicklgruber's (Hitler's father's real name) dastardly, top-to-bottom European art-ransack.</Review>
            <Review>Clooney directed and co-wrote the movie, so let's give the guy credit for successfully pulling off its Ocean's 11-meets-The Dirty Dozen vibe.</Review>
            <Review>Plays like an outtake reel interspersed with scenes of real dramatic weight, making for one of the most uneven cinematic rides in recent memory.</Review>

            <Review>[Director Jeremiah Chechik] imposes a stiff pace on the proceedings, toggling between broad physical comedy that aches for a laugh track and oddball moments of genuine whimsy.</Review>

            <Review>As the film progresses, and it becomes more and more heavily focused on the inevitable romantic linking of the male and female leads (including some late-film plot machinations that could have been left out), it loses steam and starts to feel perfunctory.</Review>
            <Review>Teeming with mismanaged ideas, but Kwanten's blank slate approach crushes the picture's hope for lasting appeal.</Review>
            <Review>The film is so in love with its unoriginal premise that it can't see the forest for the trees, treating reality like an occasionally relevant prop and stalking as a sweetly romantic gesture.</Review>
            <Review>Mistakenly convinced that cuteness can compensate for a lack of basic believability, The Right Kind Of Wrong squanders its engaging leads and cheerful joviality with a plot of stupefying senselessness.</Review>

            <Review>It's most remarkable as a pairing of two inspired actresses with four decades separating them: 25-year-old Elizabeth Olsen, the bewitching star of Martha Marcy May Marlene, and 64-year-old Jessica Lange.</Review>
            <Review>For those who want sweeping, "In Secret" offers all the essentials - unbridled passion, deceit, fate so unkind, a classically creepy mother and grand tragedy.</Review>
            <Review>Despite its able cast and handsome period costumes, In Secret is, in fact, quite awful.</Review>
            <Review>An effective period piece thriller that incorporates love, lust, desperation, and madness into a stew thickened by a gothic atmosphere.</Review>
            <Review>Olsen and Isaac never really create the kind of amour fou that a story like this depends on, let alone the self-loathing guilt that their crime is supposed to engender.</Review>
            <Review>Isaac is better in his early scenes as a seducer, Olsen is better in her bitter, angry later scenes, but they synch up by the film's over-the-top last moments.</Review>
            <Review>While the elements aren't often as neatly assembled as they should be, I give In Secret credit, for it's surprisingly fun, as imperfect as it is.</Review>
            <Review>Olsen is one of Hollywood's best young actresses. There is nothing she can't do. In the long run, it's the men who'll wish they'd done more to support her suffocating sense of loneliness here.</Review>
            <Review>The film's most striking performance comes from Jessica Lange, evoking both distaste and sympathy as the heroine's overbearing mother-in-law.</Review>
            <Review>No knocks to Emile Zola -- who wrote the 1867 French novel which serves as In Secret's source material -- but the story is stretched excruciatingly thin in this adaptation.</Review>
            <Review>Lange at least has an angle on her character; the rest of the cast simply hit their marks and spout dialogue like robots, delivering lines which should evoke erotic fervour, but are exchanged without urgency, conviction or belief.</Review>
            <Review>Notable largely for the anguished, nuanced performance of Jessica Lange ...</Review>

            <Review>This is a garbage heap of weak quips, delivered by an assortment of pretty boys and girls and amped up with some cheesy moments of animal cruelty.</Review>
            <Review>Not only plays like the crassest possible mashup of "Harry Potter" and "Twilight" elements, but seems designed to make those franchises look like eternal monuments of world culture by comparison.</Review>
            <Review>This attempt to capture the magic of the "Twilight" and "Harry Potter" franchises tries too hard to pack all the backstory and borrowings into one film.</Review>
            <Review>[Mr. Waters] doesn't seem especially interested in the supernatural parts of "Vampire Academy," and he clearly didn't have the budget to make what little hocus-pocus there is magical.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately more "Meaningless" than "Mean Girls," "Vampire Academy" is a busy, overcomplicated empowerment fantasy with more hormones than brain cells.</Review>
            <Review>The only thing that distinguishes this teen-magnet wannabe from its predecessors is how lazily it appears to have been slapped together.</Review>
            <Review>Vampire Academy is often more fun than many brainless supernatural tween films.</Review>
            <Review>What's saddest of all is that the Gen Y audience this is meant for will be so busy texting during the film they won't notice how poor it is, they'll love it -- and there will be a sequel.</Review>
            <Review>...I hoped for better but am not displeased with slightly messy, campy but funny and entertaining vamp dramedy I got.</Review>
            <Review>It's too transparently a ploy to hook teenage girls by combining vampires, Hogwarts, and princesses, three things that teenage girls presumably adore.</Review>
            <Review>A film that attempts to satire the popular love triangle romances of the current day, yet falls into the same tired cliches of said films.</Review>
            <Review>The action is underwhelming and the plot muddled, taking so long to explain the saga's complex mythology that there's no time left to flesh out the characters. Which is a shame, as Deutch's heroine has a sassy spark.</Review>

            <Review>The performances and plotting are so impoverished that the picture deserves to be called "The From Hunger Games," and then promptly forgotten.</Review>
            <Review>Prurient nonsense, a film only a couple of notches up from the women-in-prison films that were popular years and years ago.</Review>
            <Review>If "Raze" had been released in 1975, Quentin Tarantino would never shut up about it.</Review>
            <Review>The lack of story and relentless suffering make "Raze" appealing for hard-core genre fans only.</Review>
            <Review>"Raze" is a sweaty, queasy, bruising experience - and a superbly crafted film.</Review>
            <Review>If you can stand to watch this movie -- a big if -- there is food for thought here about the subjugation and exploitation of women, the limits of psychological and physical endurance, and more.</Review>
            <Review>With plots as flimsy as the one presented here, there's a tendency to favor spectacle over character development, and it's no surprise that Raze struggles to balance the two.</Review>
            <Review>The fights are visceral and gruesome without going too far, but by the sixth or seventh bout, the lack of variation becomes noticeable.</Review>
            <Review>Raze ultimately becomes little more than a tiresome endurance test ... Still, much like a less accomplished The Raid, some viewers may respond to its bloody, take-no-prisoners style.</Review>
            <Review>The film favors brutal violence over any sort of social commentary, making its half-hearted stab at female empowerment feel hollow.</Review>
            <Review>The tease of 50 gorgeous women fighting to the death has a classic grindhouse appeal, but Raze is strictly a "be careful what you wish for" proposition.</Review>
            <Review>As violent as it is, Raze is refreshing.</Review>

            <Review>Every gag is premised on the fact that Renner allows his work and personal lives to overlap, though this contradicts everything we've been told about him and would obviously heighten the risk to his loved ones.</Review>
            <Review>Pure trash but it's entertaining as hell.</Review>
            <Review>The movie never finds a way to blend the emotional and the rat-a-tat-tat into one seamless package the way that Besson did in his one and only good movie, The Professional.</Review>
            <Review>How did 3 Days to Kill, which doesn't have the worst imaginable premise, turn out this bad?</Review>
            <Review>To the degree that the film works, it's because Costner plays the straight man.</Review>
            <Review>The film itself is a tone-deaf, awkward mess that is miles below the actor's maligned bombs like Waterworld and The Postman.</Review>
            <Review>( ... ) a mindlessly entertaining, disjointed, frequently unbelievable hell-for-leather action adventure.</Review>
            <Review>Fine, in a mid-budget, wholly inconsequential way.</Review>
            <Review>3 Days to Kill is a frequently bizarre, never boring mash-up that doesn't come together yet perfectly encapsulates everything both good and bad about Luc Besson's recent output</Review>
            <Review>French filmmaker Luc Besson continues to combine family themes with intense violence (see Taken), but at least this film has a wry sense of humour about it.</Review>
            <Review>Something very special: a Kevin Costner vehicle that makes both The Postman and Waterworld seem fearsomely substantial.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Written and directed by Tom Petch, ex-Army, The Patrol takes a piercing look at the conflict in Afghanistan through the eyes of a British Army patrol who, alongside the Afghan Army, are fighting the Taliban, an invisible, deadly enemy.

Faced with low ammunition, injury and rising tensions under the command of a captain who is out of touch with his men, the exhausted, disillusioned soldiers question their role in the war.(c) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>Unfortunately, the writing and acting aren't quite sharp enough to make The Patrol a must-see for curious liberals. And the visual effects will underwhelm audiences in search of action.</Review>
            <Review>The wearing tedium of conflict is effectively evoked, broken occasionally by bursts of violence that are rightly harrowing.</Review>
            <Review>A rough experience, bracingly free of the usual macho posturing that characterizes movies about the military, and a compassionate and humane portrait of modern soldiering.</Review>
            <Review>First-time British writer-director Tom Petch makes a powerful impression with this tough, smart war movie on a shrewdly managed small scale, about a British army patrol in Afghanistan.</Review>
            <Review>This bungled sortie in Helmand province presents a robust idea that's been executed poorly.</Review>
            <Review>A well executed minor drama that casts a careful life on the inner lives of military personnel, and promises good things to come in terms of the young cast, and Tom Petch's future career.</Review>
            <Review>As lofty as [the director's] ambitions may be, though, his abilities don't yet match them.</Review>
            <Review>Quote not available.</Review>
            <Review>This is an unsparing and occasionally bleak look at the frustrations of fighting an unwinnable war with inadequate gear.</Review>
            <Review>It's a solid debut, with Petch's evocative location filming (in Morocco) and pyrotechnic flourishes belying his low budget.</Review>

            <Review>On paper, About Last Night is a third-generation copy of David Mamet's 1974 stage play Sexual Perversity in Chicago -- but if anything... it comes closer to Mamet's rancorous vision of dueling hormones than the '80s screen version did.</Review>
            <Review>While this version lacks the subtlety of the original, it delivers enough raunchy humor to be far more entertaining.</Review>
            <Review>The 2014 model of About Last Night... it beefs up the girl-side element of the story, incorporates considerably more frank sex talk, and generally provides its cast with a lot more meat to chew on and spit back out.</Review>
            <Review>Mostly, Hart aces his many showcase moments, not so much stealing the movie as occasionally letting the other actors possess it for a while.</Review>
            <Review>Neither director Steve Pink nor screenwriter Leslye Headland put much effort into basic storytelling.</Review>
            <Review>his film has the looseness of a movie made of outtakes -- but they mostly work, and they mostly involve Hall and Hart. They're the undercard that takes over the movie.</Review>
            <Review>It's the small observations that make About Last Night worthwhile.</Review>
            <Review>You don't just walk out thinking that you deserve better relationships from now on, but that you also deserve better movies like this one.</Review>
            <Review>This must be why I'm single. Who wants to be with a guy who looks forward to the complications a significant other will add to my life? Why can't you complain your girlfriend, Fred?</Review>
            <Review>Hart and Hall are downright lovable, their individual live wire comic energies even further elevated in the face of a formidable foil--and that resulting charge also translates into an appropriately volatile and exciting erotic electricity.</Review>
            <Review>The main problem here is the less-than-convincing nature of Danny and Debbie's squabbles...</Review>
            <Review>A remake in name only, "About Last Night" is a poorly directed series of Kevin Hart skits with an occasional emotional moment somehow finding its way onto the screen.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Academy Award-winning filmmaker Roger Ross Williams (Music by Prudence) explores the role of the American Evangelical movement in fueling Uganda's terrifying turn towards biblical law and the proposed death penalty for homosexuality in this enlightening but shocking expos�. Thanks to charismatic religious leaders and a well-financed campaign, these draconian new laws and the politicians that peddle them are winning over the Ugandan public. But these dangerous policies and the money that fuels them aren't coming from Africa, they're being imported from some of America's largest megachurches. Using v�rit�, interviews, and hidden camera footage, the film allows American religious leaders and their young missionaries that make up the "front lines in a battle for billions of souls" to explain their positions in their own words.

            <Review>The refreshing thing about this otherwise formulaic romantic comedy is that writer-director Tom Gormican gives the verbal humor some rhythm, shooting many of the dialogue-driven scenes in long takes so they develop a pleasing ebb and flow.</Review>
            <Review>A moderately smart movie would have pushed back against the formula. That Awkward Moment simply mistakes being obnoxious for being clever.</Review>
            <Review>The movie's ideas about relationships would've felt middle-of-the-road in the '80s, and its big epiphany moments (Guys can fall in love, too!) are shallow enough to make you long for the comparatively profound rom-com oeuvre of Kate Hudson.</Review>
            <Review>First-time writer-director Tom Gormican keeps the dialogue moving at a rapid pace, which doesn't obscure the fact that most of what is said is dopey and witless.</Review>
            <Review>Only a sociopath would behave this carelessly, and as such, That Awkward Moment makes for an interesting study in abnormal criminal behavior.</Review>
            <Review>Take three horny guys, all twentysomethings, mix with a plot that was old last century, and serve to an audience so desperate toilet gags they might forgive a movie wired only with clichés.</Review>
            <Review>Dull, narcissistic and disconnected from humanity, That Awkward Moment contains not an ounce of real humanity or organic character development.</Review>
            <Review>"That Awkward Moment" is perfectly titled - as in that awkward moment when your romantic comedy isn't at all romantic and often blithely unfunny.</Review>
            <Review>From the outside That Awkward Moment looks like a typical, throwaway comedy but it has heart and an indie spirit that turn it into something altogether different, something that deserves to be seen.</Review>
            <Review>Playing like an explicit, junior equivalent of Sex And The City combined with the emotional immaturity that Adam Sandler delivers with his own style of ensemble movies, the film's plot lines are messy and unfocused.</Review>

            <Review>Khan's gift for effortlessly moving between comedy and love scenes is complemented by Padukone's striking beauty and comic chops.</Review>
            <Review>It's just enough of a change of pace for Rohit Shetty to seem like a radical step forward without being so much of one as to be unrecognizable, as it's still funny and exciting, and the visuals pop.</Review>
            <Review>Shetty's need to maintain his characters' romantic heroism constantly grates against his depictions of their ridiculousness.</Review>
            <Review>The movie chugs along for most of its 2 hours and 20 minutes searching for comedy and characters in a frantically overplotted story.</Review>
            <Review>It breaks my heart to tell you that Chennai Express left me cold.</Review>
            <Review>ShahRukh is himself, the star. Deepika Padukone fits the role of Meena perfectly and looks beautiful as the Southern belle.</Review>
            <Review>Like the southbound train of the title, Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan's romantic action-comedy-musical Chennai Express barrels forward with barely a stop to rest.</Review>
            <Review>A loud, lame-brained romantic comedy from the (very) broad directorial brush of Rohit Shetty, SRK's over-hyped vehicle sees the charismatic but ageing actor badly miscast and easily overshadowed by his leading lady, Deepika Padukone.</Review>
            <Review>This Bollywood farce, dressed in the colourful costumes of a romantic adventure with music, is an oversize comedy and a couple of hours (plus intermission) of sheer escapism</Review>
            <Review>Jump aboard the Chennai Express for a full-on, SRK-fueled joyride.</Review>
            <Review>Once he runs out of jokes and jeeps to explode, Shetty dodders in classic stereotypes as well as his fondness for saturated colours, tossing in ugly visual effects.</Review>
            <Review>After Cocktail and Yeh Jaawani Hai Deeewani, Deepika is once again in superlative form.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>For a documentary about extreme discipline, the filmmakers lack restraint: the movie, about 20 minutes too long, undercuts much of its own momentum.</Review>
            <Review>The oversized men who compete for the title of Mr. Olympia in this illuminating documentary are articulate and serious-minded, with some muscling through adversity to find a way to their dreams.</Review>
            <Review>"Iron" opens a window to an exclusive club and gives valuable insight into a small, dedicated and proudly unique community.</Review>
            <Review>Yudin's deft cameras admiringly capture these iconically sculpted men without overly objectifying them, should the prospect of eyeballing all that posing-strapped beef give any potential viewers pause.</Review>
            <Review>A gorgeous meditation on age-old existential concerns.</Review>
            <Review>...just about enough memorable quotes, eloquence, personality, and pathos to divert even those of us with no interest in sport.</Review>
            <Review>It's mostly a polite, controlling-authority-approved peek into the world of competition bodybuilding, though not enough to dissuade fans from taking a look.</Review>
            <Review>Suffers from a reality TV-ish veneer in its decided lack of depth.</Review>
            <Review>While Yudin gives us plenty of room to laugh at them, he also acknowledges their capacity to inspire awe - not only at their bulging muscles, but at their willingness to go all the way with the infantile wish to look bigger than anyone else.</Review>
            <Review>Yudin gets into the psyches of his subjects. Their ups and downs, highs and lows. The need to do well in competitions not only for personal glory but for the sponsorships that feed their families and keep them in the gym.</Review>
            <Review>Well-crafted, sympathetic and apparently fairly honest, but not as novel as it would have been in the pre-reality TV era, when the home lives of participants in obsessive family units and strange subcultures weren't an entertainment staple.</Review>
            <Review>... we are left to consider natural gifts versus applied science, and ponder why we usually credit the former more than the latter. Like all good stories, this movie about bodybuilding is really about much more.</Review>

Only when Alex has a chance encounter at a local Christian summer camp, does she finally receive the wake-up call she so desperately needs. But will it be enough to truly turn her life around or will she just return to her bullying ways once camp is over? Camp Harlow is a touching story of redemption and hope.

        <Reviews>
            <Review>Too often does [Bondarchuk] goad his characters to brim over with righteous bloodlust-and, despite the occasional obligatory misgiving about the barbarism of war, goads the audience to lust right along with them.</Review>
            <Review>If you thought Saving Private Ryan needed to be more like 300, then Stalingrad is the movie for you.</Review>
            <Review>Overall, Stalingrad is a bizarre concoction, part Putin-era patriotic chest-thumping and part creaky war melodrama, all set in a superbly recreated ruined city.</Review>
            <Review>Stalingrad is long and operatic, but its message is simple enough: War is hell, but hell, it makes for good cinema.</Review>
            <Review>To wave a flag, sing a song and celebrate it as the uncomplicated and inevitable victory of good over evil is the sort of easy message only an old propagandist - or a president for life - could really cheer.</Review>
            <Review>I'd recommend it just for the window it provides into popular entertainment on the other side of the world.</Review>
            <Review>The film establishes itself as a work of national pride wrapped in the form of a heritage spectacle.</Review>
            <Review>Fedor Bondarchuk's bloody battle epic celebrates the excesses of war cinema far more effectively than it does the heroism of his countrymen.</Review>
            <Review>It's exciting to see post-communism Russian cinema patriotically revisiting its own history like this. I didn't mind the clichés, because part of Stalingrad's 131-minute charm is that in some ways it feels 40 years old.</Review>
            <Review>Stalingrad is far from a perfect war film, but it does add up to an overall gratifying visual experience.</Review>
            <Review>while the narrative encourages a sense of philosophical reflection about the horrors of war, the film's video-game-inspired look constantly puts us at a distance by overly aestheticizing the violence with extreme slow motion and bullet time effects</Review>
            <Review>Stalingrad is a film that is completely lacking in substance, not only on the basic storytelling level, but also on the human level.</Review>

            <Review>Probably of interest only to those viewers who, like Gondry himself apparently, already have an obsession with Chomsky.</Review>
            <Review>What emerges from the chats and the drawings and the animation is an often-fascinating glimpse at both genius and the creative process (itself a kind of genius, after all). If it sounds boring, it isn't. If it sounds weird, it is - but weird in a good way.</Review>
            <Review>Tthe onscreen result is a striking inquiry into how we comprehend the world, neatly divided between a man of words and a man of images</Review>

            <Review>We are watching two very fascinating, very different minds interact, and the result is a bit inspiring.</Review>
            <Review>Reveals a comfortable Gondry on the film work. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>The result is a stop-motion animation that, by their color, dynamic and originality, is quite attractive visually. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>I only wished the well-meaning documentary would have been less cutesy and opened up more doors into Chomsky's progressive thinking.</Review>
            <Review>Some of the film's best and most revealing moments see Gondry trying to get a slightly wary Chomsky to leave his comfort zone of cerebral conjecture and open up about his emotional life.</Review>

            <Review>Here's hoping there's no follow-up to the amazingly dull adventures of Frankenstein's Monster.</Review>
            <Review>It takes less than four minutes to realise that this Underworld-style, graphic novel adaptation won't keep anyone in the audience sitting bolt upright for long.</Review>
            <Review>Humanity's fate hangs in the balance, but it's hard to work up much excitement for the routine CGI-boosted battles between good and evil forces, or for the less than sparky rapport between Eckhart's Monster and Strahovski's lissome blonde scientist.</Review>

            <Review>You may or may not be convinced, but you will be affected.</Review>
            <Review>"After Tiller" does viewers the great service of providing light where there's usually only heat, giving a human face and heart to what previously might have been an abstract issue or quickly scanned news item.</Review>
            <Review>What makes this well-edited film compelling are the stories of the patients and the agonizing moral quandaries that the doctors express in doing their work.</Review>
            <Review>It's a calm, thoughtful film about an incendiary subject, and it has a clear point of view: to allow these doctors (and some of their patients, who we hear but don't see) to explain why they do what they do.</Review>
            <Review>Any viewer with an interest in this issue, whether pro-life, pro-choice or agnostic, ought to see this heart-piercing report from the front lines.</Review>
            <Review>This wrenching documentary, profiling the four doctors who still provide third-trimester abortions in the U.S., is remarkable for being so level-headed.</Review>
            <Review>Engaging and thoughtful, After Tiller's examination of its main subjects forms a documentary that wisely treats its subject with more curiosity than dogma.</Review>
            <Review>More than simply informative (which it most certainly is), After Tiller is a reminder that seeing eye-to-eye is rarely as impossible as we might think.</Review>
            <Review>This documentary portrait of abortion doctors in America, particularly those who perform late-term abortions, looks at those who do important, compassionate work, but isn't as engaging as it should be.</Review>
            <Review>The film goes about its grave task with compassion, basic professionalism, and discretion.</Review>
            <Review>Directors Martha Shane and Lana Wilson in this topical documentary ably tackle in a fair-minded and detailed way the controversial issue of third-trimester abortions.</Review>
            <Review>Rarely is this issue presented so fairly and without the requisite hysteria.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>A stunning minimalist erotic thriller that explores with arresting photography and economical use of dialogue how human identity is defined, and sometimes imprisoned, by our desires, drives, and passions.</Review>
            <Review>Carefully and often brilliantly creates its own Eden-like universe.</Review>
            <Review>There's too much metaphysical packaging material in the story; it's half Styrofoam peanuts. But its ideas are intriguing and its murky suspense is undeniable.</Review>
            <Review>What sets the engrossing "Stranger by the Lake" apart is that its excesses seem to point to a moral purpose beyond shock or entertainment value.</Review>
            <Review>A simple and ruthlessly effective exercise in minimal narrative and style, Alain Guiraudie's moral tale is so restrained and atmospheric that the nudity and graphic sex don't upstage the creepy mood of seductive, inescapable doom.</Review>
            <Review>This lake is a sexual refuge, about to be stained by sin and blood.</Review>
            <Review>the stuff of porn flicks and of classical Greek sculpture, and it is to Alain Guiraudie's credit that he evokes the spirit of both as well as a dandy, ahem, Hitchcockian thriller</Review>
            <Review>While I found the characters interesting, the story was not very compelling and it was slow-moving as well. I learned a lot more about homosexual sex techniques than I wanted to know, and less about the characters than I wanted to know.</Review>
            <Review>Perfect, in that it achieves exactly what it meant to... portrays the world of casual sex and cruising with almost journalistic proficiency.</Review>
            <Review>Franck, so akin to Philip in Somerset Maugham's Of Human Bondage, knows in his heart that he is making a potentially deadly mistake, but his insatiable lust won't hear a word of it.</Review>

            <Review>A sublimely original film about human connections that feels personal - yet makes a haunting statement about all of society.</Review>
            <Review>It's an odd, sad love story, combined with a meditation on technology as an accelerator of social loneliness. Not a small part of it seems to be an allegory of lonely guys and their fear of women.</Review>
            <Review>In a dark theater, surrounded by the wondrous world Jonze creates in Her, it's difficult to avoid getting emotional.</Review>
            <Review>Her shares a lot of themes with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, another story about the difficulty of moving on from relationships that once seemed destined to last forever.</Review>
            <Review>Delightfully entertaining, if slightly unnerving ...</Review>
            <Review>Jonze's film is a quietly unsettling and impressive accomplishment, one that makes us believe its protagonists are in love despite the fact they can never be together.</Review>
            <Review>Her is among the more pleasurable, immediately satisfying, and appreciably ambivalent of techno-love tales.</Review>
            <Review>One half of the relationship at the center of 'Her' may lack a physical form, but it is nonetheless a film about the universality of romance: its longing, its intensity, and its transformative power - for the best, and the worst.</Review>
            <Review>Her is set in the future, but its genius is the fact that it's a love story of our times.</Review>
            <Review>Spike Jonze has journeyed into a genuinely rare genre here - the sci-fi drama - and emerged as victorious as ever.</Review>
            <Review>This is an astoundingly written, directed and acted film that subtly infuses all its emotional and philosophical layers effortlessly and indiscreetly.</Review>

            <Review>The steadily affecting relationship drama "Stay" is a great example of how a film can rise above its terrible dialogue.</Review>
            <Review>The film was adapted from a novel by Aislinn Hunter, but the characters' inner lives remain elusive.</Review>
            <Review>Static and uninvolving despite a decent cast.</Review>
            <Review>Despite the affecting performances by the two leads, this overly muted drama fails to make much of an impact.</Review>
            <Review>The somber mood lifts like clouds after a storm, at a pace just sluggish enough that the happy ending doesn't seem too gratuitous.</Review>
            <Review>Too often ... the darker, more serious moments in Stay are only temporary distractions from the main event - a familiar tale of romantic separation and reconciliation.</Review>
            <Review>Try as it does, Stay remains an awkward near miss with too often what should be subtext is front and center.</Review>
            <Review>A character-driven drama about the ways the past intrudes on the characters' perceptions of what is possible for them.</Review>
            <Review>There are other small triumphs that carry the film.</Review>
            <Review>The knife that tried to half this potato gets stuck somewhere along the way, and by the time we meander towards the foregone conclusion, the fumes force us to turn away and not look back.</Review>
            <Review>I can't imagine what type of picture there would be without Quinn and Schilling's commitment, but their professional investment helps to save a mediocre movie from becoming just another bland soul-searching drama.</Review>
            <Review>While there's always a case to be made for filmmaking that doesn't traffic in artificially heightened emotions, the solution isn't necessarily to bring things in under the bar, either.</Review>

            <Review>Some of "Chlorine's" scenes go for a pat lifestyle satire that can be diverting enough but feels secondhand. Elsewhere it makes wobbly overtures toward unearned dramatic poignancy ...</Review>
            <Review>Mired in the blahs, the blues and the midlife crazies, this poor man's "American Beauty" slowly sucks your will to live.</Review>
            <Review>It's not a good movie, and yet there are persistent good bits.</Review>
            <Review>Unfortunately, better movies have already been made about the subject, from the underrated film The Joneses to the current Wolf of Wall Street.</Review>
            <Review>A flat, undercooked suburban comedy. Or is it a drama? Or maybe a kind of satire? Regardless, it's short on style, substance or any clear raison d'être.</Review>
            <Review>Jay Alaimo's tiresome dramatic comedy often seems as if it were assembled using the cut-up technique favored by Burroughs and his beat contemporaries, in which clichés are thrown together and arbitrarily rearranged.</Review>
            <Review>The admirable wit that's on display when it comes to subtle motifs and the poignant conclusion that resonates if you let it, regardless of how predictable or not it may seem, are all things that add up to a satisfactory feeling.</Review>
            <Review>An apt alternate title for this lightweight comedy/drama might be A Woodchuck in the Suburbs - for, like the slightly more serious The Wolf of Wall Street, it shows that no matter where they are, greed makes people do crazy things.</Review>
            <Review>The film is about how adults can sometimes act like children, and the unforeseen consequences that result. We know, because [Kyra] Sedgwick says it out loud in the third act.</Review>
            <Review>Derivative and unresponsive, Chlorine tanks every idea it submits, incapable of achieving the pathos it sets out for itself, lost to filmmaking limitation and thematic inertia.</Review>
            <Review>Chlorine is lacking in just about everything: wit, dramatic momentum, cohesion, etc. A wildly underdeveloped film.</Review>
            <Review>Every time Jay Lifton's self-consciously quirky music kicks in, it undermines everything else. It sounds more like Lifton is making fun of indie comedies rather than participating in one.</Review>

        <Duration>91</Duration>
        <StoryLine>At the heart of GENIUS ON HOLD is the story of Walter L. Shaw-a brilliant inventor with an astonishing list of telecommunications patents to his name including call forwarding, touchtone dialing, speakerphone and voice recognition. His ground-breaking designs should have earned him great fortune and lasting fame, but for one thing-the power, greed, and oppression of AT&amp;T, the largest, government-sanctioned, telecommunications monopoly in the United States which blocked him from realizing his dream. Punished, imprisoned, and eventually destitute, Shaw was drawn to the only organization that would reward him for his talent-the mob, whose bookies used his "black box" and "blue box" to run their gambling operations and evade the Feds. His son, Walter T. Shaw, embittered by his father's destruction, turned to organized crime and became one of the most notorious jewel thieves in American history. All to get back at the system that destroyed his family -- but at what cost?</StoryLine>

            <Review>The film is an obvious labor of love for all concerned, and the good times are infectious.</Review>
            <Review>The uninitiated may not go for the all-too-convenient crime solving, melodramatic love triangle, and playful banter, but cultists will find all the show's pleasures intact.</Review>
            <Review>Veronica herself is such a breath of fresh air as a strong female character: smart, secure, resourceful, loyal, funny and not the slightest bit chickish.</Review>
            <Review>This isn't just a nostalgia trip. Almost a decade has passed, and the characters aren't just older, they've changed in recognizable and gratifying ways.</Review>
            <Review>Somehow, miraculously, the Veronica Mars movie is definitely not bad. It's pretty damn good, actually.</Review>
            <Review>All in all the movie delivers what you expect but not in the way that you expect it, which makes it work as both a long-delayed fourth chapter in Veronica's story and a rare big-screen version of a TV show ...</Review>
            <Review>As a whole, I loved the movie. It felt like filmed fanfic, and I mean that in the best possible way: No pretension.</Review>
            <Review>Veronica Mars retains all of the humor and intriguing human dimension it possessed while on the air.</Review>
            <Review>It's basically a two-hour episode of the show. And I mean that as the highest compliment.</Review>
            <Review>The tone is exactly right, and the passage of a few years has been good on everyone's looks.</Review>
            <Review>Despite its middle-class magnolia feel in one respect, it has some sharp lines, twists and turns, revived characters, a neat score and good jokes about Warner Bros' stalwart Clint Eastwood.</Review>
            <Review>A return to the admired television series is equal parts fun and frustrating.</Review>

            <Review>A derivative heist thriller-comedy that passes painlessly enough at a brisk 90 minutes, but ultimately feels as disposable as the numerous counterfeit paintings that exchange hands throughout.</Review>
            <Review>There are a handful of actors working today whose mere presence justifies whatever film they are in. Kurt Russell is at the top of a very short list for me, and has been so for decades.</Review>
            <Review>An uneven, mildly amusing, and highly derivative flick featuring a wonderful, quirky cast as a crew of art thieves who run a complex scam on the art world, and on each other.</Review>
            <Review>Matt Dillon and Kurt Russell may not make the most convincing half-brothers, but "The Art of the Steal" is a fairly amusing heist film with some sibling tension helping the story along.</Review>
            <Review>Director Jonathan Sobol clearly understands the first rule of a good grift: misdirection. He packs his middling caper flick with so many known faces, it's easy to miss all the other familiarities.</Review>
            <Review>Snappy, clever, broadly comedic and too obvious for words, of which there are many.</Review>
            <Review>While neither the smartest nor the funniest film, it does give enough of both to warrant forgiveness.</Review>
            <Review>With one contrived plot twist too many the final act descends into a fug of farce stealing the film's early promise.</Review>
            <Review>Occasionally charming, yet completely unoriginal, this is dumb fun, no more, no less.</Review>
            <Review>An appealing cast almost make the difference to this film, a sloppy half-hearted caper that never seems to break sweat.</Review>
            <Review>An entertaining lark.</Review>
            <Review>There's little that's unfamiliar about director Jonathan Sobol's switchbacking caper so he winningly cashes in on the strength of his cast, particularly Russell's world-weary con and a scene-stealing Stamp as the languidly insolent Brit.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Based on true events, Sugar is the story of a young girl with a troubled past trying to survive on the streets of Venice Beach. Sugar suffers from PTSD after losing her entire family in a horrific car crash. She survives with her group of outcast friends on the streets of Venice Beach trying to find their own place in the world. Like so many homeless youth, Sugar is running from the pain of her past and will do anything to escape it. However with the help of Bishop, her counselor in the youth shelter, she is able to reconnect with her uncle who has been searching for her. Sugar's new world starts to crumble when forced to confront the demons she's run from for the last two years. Sugar is an all too common story of a troubled youth learning how to stop hiding, and to start healing. We take a realistic look at what forces so many of our youth onto the streets and what they go through to survive. It is not a story of redemption, it is a story of reality.

            <Review>What begins as a rather sweet gay romance and intriguing character study unfortunately degenerates into a luridly over-the-top farrago</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2012</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>122</Duration>
        <StoryLine>An epic drama spanning the years 1939 to 1952, this is the gripping story of Simon (Bill Skarsgaard), who grows up in a loving working class family on the outskirts of Gothenburg but always feels out of place. He finally convinces his father to send him to an upper-class grammar school, where he meets Isak, the son of a wealthy Jewish bookseller who has fled Nazi persecution in Germany. Simon is dazzled by the books, art and music he encounters in the home of Isak's father Ruben (Jan Josef Leifers), which makes Simon long to know more about his own family background. Isak, on the other hand, draws comfort from learning to do something with his hands, helping Simon's dad (Stefan Godicke) make boats. When Isak faces trouble at home, he is taken in by Simon's family and the two households slowly merge, connecting in unexpected ways as war rages all over Europe. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>"Simon and the Oaks" branches out in ways unusual and interesting enough to hold your attention and then even shake it a bit.</Review>
            <Review>The sheer sincerity of everyone concerned bolsters the whole enterprise so that Ohlin's historical novel-on-film holds us.</Review>
            <Review>"Simon and the Oaks" is not merely the story of two boys from opposite sides of the tracks. It's also a larger meditation on life's hardships and what endures: love, art and civilization.</Review>
            <Review>With its fool's-gold cinematography, over-emphatic musical score and self-important protagonist, "Simon and the Oaks" is a puny acorn that dreams it's a towering achievement.</Review>
            <Review>[A] lush, handsomely crafted middlebrow epic ...</Review>
            <Review>It's a warmly done family and personal drama that seems to cover familiar territory, but only up to a point and very much in its own way.</Review>
            <Review>Contains more than one emotionally potent scene and never takes the easy shortcuts.</Review>
            <Review>Significant enough to be name-checked in the title, the trees hang over the film, threatening to impose heavy metaphor on what is otherwise a straightforward family saga.</Review>
            <Review>The German occupation barely makes an impression in Lisa Ohlin's sluggish adaptation of Marianne Fredriksson's novel.</Review>
            <Review>Simon and the Oaks is a lot of things, but above all, it is too much.</Review>
            <Review>So much is thrown at the audience, it makes it difficult to focus or choose the important points in this sprawling story.</Review>

            <Review>An action-packed look at the men who do their best to keep Detroit from going up in flames.</Review>
            <Review>These stories are moving, but what really distinguishes the film is the sense of an entire city giving in to self-immolation.</Review>
            <Review>An emotional character study of a group of heroic, yet very human, individuals.</Review>
            <Review>The film makes you thankful for members of this macho breed, who relish risking their lives to save others.</Review>
            <Review>Burn captures the danger (and, yes, excitement) of putting out blazes, as well as the futility of dousing flames in a city rife with arson-and the struggles to maintain adequate funding in a wrecked economy that hits the public sector hardest.</Review>
            <Review>Vividly captures a year in the life of eastside Detroit's Engine Company 50.</Review>
            <Review>Burn does some eulogising for a great nation that may never achieve that greatness again, but it also celebrates the spirit of community that built it up.</Review>
            <Review>Burn, from directors Tom Putnam and Brenna Sanchez, is a straight-up documentary about a year in the life of the Detroit Fire Department. And what a year.</Review>
            <Review>As powerful as Burn's images can be, the Detroit firefighters tell their own stories about what's important to them, their neighborhood connections, their family legacies, their pride in their fellows and in their community.</Review>
            <Review>Directors Tom Putnam and Brenna Sanchez structure Burn in a brilliant way, allowing viewers not just access to life behind the fire hose but to make personal connections with these men who act against the human instinct to run away from the flames.</Review>
            <Review>... the dynamic on-the-fly scenes of danger and chummy stationhouse camaraderie are slowly peeled away to reveal a fascinating and multigenerational portrait of loss, resiliency, frustration and regret.</Review>
            <Review>If Black America is an internal colony, then Detroit is its epicenter. Hence, the more than coincidental ties between this powerful documentary and Pontecorvo's masterpiece.</Review>

            <Review>Growing old together can't be easy, but in this case, it's certainly beautiful.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director Michael McGowan covers all the bases here -- the long-standing romance between the aging couple, the hovering concerns of their son and daughter, the constant head-butting with the building inspector -- with well-paced confidence.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director Michael McGowan (Saint Ralph) shows affinity for the subtle undercurrents of a long, happy marriage, but the friction between Cromwell and the government bureaucracy stays one-note.</Review>
            <Review>Bring a handkerchief, or possibly a bedsheet, to "Still Mine"; this fact-based, beautifully acted drama could wring tears from a brick.</Review>
            <Review>[A] tough-minded tearjerker, based on a true story ...</Review>
            <Review>It is about a husband and wife, partners through six decades, grappling with issues of aging, and how to spend what time together remains with grace and dignity.</Review>
            <Review>[A] warmly detailed, emotionally accurate portrait of enduring love.</Review>
            <Review>Still Mine has romance, passion, suspense, and a David-and-Goliath narrative that may make you want to stand up and cheer.</Review>
            <Review>A bittersweet winner-driven by the strong performances and sharply observed nuances in both McGowan's script and direction.</Review>
            <Review>Still together, and still in love</Review>
            <Review>Written and directed with an uncommon straightforwardness...</Review>
            <Review>Lovely performances by Cromwell and Bujold, as well as those playing their extended family of children and friends, are understated yet truthful. And it's good to be reminded that love that withstands a lifetime is a most precious thing.</Review>

            <Review>Early scenes prove an exception to most of this genre du jour's tired rules, which makes it especially disappointing when the third act does little more than reinforce them.</Review>
            <Review>A nature-meets-nightmare tale that unfortunately gets lost in its own thicket of tricks.</Review>
            <Review>It all gets very artsy and weird in Act III (and I watched it twice) but hey, I'll take a bit of cerebral effort over just a bunch of door-slamming and bloodletting.</Review>
            <Review>There's a shred of an interesting idea in Mr. Jones, but the film is far too unfocused, sloppy, and downright dull to leave any kind of impact.</Review>
            <Review>No matter how creative its frames, Mr. Jones is [...] just an unimpressive stack of sticks and skulls.</Review>
            <Review>An imperfect horror film, but it's worth a look for its atmosphere, and valiant attempts at supernatural and meta-storytelling.</Review>
            <Review>That it half succeeds, in spite of its cloying self-seriousness, means that it's at best a convincing copycat of a definitive expression of ego and influence in art.</Review>
            <Review>In attempting to experiment with horror tropes and the found-footage format, director Karl Mueller tries too hard and walks away with a muddled, drastically uneven hodgepodge.</Review>

            <Review>This is a movie that so privileges the perspective of the good-looking foofy-haired white male that it makes you understand the absolutely pejorative aspect of the term "heteronormative."</Review>
            <Review>Lowell's considerable charm goes a long way toward filling in the gaps and the story's emphasis on self-discovery over romantic couplings supplies enough interest to sustain the brisk 80-minute running time.</Review>
            <Review>Gives us a story of love among 20-somethings without telling us enough about the main characters to indicate why we should care about their perfectly ordinary entanglements.</Review>
            <Review>Beware any movie that talks about what it is before being what it is.</Review>
            <Review>Straining to meld a love triangle with an astronomy lesson, the rom-com "The Brightest Star" disappears into a black hole of cliché.</Review>
            <Review>Far from burning bright, this earnest indie starts out dull and gets duller.</Review>
            <Review>The chief problem is that no matter what the nameless dude is up to, it hardly seems to matter.</Review>
            <Review>Shallow, contrived, toothless and ultimately forgettable.</Review>
            <Review>Notable for its effective performances and for the sincerity with which it tries to capture the confusion of young adulthood, but it often chooses simplicity over depth.</Review>
            <Review>Brightest Star is a dim boy-meets-girl relationship drama that is low on conflict and charm, despite a relatable premise and a strong young ensemble.</Review>
            <Review>For all the Hollywood obsession with high-concept and special effects, sometimes there's something enchanting about a simple story simply told, and a movie of small rather than grand gestures.</Review>
            <Review>Nicely acted coming-of-age story feels oddly dated and lacks resonance.</Review>

            <Review>"7 Boxes" is both a tense and frightening crime film as well as a sometimes-dreamy evocation of life in the sprawling underclass, its hallucinatory aspects, its chaos and violence, its fantasies.</Review>
            <Review>"7 Boxes," a low-budget Paraguayan crime caper goosed by low-rung dreams, crackles with the desperate energy of forced innovation.</Review>
            <Review>Sometimes it ventures into the realm of farse, but just then it returns to the comic book feel that it creates from the start. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>It reminded me of the best violent/funny Tarantino moments. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>

            <Review>The film encounters some genre cliches, but there are some nifty twists along the way, thanks in part to an expressive performance by newcomer Franco.</Review>
            <Review>Directors Juan Carlos Maneglia and Tana Schembori, who also co-wrote the screenplay, keep the action organic, but 7 Boxes is bookended with a couple of stylistic scenes.</Review>

            <Review>In general, the film feels like all setup and no punch line.</Review>
            <Review>Even when bits go thud, there's a brittle, unsentimental wit about kin's inexplicable tug that's hard to ignore, and the leads - game for some surprisingly sublime bits of physical comedy - eventually wear one's anti-charm defenses down.</Review>
            <Review>The interactions of the two leads are like a finger hitting a single piano note for 90 minutes.</Review>
            <Review>Despite some promise, so much is left unexplained or unpacked and it fails to deliver.</Review>
            <Review>... manages an effective mix of slapstick and sentiment that can't quite sustain itself at feature length.</Review>
            <Review>While this sibling comedy makes some sharp observations about the push and pull of family relationships, it's also one of those deliberately wacky movies that wears us out with nonstop gags that are utterly unconvincing.</Review>
            <Review>Rennie and Pumphrey are both engaging, funny actors, but the relentless aggro-idiocy between them will probably only appeal to other twenty-something dudes who behave like sixth-graders.</Review>
            <Review>Delivers a steady stream of laughs and an accurate depiction of sibling rivalry, contributing to a funny, freewheeling effort that's missing focus, but finds an unusual personality of its own.</Review>

        <Duration>96</Duration>
        <StoryLine>The Jewish Cardinal tells the amazing true story of Jean-Marie Lustiger, the son of Polish-Jewish immigrants, who maintained his cultural identity as a Jew even after converting to Catholicism at a young age, and later joining the priesthood. Quickly rising within the ranks of the Church, Lustiger was appointed Archbishop of Paris by Pope Jean Paul II - and found a new platform to celebrate his dual identity as a Catholic Jew, earning him both friends and enemies from either group. When Carmelite nuns settle down to build a convent within the cursed walls of Auschwitz, Lustiger finds himself a mediator between the two communities - and may be forced at last to choose his side.

            <Review>An enjoyable if standard bio-docu that gives equal weight to Mercedes Sosa's voice, life and politics.</Review>
            <Review>Suffers from its overly insular and hagiographic perspective, but in its best moments it well illustrates the reasons for her musical influence and social importance.</Review>
            <Review>The lack of background information and connective tissue makes the film feel incomplete.</Review>
            <Review>To many she was a saint, but there's only so much adoration one can take before longing for a more down-to-earth perspective.</Review>
            <Review>Alas, all [the] film can do to make its case for Sosa's significance is trot out subjects who compare her to Joan Baez, Ella Fitzgerald, and, most puzzlingly, "Mick Jagger and Paul McCartney in one," without elaboration.</Review>
            <Review>But if a certain sentimentality means that there is a little too much included, the film also benefits from the obvious emotion that the contributors all pour into it.</Review>
            <Review>[T]he documentary succeeds in conveying not just the bare facts of her life, but something of her magic, both to longtime fans and to those less familiar with her work.</Review>
            <Review>A genuinely heartfelt, adequately informative introduction to the life and music of Mercedes Sosa.</Review>
            <Review>The artistic achievements and personal torments of one of Latin America's greatest vocal artists and the conscience of her continent.</Review>
            <Review>Rodrigo H. Vila's documentary...is a deeply loving portrait, with a leisurely pace that proves quite rewarding, as it encourages a rich immersion in the music and persona of its great subject.</Review>

        <Title>The Strange Woman</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 1946</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>100</Duration>
        <StoryLine>B-movie auteur Edgar G. Ulmer managed to direct a few A-pictures during his long career; he was personally selected by Hedy Lamarr to helm this big-budget thriller, a project she put together to change her image as a starlet whose sex appeal outweighed her acting abilities. Set in the early 19th century, The Strange Woman takes place in Bangor, Maine, where logging and lumber mills have made the town prosperous. Jenny Hager (Lamarr) has grown up in Bangor, not far from the watchful eye of wealthy Isaiah Poster (Gene Lockhart). The fact that Jenny is twenty years Isaiah's junior does not stem his amorous intentions, and when she's finally out of her teens, Jenny accepts his proposal of marriage. But beneath her sweet exterior, Jenny is a shrewd, conniving women, and while she makes a fine life for herself with Isaiah's money, she obviously doesn't care for him. When Isaiah's son Ephraim (Louis Hayward) visits from college, Jenny is immediately attracted to him, and she tells him that she'll marry him if he murders his father. But, unknown to Ephraim, Jenny is already scheming to win the affections of businessman John Evered (George Sanders), even though he's pledged to marry her best friend Meg (Hillary Brooke). Based on a novel by Ben Ames Williams, The Strange Woman was generally considered one of Hedy Lamarr's best performances, although her best-known performance would continue to be in Ecstasy (1933), largely because of her then-daring nude scenes.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Only those scared of being bored to death need fear "Locker 13," an omnibus of horror stories that could hardly be more tame, talky and tepid, both individually and as a whole.</Review>
            <Review>While the finale at least puts the notion of an evil locker to some practical use, it might have been better if the filmmakers simply stored all the copies of "Locker 13" inside the haunted contraption and threw away the key.</Review>
            <Review>An alternately creaky and intriguing ride, one of earnest ambition and dashed potential.</Review>
            <Review>The transition from comedy to horror (and back) never fully gels, and nobody seems "on the trolley" with the period jargon.</Review>
            <Review>As a die-hard fan of the horror anthology film, I take no pleasure in stating that Locker 13's few stray glimmers of quality are not worth the slog it takes to find them.</Review>
            <Review>Locker 13 isn't a film so much as a dire symptom of a culture in which the ability to fund a movie has become reason enough to make one.</Review>
            <Review>Despite boasting five directors, eight writers and more than a dozen producers, Locker 13 - partially financed with a Kickstarter campaign - hangs together better than many anthology pictures.</Review>

            <Review>A blandly executed action-thriller whose cast names (Matt Dillon, Willem Dafoe) and mild '80s Louisiana flavor offer only modest compensations for the story's workmanlike construction and routine twists.</Review>
            <Review>[A] thoroughly routine, straight-to-video-reminiscent action thriller set in Louisiana.</Review>
            <Review>Action fans need more than bullets and bodies. "Bad Country" is a disappointment.</Review>
            <Review>True to its name, Bad Country falls short on almost every count, but it's not just bad - it's also lazy, lifeless and guilty of squandering many fine actors.</Review>

            <Review>The result is awkward, hyped propaganda for faith-based initiatives and against abortion.</Review>
            <Review>What remains is a poor man's Precious, with all the earlier film's go-for-broke melodrama but none of its weirdness or empathy for the impoverished.</Review>
            <Review>An after-school special blown up on the big screen, it stridently aims to inspire you. More likely, it'll make you cringe.</Review>
            <Review>Hudgens captures both the defiance and fear of a girl at this crossroads. Her performance elevates what's often a trite and heavy-handed script.</Review>
            <Review>The kind of film that outfits a potentially compelling story with politically convenient signposts - not understanding that sometimes, getting out of the way of a good tale is the best kind of polemical strategy.</Review>
            <Review>It is the galvanizing force of Vanessa Hudgens who catapults Gimme Shelter above the heartbreaking level of soap opera with a lancing effect.</Review>
            <Review>Gimme Shelter is an example of a faith-based, pro-life film done right.</Review>
            <Review>Gimme Shelter plays more like a Lifetime movie or after school special.</Review>
            <Review>The film's complicating force and conflict undeniably real, its thrust is defeated by clichéd treatment and uninspired performances.</Review>
            <Review>It's the kind of movie that touts itself as 'inspirational,' and it feels like a made-for-TV melodrama.</Review>
            <Review>Vanessa Hudgens proves that she's a versatile, grown-up performer in 'Gimme Shelter,' an unsettling look at a pregnant teenager who seems to have nowhere to run.</Review>
            <Review>There's a whole [other] film to be made [...]-one driven less by hysterics and villainous mother figures, and more by examples of how charity and compassion can turn dead ends into doorways-but Gimme Shelter doesn't seem to want to make it.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>131</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Virgil Oldman is a solitary, cultured man whose reluctance to engage with others, especially women, is matched only by the dogged obsessiveness with which he practices his profession of antiques dealer. He's never been close to another human being, not even Robert, his only friend - a young, skillful restorer of mechanical devices from every era. The day he turns sixty-three, Virgil receives a phone call from a young woman who asks him to handle the disposal of some family works of art. But when the time comes for his first site visit, the girl fails to appear, nor, for various reasons, is she present for the taking of the inventory or for the transportation and restoration of the pieces. More than once Virgil is tempted to bow out of what appears to be nothing but a bothersome mess, but on each occasion, the mysterious young woman, locked in her own obsessional world, convinces him to continue. And with this, the old antique dealer's life begins to take an unexpected turn. It is Robert who shows him, step-by-step, how to win the heart of a young woman who is afraid of the world and, caught in the middle of this puzzling game of chess, Virgil soon finds himself enveloped by a passion that will transform his grey existence forever.

            <Review>The movie's an eyeful, though, thanks to the intricate production design and many artworks on display; it's also an earful, thanks to Ennio Morricone's fittingly lush score.</Review>
            <Review>"The Best Offer" is at its best when it's decidedly weird.</Review>
            <Review>An uneven but weirdly mesmerizing drama/thriller, Giuseppe Tornatore's "The Best Offer" offers an acting showcase to Geoffrey Rush.</Review>
            <Review>Italian writer-director Giuseppe Tornatore... designs beautiful sets around Virgil, who holds the screen in nearly every shot.</Review>
            <Review>The film has several smart twists and surprises up its well-tailored sleeve.</Review>
            <Review>If its destination is patently obvious from the outset, the journey does at least offer scattered pleasures.</Review>
            <Review>Tornatore lays on the symbolism a bit thickly, and the film's mix of accents offers a distinct whiff of Europudding. You will probably even see some of the twists coming. Yet the film is still terrifically compelling.</Review>
            <Review>Part of a forger's craft involves not simply duplicating the images but replicating the strokes to be found in the original. Tornatore's film makes deft use of cinematic cliché to lead viewers astray.</Review>
            <Review>In The Best Offer, director/writer Giuseppe Tornatore feasts at the Hitchcock table.</Review>
            <Review>When all is revealed in "The Best Offer," the appropriate reaction is that of a frustrated auctioneer: "That's it? That's all you've got?"</Review>
            <Review>The clues and themes laid out early on in The Best Offer, which evolve into heavy handedness in their own right, also lay unencumbered paths for obvious twists to come in this limp arthouse thriller.</Review>

            <Review>Definitely a great stunt, but you spend the film thinking how much more the "Jackass"/"Bad Grandpa" crew could have done with a premise like this.</Review>
            <Review>It feels much like a theme park itself -- really exciting at first, but then your senses are dulled, and eventually you just want to go.</Review>
            <Review>Suggests an R-rated Twilight Zone episode with a twist of Fellini-lite, in a trite film school kind of way.</Review>
            <Review>It's really just a middling fantasy about a middle-aged dad having a meltdown during a family vacation to the Magic Kingdom, with a few scattered sci-fi and horror elements thrown in.</Review>
            <Review>The effects-heavy movie flies off into exotic yet inconsequential science-fiction visions; Moore's view of the macabre in the banal is a tepid successor to David Lynch's.</Review>
            <Review>[A] creepy, inventive, nearly successful little movie ...</Review>
            <Review>As a conversation piece for hardcore film buffs and Disney fans, it's a fascinating little curiosity -- but that's about it.</Review>
            <Review>An incredible feat of satirical culture-jamming and gonzo movie-making, Escape from Tomorrow, for better or worse, won't be forgotten by those who agree to buy the ticket and take the ride</Review>
            <Review>Anyone with a filmmaking background should watch the movie to see what real guerrilla filmmaking can accomplish.</Review>
            <Review>Whatever the technical intrigue of a film shot guerilla-style at Disney World, the would-be surreal midlife crisis that ended up onscreen doesn't work... at all.</Review>
            <Review>Semi-surreal science fiction complications, botched horror and bad, flat acting erupt, as well as dad's perverse and lecherous desire for two underaged French girls.</Review>

            <Review>The dialogue isn't dubbed, but is written and delivered so indifferently that it might as well have been.</Review>
            <Review>[Other "Hercules" movies] at least nodded at classical mythology. Harlin's boasts a Hercules in name chiefly and banks on moviegoers' ignorance.</Review>
            <Review>It delivers what it promises, which is muscular guys in skimpy clothes fighting and howling, as well as some large-scale digitally enhanced battle sequences.</Review>
            <Review>The Legend of Hercules may not track, but Harlin still knows how to set up a rousing circus.</Review>
            <Review>The whole thing is a total bore.</Review>
            <Review>This film should be removed from theaters as soon as possible to avoid damaging the brains of people who have the misfortune of seeing it.</Review>
            <Review>Lunkhead Kellan Lutz is the demigod's density in Renny Harlin's 300-lite, MST3K-ready retelling of the classical legend. Think Jesus with muscles, by the power of Greyskull.</Review>
            <Review>There's nothing here to engage the viewer or make them care one iota about what's occurring on the screen, making it no wonder that this got dumped into theaters in the middle of January.</Review>
            <Review>The film opens on a huge battle in the Greek city of Argos, but it often ends up feeling like the director bought it cheap at the high street namesake.</Review>
            <Review>Even dental extraction is more enjoyable to endure than this artistically bankrupt misfire.</Review>
            <Review>No one seems to have high hopes for it - though it might well help to pass a wet afternoon when it shows up on Netflix 15 minutes from now.</Review>

            <Review>It follows a search for personal salvation while painting a portrait of Laotian life that's both revealing and relatable.</Review>
            <Review>A powerful, deeply moving drama about a young boy who comes to terms with the tragedies that have befallen his family by creating a thing of beauty - a gorgeous, high-flying rocket emitting triumphant bursts of color - out of refuse left by the war.</Review>
            <Review>Mordaunt doesn't always succeed at balancing the sentimental, the political and the ethnographic, but at its strongest the story is a seamless melding of history's dark undertow and a child's indefatigable optimism.</Review>
            <Review>Long on atmosphere and less sentimental about poverty than "Beasts of the Southern Wild," the film carries a potent charge of authenticity.</Review>
            <Review>A pretty, somewhat sleepy and finally strange once-upon-a-time tale...</Review>
            <Review>If the Laotians in the film appear to be superstitious simpletons, it's not because they actually are - it's because Mr. Mordaunt made them so.</Review>

            <Review>The movie's found-footage conceit never creates a proper atmosphere, something essential to any horror film but particularly one involving the occult.</Review>
            <Review>Throw in an abandoned house in the neighborhood that is suddenly occupied, a vanishing obstetrician and a first communion ceremony that goes terribly wrong, and the chill factor quickly rises.</Review>
            <Review>A disjointed and unconvincing movie that is also embarrassingly derivative of "Paranormal Activity."</Review>
            <Review>Dredging up horror movie favorites like random nosebleeds, a traumatized priest and a mama-to-be with a yen for raw meat, Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett direct with competence but a dispiriting lack of originality.</Review>
            <Review>At least there's a credible premise in "Devil's Due," an otherwise feeble exercise in the found-footage form.</Review>
            <Review>The feature-length debut of two thirds of the directorial troupe Radio Silence scrambles to find any excuse to cut to a new angle or shoot traditional coverage while debasing a potentially compelling story with every found-footage cliché in the book.</Review>
            <Review>For the most part, Devil's Due unfolds more like a scripted reality series than a horrifying tale.</Review>
            <Review>Devil's Due, the latest from the filmmaking team known as Radio Silence, is a perfectly serviceable horror movie with some rather neat mythology that unfortunately gets lost in the trappings of its own storytelling format.</Review>
            <Review>Virtually a found footage remake of Rosemary's Baby, but it's a pretty fun version of that.</Review>
            <Review>'Devil's Due' is pretty much a found-footage version of the classic 1968 Roman Polanski movie 'Rosemary's Baby.'</Review>
            <Review>A better-than-average found-footage thriller...</Review>
            <Review>Downplays its Christian concerns until the religious overtones become undertones. Instead, the writer and directors embrace the domestic drama at its core.</Review>

            <Review>"The Selfish Giant" is a story of dependence, damage and desperation, told with grit and grimy frankness. It's also a portrait of friendship born of need and emptiness, on the road to nowhere.</Review>
            <Review>Clio Barnard's The Selfish Giant isn't the Oscar Wilde children's story, but more an inspired take on it in the kitchen-sink style of a Ken Loach drama.</Review>

            <Review>The Selfish Giant is a film of such power and beauty that there will be no escaping it -- so long as you go to see it in the first place.</Review>
            <Review>Barnard bolsters this central friendship and subsequent unwitting rivalry with myriad background details to flesh out their world and expose how dire circumstances are.</Review>
            <Review>Though they share the same title, director Clio Barnard's bewitching follow-up to The Arbor bears little cosmetic similarity to the fluorescent idyll of Oscar Wilde's 19th century children's fable.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director Clio Barnard directs with ferocious maturity, galvanising "scrap" pieces of everyday life into a wonderfully cinematic whole.</Review>
            <Review>Barnard's film is charged with the same compassion and lyricism. It is one of those desperately sad and dispiriting films that one would prefer to forget but probably never will.</Review>
            <Review>There is a plot (adapted from Oscar Wilde's famous short story of the same name), and it's a good one, but ... most important are Arbor and Swifty, played to pure perfection by little Connor Chapman and big Shaun Thomas.</Review>
            <Review>The Selfish Giant is one of the best films of the year: captivating, often funny, and filled with the most naturalistic performances you're likely to see.</Review>

        <Title>The Easy Life (Il sorpasso)</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 1961</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>103</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Regarded by many as Dino Risi's finest film, The Easy Life (Il Sorpasso) casts Vittorio Gassman as Bruno, a jaded, aging roue, who introduces young Roberto Mariani Jean-Louis Trintignant to his hedonistic lifestyle.. Previously a man with a purpose in life, Roberto soon becomes as wanton and wastrelly as Bruno. The older man is proud of his handiwork--until tragedy strikes. Risi sagaciously sets his moral fable against the beauties of the Riviera; we may not approve of Bruno's lifestyle, but we certainly understand why it appeals to him. Among the screenwriters of The Easy Life was Ettora Scola, a frequent Dino Risi and Vittorio de Sica collaborator and an excellent director in his own right.</StoryLine>

            <Review>We don't make movies in America like Gloria, so we have to import them. I wish we'd import more -- and make a few, as well.</Review>
            <Review>Whether you appreciate Gloria as a portrait of a vital woman, muddling through life's middle chapters, or as an allegory of Chilean resilience, the message is the same: Let's face the music and dance.</Review>
            <Review>It's an open-ended question whether Gloria ever finds the happiness she seeks while dodging the current of middle-aged isolation, but her constant search is a valiant and deeply involving one.</Review>
            <Review>Chilean actress Paulina Garcia's performance in "Gloria" is simply flabbergasting.</Review>
            <Review>Not quite a comedy and not quite a drama, this Chilean film looks at middle age from a refreshingly even-handed perspective, not a wacky or tragic one.</Review>
            <Review>The film belongs to Garcia, who is in literally every shot. Wafting over Garcia's face at different moments are contentment, frustration, loneliness, disappointment, happiness.</Review>
            <Review>What truly makes the film riveting is Paulina García's performance as the title character -- and she appears in nearly every shot. With a wide, truly contagious smile, García exudes a lived-in confidence and control with every movement.</Review>
            <Review>One of the best Chilean films of the 21st century. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Lelio fulfills its purpose after making his protagonist fight and then rewarding her with the contradiction of her desire for a great escape. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>The film's pulse comes in many ways from García's brave and beautiful central performance.</Review>
            <Review>The film is a showcase for García's rich and varied performance. When it comes to finding meaning in Gloria's story, though, Lelio leaves that up to us.</Review>
            <Review>You can't help but like Gloria. Her life isn't easy, but you don't feel sorry for her.</Review>

            <Review>When the movie veers away from the verbal gymnastics of a bunch of colorful dopes out-dumbing one another and into overindulged farce, the specificity of the Coens' writing begins to fade.</Review>
            <Review>This nominal remake of the 1966 art caper that starred Michael Caine and Shirley MacLaine has all the fizz of flat soda ...</Review>
            <Review>"Gambit" is a trans-Atlantic delivery of "meh."</Review>
            <Review>Firth is solid as always. He fits his tailored suits and rectangular glasses to a T. Diaz fares less well.</Review>
            <Review>'Gambit' is like drinking cheap, warm champagne from a plastic cup.</Review>
            <Review>Even with a script by the Coen brothers, and a classy international cast led by Colin Firth, this contemporary London caper movie falls far short of its potential even as a lightweight comic romp.</Review>
            <Review>It feels like a film that's been cut down along the way in an attempt at commercial salvation.</Review>
            <Review>Colin Firth is decidedly much better than the role and the lines he's given.</Review>
            <Review>So-so remake of '60s caper has slapstick, brief nudity.</Review>
            <Review>... feels like a first draft of a dusty script that was pulled from the bottom of a drawer without being polished prior to production.</Review>
            <Review>Firth and Diaz, game as they are, look lost and disappointed most of the time during Gambit, as though they pictured themselves making Burn After Reading, and instead found themselves in The Ladykillers.</Review>
            <Review>The director behind Soapdish and The Last Station is generally reliable, but he can't keep up with the Coens' fast paced dialogue.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Stranded in the African wilds by a plane crash, a disparate group of passengers' worst enemy isn't weather or wild animals but a fellow traveler. A delayed flight causes several South African travelers to charter a small plane from unctuous pilot Sturdevan (Nigel Davenport). Among the group: Dr. Bondrachai (Theodore Bikel), divorcee Grace Munkton (Susannah York), the crooked Brian O'Brien (Stuart Whitman), the elderly German Grimmelman (Harry Andrews), and mining engineer Mike Bain (Stanley Baker). O'Brien bribes Sturdevan to reroute the flight, so when the plane is brought down in the vast Kalahari by an encounter with a cloud of locusts, no rescue can be expected. A struggle for control begins. After Studevan attacks Grace sexually, he is exiled, and Brian takes over. He attempts to banish Bondrachai and Grimmelman, but the latter objects, and Brian kills him. Only Grace and Mike are left to deal with Brian, but when they think they've got the best of him, he manages to stay alive and stalk them to plot his revenge. Vicious local baboons have a surprise for the increasingly deranged Brian, however-they are hunting the hunter. The film re-teams star/co-producer Baker with his Zulu (1964) writer/director Cy Endfield. ~ Karl Williams, Rovi</StoryLine>

May also stars as Henrietta, a shy and clumsy wallflower, who is also heir to a large pile of money. Indigent playboy Graham (Walter Matthau), who has squandered his inherited trust fund and needs to get a new source of money, begins to ply his affections upon Henrietta. When his butler (George Rose) recommends that Graham should marry Henrietta and gain control of her funds, Graham borrows money from his miserable uncle (James Coco) and wines and dines Henrietta. Graham's dastardly plan is to marry Henrietta, take her off on a trip to the mountains, and murder her. Graham can then return from her funeral and inherit his wealth. But thrown into his path toward the perfect murder are a collection of Henrietta's loyal -- and not so loyal -- retainers and the small dim light of Graham's own conscience.</StoryLine>

Growing up in small town Georgia, Trey Cole (Austin Stowell) never had it easy. The moment he was old enough to chase his dreams of becoming a country singer, he spread his wings and flew away. As Trey's fame skyrocketed, however, his family struggled with death and hardship. Years later, Trey is at the height of fame when he finally realizes it's time for a trip back home. Upon returning home, his first instinct is to drop by the local barbershop for a visit with Charlie Shuffleton (Danny Glover), the kindly coiffeur who treated Trey like a son in those trying times. Upon learning that he is too late to connect with Charlie, the dejected Trey realizes that reconnecting with his family would be the best way to honor his friend's memory. Unfortunately for Trey, it isn't going to be easy, because he wasn't there when his struggling sister needed him the most.

        <ReleaseDate/>
        <Duration>70</Duration>
        <StoryLine>THE HOOPING LIFE is the first film that captures the origins and rise of modern day hula-hooping - a.k.a hooping. With an introduction and narration by hooper (of basketball and hulaalike) Shaquille O'Neal, the film illuminates eight extraordinary stories of hoop devotees who have embraced it as an art form, a teaching aid, and even an instrument of redemption. From the streets, to intimate clubs, to giant arenas, the film alternates between self-filmed video diaries, verit� documentary footage, and spectacularly filmed performances. Filmed over six years, and featuring an appearance by late hoop-promoter and TV personality Art Linkletter, the film celebrates the healing power of movement and the spirit of human inventiveness.

        <StoryLine>Ottoman Empire Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror plots to conquer Constantinople and bring about the downfall of the Roman Empire in this historical epic from director Faruk Aksoy (Yesil Isik). For 1,500 year the Roman Empire has flourished. Though many have tried to invade the Byzantine fortress, the massive walls protecting the city have made it virtually impenetrable. Ascending to the Ottoman throne following the death of his powerful father, 19-year-old Fatih Mehmet vows to succeed where all others have failed. Over the course of the next two years, Fatih plans his elaborate invasion as astute Emperor Constantine assembles a powerful league of allies to defend the Imperial city. Later, on the night of April 1st, 1453, the citizens of Constantinople fill the streets to celebrate Easter as Fatih leads an army of thousands right to the city gates. Before the sun rises the following day, a new chapter of history will be written, and a new empire born.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Conquest 1453 is a muddled pool of hypocrisy. While it feeds on the common paranoia of seeing the West as an unwelcoming and disreputable crowd, it reinforces our collective consciousness' aspirations for superiority in two very contradictory ways</Review>

        <Title>Bettie Page Reveals All</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>101</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Academy Award-nominated filmmaker Mark Mori's BETTIE PAGE REVEALS ALL is an intimate look at one of the world's most recognized sex symbols, told in her own words for the first time. In Mori's alluring documentary, the real Bettie Page emerges from the veil of myth and rumor via audio interviews taped a decade prior to her death in 2008. With earthy, razor sharp wit, Bettie tells her life story -- from humble beginnings as one of six children in an impoverished southern family, to high school salutatorian, to scandalous 50s pin-up model, to shocking retirement in 1957 at the peak of her modeling career. Sharing rare details about her short-lived first marriage and many torrid affairs, this keen insider's glimpse follows Bettie through decades of broken marriages, born-again Christianity, and bouts of mental illness, before her ultimate return to the public eye in the early 90's, unaware of her cult status. Ranked by Forbes in 2012 as one of the top ten posthumous celebrity earners, Bettie and her enduring legacy continue to flourish. (c) Music Box Films</StoryLine>

            <Review>Page's natural beauty, charisma and genuine sense of fun - not to mention her 36-24-37 measurements - come clearly through in Mori's tale.</Review>
            <Review>An amateurish and oddly paced documentary, "Bettie Page Reveals All" nonetheless turns out to be revealing, if perhaps not in the way its makers intended.</Review>
            <Review>The best thing about this documentary portrait of the beloved 1950s pin-up is its meaty narration, courtesy of Page herself, speaking in the low, slightly gravelly register of an aging Southern belle.</Review>
            <Review>The film offers frank, matter-of-fact commentary that is far more illuminating than the talking-head encomiums served up by the likes of Perez Hilton, Dita Von Teese, and Hugh Hefner.</Review>
            <Review>The film's reason for being, though, is the sound of Page's voice -- a worldly, aged Southern drawl -- as she recounts her life story from childhood through retirement.</Review>
            <Review>A scintillating, sincere and empathetic portrait of the pinup queen who attained her greatest influence as an icon of female sexuality decades after she retired.</Review>
            <Review>A shoddily made, amateur-hour barrage of chintzy music, stock footage and flashy video effects that were presumably state of the art during the Reagan administration.</Review>
            <Review>Bettie Page Reveals All is an excellent amalgamation of the history of Page and her incredible impact on modeling and fashion, mostly told in her own voice.</Review>
            <Review>Mori hammers home her status as a pop culture icon to a numbing degree, perhaps because parts of Bettie's spotty narration gloss over huge chunks of her life while other portions reduce what might otherwise seem fascinating to one-dimensional levels.</Review>
            <Review>Revealing it is on so many levels. It is also stunning, an exquisite amalgam of vintage film footage and photos from Page's glory days and interviews with Page and friends, family members and experts in the field of voyeurism.</Review>
            <Review>It seems relatively innocent, but such antics were once shocking.</Review>
            <Review>A spanking good date movie, with the right date, of course.</Review>

            <Review>A suspenseful, violent horror film that touches on the inner lives of sexual predators, the question of guilt and remorse in the human soul, and the practice of torture.</Review>
            <Review>Unpredictable, with a twisted surprise around each corner, Big Bad Wolves is a clever and arresting shocker.</Review>
            <Review>There's little to the movie other than shocks and gross-outs.</Review>
            <Review>It is an intriguing film with much to admire, but it doesn't always earn its pitch-black attempts at humor.</Review>
            <Review>Tarantino-aping hasn't died out entirely; it's just moved to Israel.</Review>
            <Review>While Big Bad Wolves delivers the Hostel-like torture jolts with ruthless precision, the movie is also a rudely funny satire of a macho, paranoid culture where the protection of children is used to justify any conduct.</Review>
            <Review>The problem that comes with Big Bad Wolves is that its excessive violence is too intrinsically tied to questions of morality to simply create excuses of "it's just entertainment."</Review>
            <Review>At moments it's fun to watch the psychological drama unfold, and Grad is especially good as the vengeful father, but much of the movie is stomach-churning and visually flat.</Review>
            <Review>A dark, captivating, and thoroughly fascinating piece of genre filmmaking.</Review>
            <Review>As dark comedies go, this is about as dark as it gets. The acting and stunt work are very solid. I can't say I enjoyed this, but the film is thought-provoking, occasionally funny, and it does raise some interesting moral questions.</Review>
            <Review>A grisly off-beat moralistic Israeli thriller about a suspected serial rapist killer being tortured by a cop and the victim's father.</Review>
            <Review>We've seen this film before - as recently as in last year's Prisoners - but Big Bad Wolves still manages to feel fresh.</Review>

        <StoryLine>A contented mall cop sustains a debilitating injury in his effort to capture a fleeing thief, but begins entertaining the idea of robbing the mall after growing frustrated in his search for a new job. Frank's job at the Town Center Mall was an easy one until the day a thief broke into one of the department stores. In his efforts to apprehend the intruder as he smashes through a plate glass window, Frank loses his arm at the elbow. Six months later, Frank has lost his job as a result of his injury. As the job rejection letters start to pile up, a nostalgic Frank pays a visit to the mall, and meets his two replacements - an ex-punk rocker named Donna and a lazy public access television personality named White Wedding. In time Frank and Donna forge something of a romantic bond that is strengthened by Frank's willingness to open up about his injury and resulting job search. But later, as a plucky record store employee sets her romantic sights on Donna, the increasingly embittered Frank grows desperate for cash, and starts to wonder if he, too, might be able to rob the mall and get away with it.</StoryLine>

            <Review>The gradual revelation that there's more to Daisy than meets the eye is no great surprise, but it does at least negate - too late! - some of the more troubling subtext.</Review>
            <Review>It's all thoroughly, intentionally lightweight, and the film's final 10 minutes is a rush of highly unlikely smiley face resolutions. Still, Wood somehow makes it work as well as it can.</Review>
            <Review>He's a rebellious trust-funder who specializes in strip clubs, one-night stands and gambling debts. She's a possibly schizophrenic mental patient raised in near-captivity by an abusive mother. How could these two kids not fall in love?</Review>
            <Review>Scott Speedman and Evan Rachel Wood would have been better off doing a YouTube video together where they simply make goo-goo eyes at one another than co-starring in a featherweight trifle like "Barefoot".</Review>
            <Review>Really, the emotionally ill have enough stigmas to contend with. They don't need the patronizing-yet-popular movie one of "They're just like us - only, you know, more innocent."</Review>
            <Review>A sorry throwback to sentimental 1960s movies -- the ones in which an offbeat woman repairs the soul of an emotionally clueless man.</Review>
            <Review>Romantic dramedy is touching but shallow; mature themes.</Review>
            <Review>Barefoot follows an expected Pretty Woman-esque path, but it's quite charming along the way, and the oddball premise helps it feel fresh.</Review>
            <Review>There was once a time when director Andrew Fleming made fantastic films.</Review>
            <Review>A soggy mess, one that takes a thoroughly simplistic look at mental illness and the people who suffer from it, delivering instead a romance and a road trip that are entirely unrealistic.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately, Daisy is revealed to be sane, but she's still emotionally and socially stunted [...] and the romantic relationship that gradually blossoms between her and Jay feels disturbingly pedophilic.</Review>
            <Review>It's an amalgam of tried-and-true themes minus any originality.</Review>

            <Review>"La Maison de la Radio" gives us the pleasant experience of hanging out with people who truly love their work.</Review>
            <Review>This might just be the ultimate cine-snob movie: a documentary about French public broadcasting.</Review>
            <Review>It's a film for Francophiles of the deepest dye, a grand tour of French culture and preoccupations.</Review>
            <Review>Access does not guarantee insight.</Review>
            <Review>As Mr. Philibert continues to pop in and out of different studios, in and out of the building, flitting from one face to the other, it feels as if he were searching for a story that never emerges.</Review>
            <Review>Given only hints of personalities and the thinnest strands of stories, we're left with a hum of tinny snippets instead of anything that resembles the glorious noise of people putting on show after show after show.</Review>
            <Review>There's a rhythm to Philibert's work, a tangible linearity - as he knows how to take every day life and illuminate it, find the subtleties, the nuances for us to appreciate and to resonate with.</Review>
            <Review>Behind it all lies the sense that here is something worth preserving, a celebration of radio's unique conversational appeal, a unifying force in times of splintered televisuality.</Review>
            <Review>[Documentary maker Nicolas Philibert's] admiration for Radio France's work and public-service ethos is self-evident, but this is a very hard film for a non-French audience to engage with.</Review>
            <Review>Looking at La Maison de la Radio in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo crisis, what strikes you is how conventional and white French state radio seems.</Review>
            <Review>Superb camerawork ably captures the energy of the diverse activities taking place within this distinctive circular building ... but it's the wonderful sound mix that best conveys the immediacy and intimacy that makes radio so unique.</Review>
            <Review>A pleasant, undemanding, rather Wiseman-lite study of a day in the life of Radio France, with all its producers, announcers, editors and tech people placidly busying themselves about their work.</Review>

        <Duration>90</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Joel Allen Schroeder's documentary Dear Mr. Watterson: An Exploration of Calvin &amp; Hobbes introduces us to numerous people who were profoundly influenced by the philosophical and very warmhearted comic strip created and written by Bill Watterson, who has studiously avoided the spotlight since ending the strip in 1995. Nearly two decades later, the film showcases how the collected works of Watterson still speak to readers everywhere. ~ Perry Seibert, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>Everything you'd expect from a crowd-sourced documentary, designed to celebrate its subject, while mostly just validating the aesthetic taste of its backers.</Review>
            <Review>An hour and a half of hero worship, basically. Fine by me.</Review>
            <Review>It was one of the greats of the now-nearly-defunct Sunday funnies, no doubt. Unfortunately, there's not much cinematic magic in watching the director reading the strip, or hearing various other enthusiasts talk about how much they loved it.</Review>
            <Review>If you're a fan of Calvin and Hobbes, director Joel Allen Schroeder's documentary Dear Mr. Watterson is more or less pure joy.</Review>
            <Review>If nothing else, it's a pleasant reminder that if you haven't taken those Calvin &amp; Hobbes anthologies off the shelf in a while, maybe it's time to go exploring again.</Review>
            <Review>At one point, someone marvels at Calvin's sheer "lust for life," and while Mr. Schroeder, no doubt, has a parallel fascination with his favorite comic strip, the film doesn't follow through.</Review>
            <Review>This is an appreciation steeped in nostalgia, something for fans of the strip to sit back and simply enjoy.</Review>
            <Review>A very worthwhile address of the art and industry of comic strips as a whole. Schroeder has a great appreciation for what his expert interviewees have to say.</Review>
            <Review>A charming look at the world of Calvin and Hobbes.</Review>
            <Review>A big-hearted but overly fawning documentary that -- despite some great interview material -- feel like a soggy toss-off, and missed opportunity.</Review>
            <Review>You may not learn anything from this mild, unremarkable film, but you might be tempted to order the deluxe, four-volume "The Complete Calvin and Hobbes" after watching it.</Review>
            <Review>An affectionate and personable look at the effect of one man's work on others that doesn't say much beyond that.</Review>

            <Review>As with the best stories, "The Trials of Muhammad Ali" puts one man's story within a greater context. This is Ali's story, but it's America's story, too. Here, it's well told.</Review>
            <Review>The Trials of Muhammad Ali allows us a chance to see Muhammad Ali not as an icon but as a man willing to take a stand, even an unpopular one, for something that he believed in.</Review>
            <Review>Conventional yet fascinating.</Review>
            <Review>Ali's life has been recounted so many times that you'd think no one could come up with a fresh angle on it; documentary maker Bill Siegel succeeds, primarily by delving into the religious story, largely downplayed by the mainstream.</Review>
            <Review>If you have fond memories of David Susskind's talk shows from the golden age of 1960s television, prepare to have them blasted away by this revealing documentary.</Review>
            <Review>There is history as it's remembered, and then there's history as it happened. This documentary gives us the latter, and it's a true education.</Review>
            <Review>A maddeningly incomplete portrait of the champ on the defensive, where he was never at his best.</Review>
            <Review>It's hard to go wrong with footage of the charismatic and abrasive Ali who is not always depicted as a saint</Review>
            <Review>Works better as a history of events than a biographical film about Ali.</Review>
            <Review>A rock-solid portrait of Ali's passions about faith and conscience, and a stirring case that his political legacy is more important, and will be more lasting, than his days in the boxing ring.</Review>
            <Review>Where it finds strength is in its exploration of Ali as a man and as a symbol.</Review>
            <Review>With athletes in 2013 giving in to everything around them, Ali's strength feels even more palpable. He truly was the greatest.</Review>

            <Review>Despite its inner conflict, Confession of Murder weaves a suspenseful, compelling tale that saves its surprises until the very end.</Review>
            <Review>With dark, compelling components similar to that of The Chaser and Memories of Murder, Confession of Murder feels like a great film wrapped inside of a dreadful one that suffers from disastrous editing and shoddy writing.</Review>
            <Review>The film also fills the screen with spectacular stunt work, set pieces that thrill with both insanity and absurdity, and a generous helping of tension-releasing humor.</Review>
            <Review>A confident cop vs. killer film that contains some of the most spectacular chase scenes of the year and a plot that twists more than a school dance in the '60s.</Review>

            <Review>The subject certainly isn't dated, but the film's dull post-John Hughes, sub-Judd Apatow style of comedy is like a just-buried time capsule full of accumulated clichés.</Review>
            <Review>A largely enjoyable and credible coming-of-age romp, despite some forced broadness and uneven pacing.</Review>
            <Review>Like a fresh ripple in the near-stagnant high school movie pool, Chris Nelson's "Date and Switch" balances formula with winning performers, genuine humor and a generosity of spirit that this genre too often lacks.</Review>
            <Review>In its sloppy humor and unabashedly earnest expressions of friendship and romance, the movie feels like any likable, and generally forgettable, teen comedy. And yet with its casually handled twist, the genre ambles forward just a little bit.</Review>
            <Review>It's a movie about being true to yourself that's reluctant to let its real character show. At any point that it looks likely to tweak sex-comedy convention or get truly weird, it reverses course at the last minute.</Review>
            <Review>"Date and Switch" should have had something new to say about high school friendships. It doesn't.</Review>
            <Review>In place of authentic emotion and searing personal communication, there's cliche and passivity, plasticizing the kindly nature of the picture to a point where all the tension begins to resemble a bad sitcom.</Review>
            <Review>Date And Switch is a plucky step in the right direction for diversity in teen comedies, but it lacks the extra oomph to stand on its own merits.</Review>
            <Review>Lame jokes (even when delivered by comedic vets like Megan Mullally and Nick Offerman) mixed with painfully paced sequences make this potential-filled rom-com fall flat.</Review>
            <Review>The film's forced quirkiness and repeated displays of bro-ism in action hinder the potential for a more subtle approach to the potentially challenging issue the story depicts.</Review>

Gorgeous, seductive and multiply addicted, Elizabeth eagerly introduces Doug to extra-large martinis, uninhibited bedroom behavior and the illicit pleasures of the pharmacopeia he has access to in his store.(c) Goldwyn</StoryLine>

            <Review>"Better Living Through Chemistry" as a whole feels rather superficial and safe.</Review>
            <Review>By the time the film gets to its ridiculous stretch of an ending, we've all seen the great fun to be had with drugs while also learning of their danger. How convenient. How empty.</Review>
            <Review>Sam Rockwell's committed performance can't save the glib debut of filmmakers Geoff Moore and David Posamentier.</Review>
            <Review>An ill-conceived if mildly amusing comedy about middle-class ennui, sexual frustration, and drug abuse.</Review>
            <Review>"Better Living Through Chemistry" ... is too much like the pretty suburbs it was shot in - neat and slick and comfortable. But ultimately, and deliberately, safe.</Review>
            <Review>A tepid but pleasant comic satire given a shot of contemporaneity by its writing and directing team, Geoff Moore and David Posamentier, and its star Sam Rockwell.</Review>
            <Review>If nothing else, the directors have assembled an impressive, if underutilized cast.</Review>
            <Review>It's got some of the comic-noir-y small town murder plot of 'To Die For' without the payoff. It's got some of the male midlife crisis of 'American Beauty' without the nuance.</Review>
            <Review>Some chemicals, when combined, manage only to become inert.</Review>
            <Review>It takes only half-hearted jabs at suburban angst and the pharmaceutical industry in favor of feel-good cuteness.</Review>
            <Review>Better Living Through Chemistry seems all too happy to paddle around in the shallow end and ape much more significant works, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it.</Review>
            <Review>There are plenty of fine comedic moments in Better Living, it's just that the deeper exploration of life, expectations of and pursuit of happiness is as rote and exciting as getting a prescription filled.</Review>

            <Review>Boys of Abu Ghraib is a credible depiction of the tedium, frustration and humiliation of wartime service.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director-star Luke Moran's drama about Abu Ghraib is an ambitious if not particularly revealing debut.</Review>
            <Review>"Boys of Abu Ghraib" has a few, brief insights into how boredom, anger, and frustration helped fuel the rage that led to torture but the film couches it all in the filmmaking of TV-movie melodrama, draining it of all potential power or social context.</Review>
            <Review>A halfhearted attempt at truly getting inside these men's and women's heads to make sense of their actions, which is ostensibly the purpose of dramatizing such a recent and shameful ordeal.</Review>
            <Review>The film hardly scratches Abu Ghraib's surface.</Review>
            <Review>Its tendency to water down the realities of Abu Ghraib trivializes its subject instead of providing depth or context.</Review>
            <Review>Moran's writing and directing debut is an admirably ambitious examination of the one-baby-step-at-a-time process that leads a fundamentally decent person to shut down his moral compass do things that are, by any objective standard, reprehensible.</Review>
            <Review>It's a shame the picture ends on its knees when it had to the potential to create a certain viewpoint that could invite an understanding of the Abu Ghraib prison environment and the stress placed on all involved parties.</Review>
            <Review>What made these soldiers participate in such deplorable activities? Boys of Abu Ghraib attempts to answer that question. The explanations it comes up with may not be definitive, but they certainly make for a powerful, hard-hitting drama.</Review>
            <Review>For a film about the hardened soldiers who oversaw the most notorious detainment center of the Iraq War, Boys Of Abu Ghraib is remarkably squeamish about tackling its subject matter head-on.</Review>

        <Title>JFK: A President Betrayed</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>91</Duration>
        <StoryLine>The Kennedy Administration, the golden days of our American "Camelot", is one of the most written about and popular periods of American history. But there is one profound and moving story still waiting to be told. JFK: A President Betrayed uncovers new evidence that reveals how President John F. Kennedy boldly reversed deeply entrenched pro-war government policy to embark on secret back-channel peace efforts with Russian President Nikita Khrushchev, Cuban dictator Fidel Castro and other "enemies" of the United States. The film raises many questions as to whom his real enemies were. JFK: A President Betrayed offers a poignant look at the 35th president's desperate, solitary struggle to mitigate armed conflict and makes clear the extent to which he risked political capital - and, ultimately, his life - to pull the world back from the brink of war and possible nuclear annihilation. Featuring new, probing interviews with advisors to Kennedy and Khrushchev, JFK: A President Betrayed is a meticulously well-researched portrait of a president who refused the counsel of powerful, hawkish government officials advocating for, among other things, a U.S. nuclear strike against the Soviet Union. Instead, Kennedy learned to trust his gut - instincts forged by the considerable suffering he experienced during the Second World War, and tested by the early crises of his administration.

            <Review>V.C. Andrews' popular and creepy 1979 novel Flowers in the Attic gets no favors from the scriptwriters in this latest adaptation.</Review>
            <Review>The problem is not that it's just terrible, but that it's also no fun. At all.</Review>
            <Review>It was adapted into a middling creepy film in 1987. Now Lifetime has remade it as a sharper creepy TV movie.</Review>
            <Review>I was particularly delighted when the children figured out that their mother was trying to kill them with powdered rat poison sprinkled on donuts, but this should all be a lot more frightening - or at least more unsettling - than it winds up being.</Review>
            <Review>The problem is [it] always sounds like it's more fun, or at least more kooky, than it actually plays onscreen.</Review>
            <Review>All the actors are spot-on, even ones who have just a few scenes.</Review>
            <Review>All four films in this series based on the V.C. Andrews novels are among the dozens of offerings featured in the 2015 holiday gift guide at ReelBob.com.</Review>
            <Review>Frankly, the best Lifetime movies straddle that fine line between "totally engaging look at serious issues" and "overacted campy mess" very well, and "FitA" just didn't cut it. It was ... kinda boring, right?</Review>
            <Review>The production moves at a brisk pace, and unlike the children's predicament, never feels claustrophobic.</Review>
            <Review>'80s pulp novel gets creepy with evil adults, incest.</Review>
            <Review>Escape can't come too soon.</Review>
            <Review>Lifetime goes there, then backs away from the issue immediately, making for some scenes that add nothing to the story but brief bouts of nausea.</Review>

            <Review>This Great Expectations is an absorbing addition to the roster of Dickens films that continues our 21st-century fascination with the worlds created by a 19th-century storyteller.</Review>

            <Review>This business-like adaptation hums along about as well as a movie can when it has no real reason to exist.</Review>
            <Review>While Mike Newell's adaptation of "Great Expectations" isn't a terrible one by any means, there just isn't enough here to make it worth the time of sitting through a story that's already been done many times over.</Review>

        <Duration>114</Duration>
        <StoryLine>"Recalling the work of Terrence Malick, Werner Herzog and the late Chris Marker" (Hollywood Reporter), Peter Mettler's enthralling new film combines elements of documentary, essay, and experimental cinema to create a tour de force that challenges our conception of time - and perhaps the very fabric of our existence. With stunning cinematography and a knack for capturing astonishing moments, The End of Time travels the planet - from the CERN particle accelerator outside Geneva to the lava flows of Hawaii; from a disintegrating Detroit where Henry Ford built his first factory to the tree where Buddha was enlightened. Both mind-expanding and eerily familiar, Mettler's provocative film explores the links between renewal and destruction, between primordial mysticism and the furthest reaches of modern science, giving the viewer a transcendent cinematic experience.(c) First Run Features</StoryLine>

            <Review>"We all see our own unique rainbows," he reflects, with an absence of irony that in its own way is sort of endearing. The film goes on like this, glacially, for two hours.</Review>

            <Review>To call it preachy isn't necessarily a critique; the entire film is essentially built around a closing sermon.</Review>
            <Review>Defiantly simple, like earlier stage pageants based on Langston Hughes' Christmas play, Kasi Lemmons' "Black Nativity" gains power through its directness.</Review>

        <Title>Copperhead</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>117</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Copperhead is unlike any Civil War movie to date. A story of the violent passions and burning feuds that set ablaze the home front during the Civil War, Copperhead is also a timeless and deeply moving examination of the price of dissent, the place of the individual amidst the hysteria of wartime, and the terrible price of war. Based on the extraordinary novel by Harold Frederic, which the great American critic Edmund Wilson praised as a brave and singular book that "differs fundamentally from any other Civil War fiction," Copperhead is the story of Abner Beech, a stubborn and righteous farmer of Upstate New York, who defies his neighbors and his government in the bloody and contentious autumn of 1862. With Copperhead, director Ron Maxwell, who with Gettysburg and Gods and Generals established himself as our foremost cinematic interpreter of the American Civil War, takes on the War from a stunning, unexpected and richly, unforgettably humanist angle. Copperhead is a parable of the Civil War and perhaps for our own time.(c) Film Collective</StoryLine>

            <Review>I wish "Copperhead" were better, because it tells a story we haven't seen before, and creates a world that films have rarely shown us.</Review>
            <Review>So much taste and intelligence went into these finely wrought costumes, props and sets in order to tell a story of such tedium.</Review>
            <Review>Though the tale, based on a novel by Harold Frederic, remains relevant to our time, the film is too self-conscious and tedious for the message it delivers.</Review>
            <Review>If every war has more than one side, this story of one man who dares to stand against the tide of history has a contemporary relevance that remains uncontested.</Review>
            <Review>Sluggish drama ... defines this morality lesson about the unimpeachable virtue of loving thy neighbor.</Review>
            <Review>Less like a peering examination of the turbulent political environment than a reenactment of a Ken Burns documentary-or a museum tour.</Review>
            <Review>Maxwell and Kauffman merit praise for acknowledging historical complexity, but the film's moral and aesthetic limitations keep Copperhead from entering this realm.</Review>
            <Review>There's a good story to be told somewhere in here, but they just couldn't get at it, choosing to stretch out and suffocate what good material they had, resulting in a bland and tedious tale that would fail to engage even the most avid history buff.</Review>
            <Review>As both politics and entertainment, it's lacking.</Review>
            <Review>For this audience, Ron Maxwell's film will prove entertaining and though-provoking, at the very least. For the rest, it is unlikely to provide much dramatic sustenance.</Review>
            <Review>A work every bit as turgid and baldly sentimental as the centerpiece lecture at a convention of historical reenactors.</Review>
            <Review>Its budgetary limitations show. Many scenes could have used additional takes to polish the performances, and the often-poor sound recording is a shortcoming, particularly with stylized period dialogue. The leads show surprisingly little range.</Review>

            <Review>Pretty much everything in this South Korean co-production is slightly undercooked, lacking the same degree of sprightly wit or dramatic punch regularly found in A-list studio product.</Review>
            <Review>The whole thing looks like a video game you'd rather not play.</Review>
            <Review>The bottom line: Kids may be mildly amused by The Nut Job, but adults accompanying them won't find much to capture their interest.</Review>
            <Review>The Nut Job is a delightfully goofy slapstick cartoon with a surprisingly dark heart.</Review>
            <Review>While the film isn't the worst of its kind, it might be one of the dullest of recent vintage.</Review>
            <Review>Only a multilevel chase sequence involving Surly and some glowing-eyed street rats has any real kinetic excitement, and the supporting characters lack visual distinction.</Review>
            <Review>This is the cinematic equivalent of a nut with no kernel, a film with no heart.</Review>
            <Review>Children under seven will enjoy the slapstick nature of the fun and the irresistible Gangnam Style end credits sequence [but] parents might question why a film of this nature needs to feature humans using guns.</Review>

            <Review>The sheer warmth and liveliness of Fiennes's Dickens means he's impossible not to like.</Review>
            <Review>Fiennes and screenwriter Abi Morgan adapt Claire Tomalin's book with delicate grace, presenting love as blessing, curse and, perhaps, inevitable force.</Review>
            <Review>Why did this bright, vivacious, intellectually engaged girl willingly lock herself up in a wealthy man's seraglio? Put bluntly, what did she get out of it? In the end, "The Invisible Woman" remains a mystery.</Review>
            <Review>It's wonderfully cast ... and beautifully designed; a quiet pleasure.</Review>
            <Review>An air of complacency hangs over the project; its condemnation of Victorian sexism makes us congratulate ourselves for our more enlightened views.</Review>
            <Review>Even if you don't entirely buy this version of events, director Ralph Fiennes has given us a speculation that works as drama. It's an elegant bit of goods.</Review>
            <Review>Far more attentive to visual storytelling than most actors who step behind the camera, Fiennes conveys shifting dynamics through his characters' positions within the frame.</Review>
            <Review>It's unhurried yet confident, familiar yet provocative. With fine cinematography by Robert Hardy (Blitz), most 'Expectations' will, indeed, be met.</Review>
            <Review>The performances are first-rate -- Fiennes and Jones are stellar, as are Kristin Scott Thomas as Nelly's mother and Tom Hollander as playwright Collins -- and the score and period details are sumptuous. But the film still drags.</Review>
            <Review>The Invisible Woman is a beautiful picture with strong performances, but made unnecessarily convoluted.</Review>
            <Review>The Invisible Woman is so subtle and secretive that it sets a record as the most low-keyed of its usually feverish genre.</Review>
            <Review>The Invisible Woman is a fine-looking period piece and Fiennes has an eye for nuance as Dickens tries handling the public news of his private life in a world that has just discovered the thrill of newspaper gossip.</Review>

            <Review>What at first seems formulaic comedy gains a deeper resonance as we see how they represent two responses to cruelty and injustice -- first outrage, and with time, eventually, forgiveness.</Review>
            <Review>It's smart and unsweetened.</Review>
            <Review>Even as Philomena embraces the expected feel-good dynamics, it avoids taking the usual path and doesn't paint all of the "evil" nuns with the same brush.</Review>
            <Review>We wouldn't care about any of this if the performances were weak. But both actors find complexity and depth.</Review>
            <Review>At its core, this clever, wrenching, profound story underscores the tenacity of faith in the face of unfathomable cruelty.</Review>
            <Review>Director Steven Frears deserves special mention. A lesser filmmaker could so easily have turned this project into mushy, sentimental junk. The tear-jerking moments here are heartfelt and real. It's the kind of filmmaking we see too little of today.</Review>
            <Review>So preoccupied with score-settling, it is frankly rather embarrassing, like that obnoxious relative at Thanksgiving dinner who insists on revisiting each and every perceived slight.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is a bit of a puzzle coming from atheist co-writer Steve Coogan and the script grapples with these big questions of religion, class, and justice in a way that's far beyond the typical teary human-interest story.</Review>
            <Review>Like Coogan's reporter, you'll want to wrap your arms around Judi Dench's Philomena and take her home. You can't, of course - but Philomena will follow you there anyway.</Review>
            <Review>Dench gives a superb performance as a simple, trusting woman of faith.</Review>
            <Review>Dench and Cooper could do this stuff in their sleep and keep us entertained, which they do, but it's the nuanced twists and turns in both the characters and the story that elevate the picture beyond the familiar.</Review>
            <Review>I'd be a grouch to call the two leads anything but delightful, and they both stretch in directions you mightn't expect.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Micky is a fun-loving photographer, living a party lifestyle in London until a chance encounter with a childhood friend changes her world forever. The opposite to life-and-soul Micky, Do is a quiet bank clerk, with little by way of a social life. Yet much to the annoyance of her DJ boyfriend Jake, Micky is all too delighted to reacquaint herself with Do, embracing her old friend with typical gusto. But when they return to the tranquil French villa where they spent so many happy summers in their youth, tragedy strikes. A fire engulfs the building, leaving Do dead and Micky badly burnt and blighted by amnesia. Unable to even recall her own name, Micky is forced on a shocking journey of self-discovery. For nothing - friends, relatives, lovers and even herself - is as she remembers it. (c) IFC Midnight</StoryLine>

            <Review>The erotic thriller "Trap for Cinderella" is neither erotic nor thrilling, but rather reliant on cheap nudity and multiple mistaken-identity switcheroos in hopes of keeping us on edge.</Review>
            <Review>Softley negotiates layers of deceit with skill, but an uncharacteristic visual and narrative tightness leaves one wondering what might have been.</Review>
            <Review>The plot is ludicrously far-fetched, but despite some plodding dialogue, committed performances from leads Tuppence Middleton and Alexandra Roach make this tale of jealousy and betrayal a heady treat.</Review>
            <Review>Despite some strong performances and an interesting style, there are just too many holes in the story, keeping Trap For Cinderella from being a completely compelling thriller.</Review>
            <Review>Initially intriguing, but essentially a forgettable B-movie that's more exhausting and frustrating than fun or suspenseful.</Review>
            <Review>Ian Softley is far too interested in the minutia of the plot to bother with the Chabrolian elements of bourgeois excess or the Hitchcockian themes of mistaken identity.</Review>
            <Review>This overblown melodrama mistakes sensationalism for story, and is yet another repulsive tale of women's friendships as toxic.</Review>
            <Review>Softley is a great director but has maybe let his own obsession - with Sebastien Japrisot's 1962 novel - blind him to the essential lameness of the project. Someone lend this man a good book.</Review>
            <Review>Trap For Cinderella achieves the considerable feat of being as pretentious and annoying as its lead characters' names.</Review>
            <Review>Maybe a Hitchcock or Chabrol could have made something gripping from the melodrama and mystery of it all but this feels workmanlike and obvious.</Review>
            <Review>There's a very classy cast in supporting roles (Kerry Fox, Frances de la Tour, Alex Jennings) but this fails to come alive.</Review>
            <Review>tylish and moody, this twisty dramatic thriller gets under our skin with its mysterious tone and darkly insinuating performances.</Review>

            <Review>Nothing in the movie makes sense, but I prefer to think that "Ride Along" is just a badly told joke, rather than an insult to its audience.</Review>
            <Review>Ride Along is saddled with an uninvolving plot, and largely content to coast on cop-movie clichés.</Review>
            <Review>The most truthful answer is friendly but unexciting: They're OK. They're pretty good.</Review>
            <Review>As a comedian [Hart] has been begging for Hollywood's attention for five years. He has it now, but you've got to believe he can do better than this.</Review>
            <Review>This routine buddy picture offers plenty of instant gratification (Cube and Hart are easygoing screen presences, and many of their one-liners are funny) but shows little concern for characterization, storytelling, or even comic pacing.</Review>
            <Review>This is a live-action cartoon.</Review>
            <Review>Ride Along will at the very least entertain despite any inherent contrivances.</Review>

            <Review>This is one of the more disappointing efforts of the holiday movie season.</Review>
            <Review>Stiller's attempt to braid together introspection and humor kept me engaged and curious, even when I wasn't quite sure what he was setting out to do.</Review>
            <Review>Stiller's sensibility creates a movie that's smarter than you think it will be. Kind of like Walter Mitty himself.</Review>
            <Review>Sometimes you see failed films and think, well, they tried for this or that but couldn't pull it off. After seeing Ben Stiller's version of the venerable James Thurber story, I don't know what the film was trying for.</Review>
            <Review>It has little narrative interest and requires that the director latch onto a very specific airy tone of whimsy, lest the whole souffle collapse.</Review>
            <Review>Painstakingly stylish, this is Stiller's most ambitious directorial work to date but also his most cloying.</Review>
            <Review>This is surprisingly nowhere near the Hollywood nightmare you might be thinking (or fearing).</Review>
            <Review>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a good-hearted delight.</Review>
            <Review>The most universally satisfying Hollywood films are usually predicated on a dialectical relationship... But Walter Mitty is too clumsy and afraid to offend to properly take that journey, not unlike its titular character.</Review>
            <Review>With such high aims, it's too bad that 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' falls somewhat short of greatness. But it's not often that you come across a "big" movie as earnest and patently un-cynical as this one.</Review>
            <Review>[Stiller's] creative fingerprints are few and far between here, the pic's spoon-fed schmaltziness betraying [his] typical satiric edge.</Review>
            <Review>Somehow, out of a no-win situation, Stiller manages to make a likable movie that entertains while also providing a little get-out-of-the-basement inspiration.</Review>

            <Review>By all the accounts presented in Randall Wood's eminently fun, feisty portrait of artistic eccentricity, the formidable reputation of the mammoth, rarely performed Gothic Symphony by little-known British composer Havergal Brian is richly deserved.</Review>
            <Review>Extremely similar in theme, structure and tone to last year's Mrs. Carey's Concert, it suffers in comparison to that exquisite film, but it certainly stands alone as a swift, entertaining look at a very particular artistic quest.</Review>
            <Review>This gripping film takes us inside the belly of the creative beast - several bellies in fact, from that of the now dead composer, eccentric Englishman with the back to front name, Havergal Brian, through the entire cast of musicians and filmmakers</Review>
            <Review>The elements of this documentary are revealed like a rising crescendo, as we become involved in the struggles, frustrations &amp; triumphs of a dedicated group that attempts to stage the mammoth work - in Brisbane</Review>

            <Review>Whatever tension the pic manages to build ... is mostly undercut by the recurring appearance of the fish and by the generally overemphatic performances of the human cast ...</Review>
            <Review>As shrill as it often is, the film's situational peril makes otherwise unlikable characters sympathetic, or maybe just sympathetic enough.</Review>
            <Review>A proudly lowbrow, low-budget monster movie that sees nothing wrong with the cheap-and-dirty shortcuts of yesteryear.</Review>
            <Review>The title doesn't just refer to what lurks in the lake's still water. It's a guide to where Beneath's substance lies, the acid heart inside its plastic chest.</Review>
            <Review>The whole film is a campy put-on, right? Apparently not.</Review>
            <Review>A few things could have been improved upon, but it's at least ambitious and has an interesting twist.</Review>
            <Review>Beneath is both a tribute to monster-in-the-woods and the creature-under-the-water horror and a genuine indie drama in the guise of a horror film.</Review>
            <Review>The film is simply too sloppy and full of holes, many of which should have been easily noticed from the writing of the script through pre-production.</Review>
            <Review>[Blu-ray Review] Well shot and technically competent. It's also a bit of an insult to the viewer's intelligence.</Review>
            <Review>Feels as if it were made by an amateur on his second film...</Review>
            <Review>Beautifully shot, but marked by a screenplay that mistakes and substitutes volume for well staked-out, compelling interpersonal disagreement.</Review>
            <Review>There just isn't enough going on beneath Beneath.</Review>

            <Review>There's no getting past the nonsense formality of taking that camera everywhere.</Review>
            <Review>The plot is a confusing, derivative mishmash of half-baked supernatural clichés, and the total absence of characterization makes it hard to care what happens.</Review>
            <Review>The leads are appealing but the best scares will be familiar to anyone who has seen the previous films - or, for that matter, the trailer.</Review>
            <Review>This fifth in the series further diminishes the promise of the 2007 original, replacing mystery and suspense with predictability and misogyny.</Review>
            <Review>The novelty of "found footage" wore off almost immediately upon arrival, and yet the "style" persists, despite the fact (or maybe because of the fact) that it's tired and lazy.</Review>
            <Review>Provides the familiar cheap thrills but with a salsa tang.</Review>
            <Review>The scares are effective and unsettling, and work better because they depend less on the Where's Waldo? compositions of the other sequels and more on character dynamics.</Review>
            <Review>Hands down, The Marked Ones is absolutely relentless, creepy as hell and a ton of fun on the big screen- it totally surprised me and left me with my enthusiasm for the PA series renewed.</Review>
            <Review>This film is not scary, it's simply an exercise in waiting for a loud, ear piercing musical cue that forces us to be startled.</Review>
            <Review>The law of diminishing returns mean this is now an exercise repetition: the tricks have all lost their power to terrify and The Marked Ones is just a vaguely spooky shadow of its a former self.</Review>
            <Review>A great effort, but a sub-par horror film.</Review>
            <Review>Overall, it's an unbalanced film, with several laugh out loud moments and thrilling action sequences, but it lacks the memorable scares required for this to rate any higher than an above average horror film.</Review>

A series of unexpected adventures including, getting kicked out of a strip club, being mugged and getting pummeled by the Las Vegas' reigning gelatin-wrestling champion, Veronica, rip them from the glitz and glamour of the Las Vegas strip and places them smack dab in Vegas' seedy underbelly. Determined to keep their bachelorette party dreams alive, the girls band together and embark on the wildest night in bachelorette party history. Fueled by sex and booze, this raunchy, riotously hilarious, out-of-control, blow-out is, for better or worse, all caught on tape. And is destined to go down as the Best Night Ever.

            <Review>Anyone who can sit through the whole thing and smile approvingly afterward gets my sympathy, and also probably deserves some kind of award for delivering a performance more convincing than any ever seen in one of their films.</Review>
            <Review>Comedy requires a more delicate, specific touch, but here, the air is slowly let out of the balloon as the scenes limp forward.</Review>

            <Review>Likely to be appreciated only by homeless viewers who need a quiet place to nap during the cold months of winter ...</Review>

            <Review>What's right about Best Night Ever begins and ends with its cast, who have a nice rapport. The film, however, settles into a manic groove that is at once nonsensical and familiar.</Review>
            <Review>Nearly every one of the film's attempts at comedy is clichéd, tasteless, or forced-sometimes all three at once</Review>
            <Review>Friedberg and Seltzer trade in one gimmick for another.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>102</Duration>
        <StoryLine>In nature, the snake and mongoose are the deadliest of enemies-genetically encoded to eternally fight to the death without mercy. Beginning in the 1960's, the nature of that dynamic was strategically and expertly applied to the historic rivalry between Don Prudhomme and Tom McEwen in the most unlikely of venues-a "minor" sport struggling for attention on dusty drag-racing strips at tracks across the country. There, Prudhomme, the Snake, and McEwen, the Mongoo$e, did, in fact, compete aggressively for dominance in the nascent sport of drag racing. Racing aficionados probably know that much of the story by now. But, what if that rivalry spawned something more than victories and defeats? What if it created a unique and unlikely friendship out of the smoke of battle? What if Snake and Mongoo$e were quietly the closest of friends even as their rivalry intensified? What if they shared the joy and pain of life when they were not busy competing? What if their mutual respect, racing nerve, thirst for fame and compensation, and their desire to advance their thrilling, but extremely dangerous, sport brought them together as something more than mere rivals? What if a perfect storm of conditions transformed their competition into something greater-a blood kinship that enabled them to team up in order to revolutionize an entire industry?

            <Review>The movie itself apparently isn't sure the murders themselves are lurid enough. So it adds a few things that didn't happen, plus some 21st-century music.</Review>
            <Review>The movie ends on such a note as to cause the audience to wonder how long it will take before "A," of Pretty Little Liars fame, starts leaving Lizzie Borden an incriminating text or two.</Review>
            <Review>It's slow and heavy-handed, tedious almost throughout. An average episode of Oxygen's Snapped isn't this dull, and has more interesting things to say about women who kill.</Review>
            <Review>Lizzie Borden takes an ax to many assumptions -- including the one that Lifetime movies aren't worth watching.</Review>
            <Review>Lizzie comes across more as a whiny, moody teen than a psychotic murderess, and Ricci is much-too-attractive to play the dowdy, crazy-eyed Lizzie familiar from those faded black-and-white photos (just sayin').</Review>
            <Review>Christina Ricci does a haunting turn as notorious hatchet swinger Lizzie Borden.</Review>
            <Review>Lifetime's made-for-TV movie Lizzie Borden Took an Axe covers the events of the murder and ensuing trial, but doesn't really get any deeper into the crime than the schoolyard chant does.</Review>
            <Review>Included are the trial and all the trimmings. What's missing is the horror of the event. Except for a few shots of dear old daddy's caved-in face, there's not much gore, even for a TV movie.</Review>
            <Review>There's a too-quick and convenient wrap-up to the film, but that's the only real sour note Lizzie Borden Took an Ax hits.</Review>
            <Review>Brutal murders, courtroom drama in historical drama.</Review>
            <Review>Lifetime has a knack for attracting top-tier talent for what often ends up being silly little movies, but Lizzie Borden seemed different -- everyone was having a lot of fun without getting too over-the-top campy.</Review>
            <Review>The lack of focus, and a protagonist who seemingly can't decide which movie she's in, makes this Lifetime movie a slick but unsatisfying swing and a miss.</Review>

            <Review>[A] stale, schmaltzy and testosterone-drenched comedy.</Review>
            <Review>Nostalgia needs to be grounded in something real, something true, in order for it to have any resonance. Otherwise, you're just left with a formula that was tired 20 years ago.</Review>
            <Review>There are a lot of odious movies yet to come in 2014, no doubt, but they'll have to work to beat "Back in the Day" for awfulness.</Review>
            <Review>Cloying and smug when it's not being unfunny and crass, the high school reunion comedy "Back in the Day" hits lows with a frequency that suggests a world-class sharp shooter or free-throw king.</Review>
            <Review>Good for a couple of fart jokes and otherwise utterly forgettable.</Review>
            <Review>There aren't many laughs along the way (unless you count fart jokes), nor is there any nostalgic value.</Review>
            <Review>It's a film that feels like it's simply going through the motions-not to mention one whose ultimate critique of trying to relive the past is, in light of its mass of clichés, more than a tad disingenuous</Review>
            <Review>...the movie remains surprisingly watchable virtually from beginning to end.</Review>
            <Review>Rosenbaum's intent seems pure enough, but his concepts for comedy and intimacy leave much to be desired, making the picture difficult to understand as it weaves through heartfelt confessions and fart jokes.</Review>

            <Review>Director Doug Aarniokoski and co-screenwriter David Loughery fail to infuse the overly familiar elements with the necessary dark humor.</Review>
            <Review>I don't quite have the nerve to give it a full recommendation but I do have a certain affection for it and I wouldn't want to discourage anyone from seeing it for themselves if they were inclined to do so.</Review>
            <Review>"Nurse 3D" isn't nearly as fun as a movie about a homicidal, sex-obsessed, clothing-averse health care provider ought to be.</Review>
            <Review>Nurse 3D successfully embraces its exploitatively sexy and sleazy demeanor with a wink and a nod, going for broke with such gonzo-style gusto that you just can't help but admire the end result.</Review>
            <Review>Somewhat surprisingly, Nurse is an amusing neo-giallo/slasher.</Review>
            <Review>Taken at face value -- which is the only way one can probably take Nurse -- it still comes up short.</Review>
            <Review>Huerta towers over the film, an Olivia De Berardinis creation brought to life in a world that might have been conjured by the combined psyches of Brian de Palma and Bob Guccione.</Review>
            <Review>Nurse is one of those modern, pre-fabricated cult movies like The Human Centipede or Sharknado, designed to be talked about amongst friends though never truly satisfying as a genuinely interesting piece of exploitation cinema.</Review>
            <Review>As raw exploitation, Nurse 3D [...] over-promises and under-delivers, which might have been inevitable with a title like that.</Review>
            <Review>Nurse 3D shouldn't work as well as it does, but Paz De La Huerta's enchanting insanity makes for some memorably debaucherous midnight movie moments.</Review>
            <Review>As good-to-be-bad movies go, Nurse is about as good as it gets. Or bad. Or... wait I don't know. Look, Paz de la Huerta is naked, okay?!</Review>

            <Review>By the time Sylvester Stallone and Robert De Niro start training for the big match -- it's called Grudgment Day -- you give in because, surprisingly, both actors have reported for duty, especially De Niro.</Review>
            <Review>This one probably never could have been a contender.</Review>
            <Review>Pleasant but underwhelming, it feels like something that belongs on the undercard, never reaching the heights of a main event.</Review>
            <Review>"Grudge Match" at its core is an affront to the cinema gods, an attempt to capitalize off two iconic films for a few cheap laughs.</Review>
            <Review>The jokes are clumsy, the dramatic scenes stale and lifeless; like the climactic bout, the movie itself is a freak show, a fantasy matchup between two icons with nothing better to do than spend down their legacies.</Review>
            <Review>Stick with your memories of Rocky Balboa and Jake La Motta, because "Grudge Match" isn't a fight worth fighting.</Review>
            <Review>A story that's so on-the-nose that it appears to be following some predetermined rubric of what constitutes success for a sports comeback flick.</Review>
            <Review>"(Not only) is this sports comedy poorly timed, it has more than just a whiff of desperation, both on the part of its remaining cast and the filmmaker."</Review>
            <Review>Grudge Match certainly has enough successful elements to be moderately entertaining, although it's hard not to wish it contained fewer distractions.</Review>
            <Review>If you're from my generation, it's worth checking out for the nostalgia factor, even if much of the film will be lost on the younger generation.</Review>
            <Review>I do have to marvel at the way Stallone has always been able to make himself the underdog. This is a massive monster of a man who should by any account be the Goliath to any movie's David, yet he's always able to play vulnerable.</Review>
            <Review>I never bought Stallone and De Niro as arch enemies harboring a 30-year grudge, let alone as former professional boxers.</Review>

            <Review>A glimpse of a surprisingly shy and gentle soul who longed to be a star.</Review>
            <Review>It's hard to go wrong with a movie about famed drag queen Divine, and director Jeffrey Schwarz certainly doesn't in "I Am Divine," a serious documentary about this gloriously trashy trailblazer.</Review>
            <Review>In "I Am Divine," bolstered by plentiful interviews with Waters and other collaborators, Schwarz effectively turns Milstead into the life of a party that didn't really end with his death in 1988.</Review>
            <Review>Filled with heady outrageousness at the same time it continuously skirts the apparent emptiness in the man wearing those crazy wigs.</Review>
            <Review>Schwarz understands Divine, a heroine to outsiders, and Glenn, who took the persona as far as he could and was ready for new roles. His film's celebratory pizazz suits them both.</Review>
            <Review>The Pink Flamingos star Divine gets her own well-deserved spotlight.</Review>
            <Review>A fascinating larger-than-life portrait of its larger-than-life subject, I Am Divine is a beguiling blend of poignancy, humor and glorious excess.</Review>
            <Review>It's surprisingly moving stuff - dressed up with just enough archival outrage to remind you how scandalous Divine once seemed.</Review>
            <Review>The interviewees and even his mother, with whom he was reconciled late in his life, all portray him as a generous and very sweet-natured man.</Review>

            <Review>Schwarz interviews friends and fans, piecing together a picture of a gentle, perhaps surprisingly shy man who channelled his family's rejection and his anger at society into his outrageous alter-ego.</Review>
            <Review>Despite the sadness, we are reminded of what an influential figure Divine was, and how his very presence continues to bring comfort to others who identify as outsiders.</Review>

            <Review>The tale has no emotional resonance, and the thinness of the plot (only five of the book's chapters are adapted here) and the colorless depictions of the leading characters do it no favors.</Review>
            <Review>Be forewarned: Whether through ego, avarice, or unchecked enthusiasm, Jackson has wandered deep into the realm of fan fiction.</Review>
            <Review>With the introductions and bag-packing out of the way from the first film, the new movie jumps straight into the action and doesn't relent until the cliffhanger ending almost three hours later.</Review>
            <Review>For the casual but compelled moviegoer, The Desolation of Smaug is a fine improvement over the first offering. Tolkien aficionados may feel otherwise.</Review>
            <Review>Desolation of Smaug looks as dreary as the title would lead you to believe. The whole thing lingers in the memory as piles of sludge and ash.</Review>
            <Review>I'm not an aficionado of J.R.R. Tolkien's wonderworlds and I was bored with the first Hobbit movie. All this is by way of saying I quite liked its sequel and the second in the trilogy.</Review>
            <Review>The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug manages to zip nicely along. Yes, it's 2 hours and 40 minutes. But it doesn't really feel like it.</Review>
            <Review>Yes, this is evolution in the right direction, but now it's time to take that energy and give us a final chapter that will move and inspire as well as dazzle.</Review>
            <Review>If you are content to spend as much time in Middle Earth as possible, you'll have plenty of fun with this year's installment. But if you're a stickler for literary accuracy and pacing, the offering may prove only slightly less frustrating.</Review>
            <Review>The most fun part of the film comes as the dwarves flee the elven holding block in oak kegs and shoot down whitewater rapids through a gauntlet of orcs.</Review>
            <Review>Middle-earth should never feel this middling.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Acclaimed director Claire Denis's jagged, daringly fragmented and darkest film is a genuinely contemporary film noir inspired by recent French sex ring scandals involving men of wealth and power. Vincent Lindon (Denis's Friday Night) stars as Marco, a sea captain gone AWOL to avenge his brother-in-law's suicide and to rescue his estranged sister and his teenaged niece (Lola Cr�ton, Goodbye First Love); Chiara Mastroianni (A Christmas Tale) is Lindon's married lover, who has sold her soul in exchange for the security of her young son; and the remarkable Michel Subor is her husband - a sleazy financier who is the very embodiment of an evil beyond comprehension. Denis takes the viewer into the very heart of darkness in her most unsettling film yet, an unforgettable and thrilling commentary on late capitalism.

            <Review>An imperfect film but a perfectly mesmerizing one.</Review>
            <Review>This is a film so anxious to be taken seriously that it has evaded seriousness itself.</Review>
            <Review>The movie ends where it might have begun, and merely states mysteries that remain unexplored.</Review>
            <Review>"Bastards" is a thriller truly etched in darkness, pools of black broken mostly by the stricken yet soldiering faces of her main characters, like ships in a sea of stormy nights.</Review>
            <Review>There's nothing wrong with dealing out a dense, noir-like plot in tiny scraps - unless, like "Bastards," the film remains flaccid and tensionless.</Review>
            <Review>Bastards skillfully deploys noir tropes-the alienated hero, the two-timing femme fatale, the ever-widening web of deceit-in the service of a larger political vision.</Review>
            <Review>In a year where art-house releases and blockbusters were seemingly in competition for the longest running time, Claire Denis' Bastards is an exercise in pure economy.</Review>
            <Review>Like most of Denis's work, Bastards provides no clear conclusions and her characters' behavior remains just as ineffable, endlessly complex, and unknowable as human behavior in real life.</Review>
            <Review>[Denis]'s story shards are so refracted there is no emotional stake to grasp onto</Review>
            <Review>Bastards is Denis' most eventful, impactful film in quite some time. But one couldn't warmly recommend it.</Review>
            <Review>It could be that genre fans or French cinema enthusiasts may be engaged, but the murky visuals and non-linear nature of the narrative left me cold.</Review>
            <Review>Claire Denis comes unstuck with this drearily angst-ridden tale of suicide, sexual violence and incestuous strife, which takes inspiration from Faulkner's Sanctuary and Kurosawa's The Bad Sleep Well.</Review>

            <Review>This masterwork is set in contemporary China, where the gulf between those able to maneuver (or manipulate) the country's economies of change and those left behind or defeated by the seismic shifts widens.</Review>
            <Review>In two decades of moviemaking, China's Jia Zhangke has examined the damage of his country's explosive growth with a poetic sense of outrage. With his latest effort, the implied violence bubbles over.</Review>
            <Review>Jia is passionate about his characters, but that never compromises his considerable artistic control.</Review>
            <Review>Drawing on four news stories, writer-director Jia Zhangke portrays the plight of workers in the new China. Set in four provinces, A Touch of Sin is humanist critique of the country's turn to capitalism.</Review>
            <Review>Jia offers a stark presentation (no music, few edits) that discourages vicarious thrills; the violence is startling, not cool.</Review>
            <Review>Jia's primary concern here is the solitary suffering of his characters, punished to the point where they can't take anymore.</Review>
            <Review>The wuxia killings elevate A Touch of Sin into the territory of great revenge pictures, even as its ideology proves less than discernible.</Review>
            <Review>Jia is one of those moviemakers who can tell a story in a single shot, and his eloquence is hard at work here ...</Review>
            <Review>A grueling experience. One that feels sadly necessary.</Review>
            <Review>A kind of Chinese Pulp Fiction with a political pulse, it adds up to a powerful portrait of desperate individuals driven to extremes by official corruption and runaway commercial development.</Review>
            <Review>It's a movie that's bitterly violent, both physically and emotionally, and a tremendous exploration of the have-nots in a society that is mostly known for its haves.</Review>
            <Review>It might be my least favorite of (Jia's) movies, but I still count it as one of the best films of 2013 which should tell you what I think of this extraordinary filmmaker.</Review>

            <Review>A sometimes wickedly funny but ultimately sour, loud, draining tale of one of the most dysfunctional families in modern American drama.</Review>
            <Review>This star-studded loopy melodrama is brash, foul-mouthed, self-consciously offensive, intermittently insightful and has a gaping hole where its heart should be.</Review>
            <Review>August: Osage County is all about the acting. That makes sense because the storyline doesn't offer much that could be considered new or remarkable.</Review>
            <Review>With so many scenes that end in harsh emotional purging, there's little opportunity for the cast to put the fun in dysfunctional.</Review>
            <Review>August: Osage County is easier to watch on screen, and maybe for that we should be grateful. But there's also something to be said for sitting shell-shocked afterward, shaken and relieved to be free from witnessing more of this family's downfall.</Review>
            <Review>Although a couple of performances here may earn Oscar nominations, by the time you've sat through the wreckage, you're left with the sense that this really must have worked better onstage.</Review>
            <Review>The A-list cast makes it a good watch, and the impressive production design makes for a suitable-enough stage replacement.</Review>
            <Review>Problem is, with about ten families' worth of dysfunction packed in, and no happy resolution, what kind of a cinematic experience is it? The fingernails-on-a-blackboard kind.</Review>
            <Review>This cast and crew is so well suited to bring this story to life that it's nearly serendipitous, and the film will play like catnip to fans of the play.</Review>
            <Review>Every ill-considered editing choice here bears the sticky fingerprints of statuette-grubbing producer Harvey Weinstein, attempting to tame this rough material for mass consumption by Oscar voters.</Review>
            <Review>Sure to be divisive, "August: Osage County" is tenacious and beautifully constructed. Soulful and unafraid to show the gritty and ugly of the American family,</Review>
            <Review>Nothing makes you feel better about your dysfunctional family at the holidays than watching a messed-up clan unravel on screen, only armed with better zingers and prettier faces. That describes this adaptation of Tracy Letts's star-studded drama.</Review>

After being fired from his own father's company, he feels like his luck has run out - until Morgan (Dennis) enters into his life.

            <Review>A joyous ode to a lost era of music making that will delight music buffs and those who appreciate a well-done documentary.</Review>
            <Review>A cocky, affectionate and very musical documentary that may make its central point a few times too often.</Review>
            <Review>In his directing debut, Dave Grohl shows the instincts of a real filmmaker. Sound City hits you like a shot in the heart.</Review>
            <Review>Even if you don't know what [Grohl's] talking about when he says a room gives "great decay," or when somebody else extols "24-track sensibility," the passion of this project really pops right out of the groove.</Review>
            <Review>[Grohl] has great fun sweeping through the historic parade of latter-day rock royalty whose hit records came out of the place.</Review>
            <Review>Sound City is a fun ride for diehard fans of most any brand of rock and roll.</Review>
            <Review>A sincere tribute to the tape-based dumpy Sound City.</Review>

            <Review>It's (a) part documentary homage to the defunct Los Angeles rock-and-roll studio where Grohl's earlier band, Nirvana, cut its breakout album, 'Nevermind'; and (b) part self-promotion for the DVD release of this very film and its companion CD soundtrack.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Documentarian Al Reinert's compelling portrait of Michael Morton, a man convicted of brutally beating his wife to death in 1987, suggests that there may have been a miscarriage of justice in Morton's trial and sentencing. Morton has continued to insist he was not responsible for the murder throughout his stay in prison, and hopes his self-proclaimed innocence will help in an inquiry suggesting the prosecutor in his case never turned over information to his defense that may have exonerated him. ~ Tracie Cooper, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>So much better than one would expect for a fifth installment in a franchise, this tribute to female friendship and girl power is a kick.</Review>
            <Review>True flights of fancy - as when the fairies make an imaginary man walk and dance by manipulating an overcoat, tricorn hat and buckled boots - are far too rare.</Review>
            <Review>There are some gorgeous Disney touches, rabble-rousing songs on the pirate ship and the usual 'best friends for ever' message.</Review>
            <Review>The Pirate Fairy shimmers and shines and couldn't be prettier. It's bursting with old-fashioned girl power and although there's nothing new it will make fun excursion if you've got young girls on your hands these holidays.</Review>
            <Review>Disney animators had fun with this one, coloring mostly within the lines of the Pixie Hollow movies but slipping outrageously outside the margins every now and then as they offer a rollicking prequel to Peter Pan.</Review>
            <Review>Ranks right up near the very best of the its franchise and thus the very best direct-to-video Disney movies ever.</Review>
            <Review>Sweet and simplistic, it won't offer you the bells and whistles of Frozen.</Review>
            <Review>It's an engaging and entertaining adventure story, refreshingly centered around a group of distinct female characters and even directed by a woman to boot.</Review>
            <Review>At its core, underneath the swashbuckling adventure, Tinker Bell and the Pirate Fairy is a thoughtful tale of female friendship, of appreciating individuality, opening one's mind to new possibilities and always believing in second chances.</Review>
            <Review>A lively swashbuckling affair that pits Tink and her Pixie Hollow friends against younger versions of the pirates from JM Barrie's beloved children's classic, which is a delightful notion in itself and gives the action an appealing dash and swagger.</Review>
            <Review>While Disney's cheaply made Tinkerbell films have none of the cultural cachet of more lavish animated features, they're getting slyer and more interesting on their own terms.</Review>
            <Review>Terrific stuff, beautifully animated and with a nice, positive message... it is great fun and another example of how new ideas can help keep a franchise fresh.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2011</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>105</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Eccentric Japanese director Katsuhito Ishii (A Taste of Tea, Funky Forest: First Contact) takes us on a wild ride through the Japanese underworld in this darkly comic, visually dazzling tale of a failed actor who goes to extraordinary lengths to pay off an unjust Yakuza debt. Down on his luck Kinuta (Satoshi Tsumabuki) is gambling away his last quarters in a dingy casino when he's suddenly approached with a lucrative opportunity. But it's more of a trap than a chance to get rich, and as a result Kinuta is forced to become a smuggler for the Yakuza. Apprenticing under tough talking driver Joe (Masatoshi Nagase), Kinuta joins in transporting the remains of a murdered Yakuza boss. But the job won't be easy, because their cargo's sadistic right-hand man Kawashima (Masahiro Takashima) is out for blood, and won't rest until his boss' killer has been avenged. That killer is Vertebrae (Masanobu Ando), a legendary assassin who can defeat a room of heavily-armed men with nothing but a pair of nunchucks, and whose loyal partner Viscera is never far behind. When Kinuta comes into contact with some of the most violent men in the Yakuza underworld, he discovers a side of himself that he never knew existed, and learns that his acting skills may not be as dull as he once thought. Co-starring Yasuko Matsuyuki and Hikari Mitsushima, Smuggler was adapted from the cult manga from author Shohei Manabe.</StoryLine>

            <Review>This movie about Live Action Role Players (or LARPers) -- men and women who act out Dungeons and Dragons in real settings, in costumes -- is so haphazard it might have been thought up during a game of Mad Libs.</Review>
            <Review>"Knights of Badassdom" actually delivers everything the 2011 Danny McBride-James Franco comedy "Your Highness" purported to be but fell short on.</Review>
            <Review>A one-note joke and a whiff of a story that fails to offer a single reason - literal or metaphorical - why dressing up as a fictional character is enjoyable or rewarding.</Review>
            <Review>Clumsily edited, the movie is very uneven in tone... but the spirited cast emerge from the jokey carnage with dignity, if not all their body parts, intact.</Review>
            <Review>Frequently sloppy and pretty piecemeal, but also rather funny and oddly likable. Strange flick.</Review>
            <Review>Supernatural slasher haunts a live-action role-playing game. The cast is clearly having fun, but none of it rubs off on us; Peter Dinklage and Steve Zahn are completely squandered.</Review>
            <Review>... the story lends itself to low-cost dragonslaying... Don't look for award-winning performances here, just actors having fun with a brilliant premise. Huzzah!</Review>
            <Review>I've been given a palatable taste of Joe Lynch's Knights Of Badassdom, but I'm now ready for the main course - Lynch's fabled Director's Cut.</Review>
            <Review>A spectacular horror comedy never afraid to dabble in the silly...</Review>
            <Review>Something went horribly wrong in the translation. Although spirited at times, Badassdom takes on familiar targets, while its escalation of oddity is forced when it isn't confusing.</Review>
            <Review>[E]ven while it's apparently not what its creators intended, Knights Of Badassdom is perfectly enjoyable in a low-key way, with sharp performances [...] and a nigh-endless string of cameos</Review>
            <Review>While the LARPers are ostensibly treated with affection, the film still repeatedly goes for low-hanging comedy fruit such as the histrionic and incorrect olde-English-speak they use while in-game, an obvious gag that quickly grows tiresome.</Review>

            <Review>Worth a watch despite occasional laugh-free stretches ...</Review>
            <Review>The whole thing goes down like a second, giant tumbler of scotchy scotch scotch: familiar, comforting and, ultimately, numbing.</Review>
            <Review>At its best, McKay and Ferrell's brand of homegrown American Dada can make you collapse laughing in your seat and cry uncle.</Review>
            <Review>Wine connoisseurs would call this a new Burgundy with an old bouquet.</Review>
            <Review>This is the kind of movie where most people know what they want and are pretty sure what they will get, that being "more of the same, please."</Review>
            <Review>For better or worse, Anchorman 2 is in its full glory when Ferrell goes off the rails and the film follows him into the swirl of blatantly idiotic randomness.</Review>
            <Review>In their big, expensive, hyper-marketed Christmas studio movie, they're doing the same kind of Fox-mocking that Jon Stewart does every night.</Review>
            <Review>It all leads to a final showdown, after some ridiculous twists and turns, which is as hilarious as it is star-studded. It's almost worth the two hours just to see who turns up.</Review>
            <Review>It's absolutely stuffed with jokes, its pointed criticism of the news media is a natural fit, and the cast is uniformly energized.</Review>
            <Review>A worthy followup to the first film</Review>
            <Review>The unscripted, off-the-cuff joshing between Ferrell and co-stars Paul Rudd, Steve Carell and David Koechner this time fails to come up with enough good jokes, though they do hit the occasional satirical bull's eye.</Review>

        <Duration>85</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Haunted by a traumatic history, photographer Kevin Wolfe struggles to systematically forget all his bad memories, but erasing his past threatens to consume his future. Kevin is obsessed with finding a girl who can help him forget his unpleasant past. However, all his encounters with the opposite sex inevitably go afoul, creating more awkward experiences than he can cope with. As the rejections mount, Kevin's futile search for happiness and love becomes overwhelmingly turbulent, forcing him to take desperate measures. Shot in a variety of NYC locales, from Hell's Kitchen to Greenpoint, Forgetting the Girl is a gritty vision of the city and its denizens. The tightly-woven thriller blends recollections with reality to craft an intense character study of the psychologically-scarred protagonist. As beautiful as it is dark, the tense narrative slowly boils under the surface until it unleashes an unsettling climax that will not be easily forgotten.(c) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>At Middleton is a modest movie with modest aims, but at times it feels like a small miracle.</Review>
            <Review>Some truths about George and Edith's underlying emotional state come out in an unconventional and interesting way, but it's not enough to make us care about the attraction that is drawing them closer.</Review>
            <Review>Garcia and Farmiga, as good as they can be in the right roles, aren't doing themselves or their careers any favors with this sort of C-level effort.</Review>
            <Review>Both Garcia and Farmiga dive head-on into raging rapids of doubt, pain and recrimination.</Review>
            <Review>None of this is particularly innovative, although Garcia and the elder Farmiga develop a nice spark and a gentle humor in their characters' stolen day together.</Review>
            <Review>Garcia and Farmiga's appealing chemistry supplies the pep missing from the limp script and although the prevailing mood is cosily light-hearted, there's a bittersweet undertone to the film.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>85</Duration>
        <StoryLine>In a parallel universe, World War One is imminent as we follow the gripping story of human resistance fighters who march to battle against the second invasion of the Martians. In 1899, the Earth was attacked by ruthless invaders from the planet Mars. The Martians' 80 ft tall, heat-ray spewing, Tripod battle machines laid waste to the planet, but the invaders ultimately fell prey to Earth's tiny bacteria. Fifteen years later, Man has rebuilt his shattered world, in large part by utilizing captured Martian technology. Equipped with giant, steam-powered Tripod battle machines, the international rapid reaction force, is Mankind's first line of defense against the return of the rapacious Martian invaders. And return the Martians do. The rematch finds the multinational battle squad tripod "Goliath" on the front-lines of a vicious interplanetary offensive. This time the Martians are using even more advanced alien technology. In the crucible of combat, the young crew helming the mighty Goliath will be tested to the limits of their endurance and courage as they fight for Mankind's very survival under the onslaught of an implacable enemy.

            <Review>In spite of its enjoyable, easy-to-exploit aspects, "47 Ronin" is a big budget spectacle hamstrung by its need to be at once flippant and respectful of its honor-driven source material.</Review>
            <Review>47 Ronin's biggest shortcoming lies in never relinquishing its real world footing so the visual artistry can intrigue on its own merits.</Review>

        <StoryLine>The year is 1980. The Levis, a large family with a unique lifestyle, live in what was then a rather naive State of Israel. Mr. Levi lectures his children daily on the importance of fulfilling their dreams, while his wife preaches absolute family loyalty. The family's twin boys both fall in love with a new girl in town. Erez, our hero, discovers how difficult it is to balance family loyalty against fulfillment of one's personal dreams. Matters become increasingly complicated when Erez somehow causes a severe family crisis. Beset by guilt feelings, he attempts to escape his fate, somehow exchanging dreams with his twin brother. He is drafted into a commando unit of the Israeli Army, just as his brother always dreamed of doing, while Ofer remains at home to take care of his broken family and has an affair with the love of Erez's life. Can Erez challenge destiny? Of what value is the life of someone who does not fulfill his dreams?</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>A newly single man negotiates the tricky world of dating and internet friendship in the 21st century in this romantic comedy from Chile. Javier (Ariel Levy) is a twenty-something hipster who works in advertising, and for two years was in a seemingly happy relationship with Sofia (Lucy Cominetti). But Javier decided he was growing tired of Sofia and broke up with her; it didn't take long for him to realize that was a mistake, but he's not about to admit it. Since Javier and Sofia are frequent visitors to the same social networking sites and can hardly avoid one another in cyberspace, the two often squabble on line while their friends compare notes on their views of the relationship (most observers decide Javier is being childish). Meanwhile, Javier throws himself back into the dating scene, often with near-disastrous results, while his longtime friend Angela (Andrea Velasco) offers him advice that he usually doesn't have the sense to follow. Fuck My Life (aka Que pena tu vida) received its North American premiere at the 2011 South by Southwest Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>Alan Zweig investigates the history of Jewish culture in America in the 20th Century by showcasing how the humor of the Hebrew people has evolved and stayed the same over a long period of time in his documentary When Jews Were Funny. He interviews a number of prominent and up-and-coming Jewish comics in order to get their opinion on if Jewish culture has fundamentally changed since Zweig was a child. Among the interviewees are David Steinberg, Shecky Greene, Andy Kindler, and Bob Einstein. Also included are vintage television performances by such legends as Alan King and Jackie Mason. When Jews Were Funny screened at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival.</StoryLine>

        <Duration>70</Duration>
        <StoryLine>One of Harold Lloyd's best feature-length comedies, The Freshman, features the bespectacled regular guy as Harold Lamb, a na�ve young man who heads off to college believing campus life will be just as it is in the movies; he even learns a little dance he saw one of his favorite actors do in a film. However, Harold soon discovers that real life isn't all that much like the pictures, and he quickly becomes the laughing stock of the university. Determined to prove himself, Harold tries out for the football team, but he serves as water boy and rides the pine until he finally gets a chance to redeem himself at the big game. Along the way, Harold also tries to woo a lovely co-ed, Peggy (Jobyna Ralston). 22 years later, writer/director Preston Sturges used the climactic football game as the opening for his collaboration with Harold Lloyd, The Sin of Harold Diddlebock.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Lloyd has never been a very good actor; he has been a dummy for comic devices. And we are not much moved by the scene in The Freshman in which he learns at last that he has been the butt of his fellow students, instead of, as he has believed, their hero.</Review>
            <Review>Mr. Lloyd could be funny playing an undisturbed mummy. Simply this: The Freshman is not so funny as earlier of the comedian's adventures.</Review>
            <Review>Lloyd can't compete with Chaplin and Keaton, but he perfectly embodied the can-do energy of the 1920s, and few things are quite as funny as his bespectacled, apple-pie face twisted by a panic that was always justified.</Review>
            <Review>This is a regular Harold Lloyd strip of fun, which is made all the more hilarious by introducing something like suspense in the sequences on the football field.</Review>
            <Review>Lloyd's films are prose where Keaton's were poems, but gag for gag, Lloyd was the funniest screen comic of his time.</Review>
            <Review>The plot is a cliche now, but at the time must have felt fresh. And even though modern viewers have seen its like perhaps dozens of times, it somehow does little to diminish The Freshman's charm.</Review>
            <Review>...another solid comedy film, featuring Lloyd as a naïve character who just wants to be popular at "Tate University," described in a title card as "a large football stadium with a college attached."</Review>
            <Review>In a comedy of emulation, idolizing and popularity, the flimsy mannequins of maleness stand out as Lloyd gives the old college try to becoming a fresh man by being a stale model.</Review>
            <Review>A treasure that still stands as one of the greatest comedies ever made.</Review>
            <Review>there is not a college-themed cinematic yukfest that doesn't owe something to Lloyd's standard-bearer--the original revenge of the nerd</Review>
            <Review>Flawlessly executed and edited for maximum impact, the gags have timepiece precision, but Lloyd always sells his mishaps as things that just kind of happen to his character [The Freshman] works because it keeps viewers rooting for its hero.</Review>
            <Review>My first foray into the comedic world of Harold Lloyd yielded eerily similar results to my initial exposure to W.C. Fields.</Review>

        <Duration>122</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Brenda Bakke may play a character named "Alison McKenzie", but the independently produced Twogether is no Peyton Place. Bakke and Nick Cassavetes (son of John Cassavetes and Gena Rowlands) play a couple of well-buffed Californians who spend virtually all their time at Venice Beach. Brenda and Nick fight a whole lot, and make love a whole lot more. A pregnancy results, forcing the couple to move in together-and to find out that lust and love are two separate commodities. If there's any more plot than that, it was evidently washed away with the shifting sands. Even the sight of naked, gleaming young bodies begins to pall after a while, especially since Twogether crawls along for 122 minutes. If you feel like dozing, just close your eyes and luxuriate in the film's pulsating rock-music score.</StoryLine>

        <Duration>98</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Hulk Hogan, in an inarguably appropriate casting choice, plays a professional wrestler in this action-packed drama. Rip (Hogan) is a grappling star who is approached by Brell (Kurt Fuller), the new head of the World Television Network. Brell wants Rip to wrestle on his network, but Rip insists on honoring his commitment to another outlet. Brell responds by launching a show called "Battle of the Tough Guys," in which the beefy regulars of a particularly rough drinking establishment fight each other on camera. Zeus (Tom "Tiny" Lister Jr.) soon emerges as the bad guy champion on this new show, and Brell uses Rip's friendship with his assistant Samantha (Joan Severance) to arrange a bout between Zeus and Rip. Rip is not at all interested until Zeus injures his brother and makes the fight a matter of personal pride. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>Racist, misogynist, dumb, sadistic, lazy and tiresome, the film is about a big bout between a huge heroic white guy and a huge villainous black guy.</Review>
            <Review>The final showdown between Rip and Zeus is overlong and full of uninspired wrestling stunts. The camera crews of the World Wrestling Federation do a much better job.</Review>
            <Review>While wrestling fans surely will queue up to see their boy win the day, No Holds Barred is just a sweaty headlock of a film, with dreary, gory scenes and a bunch of slope-headed hokum to propel it.</Review>
            <Review>Some may find the cartoonish violence excessive; the champion Tough Guy can't be anyone but a good guy, but that doesn't stop him from doling out to his enemies a very painful punishment.</Review>
            <Review>Barred is tremendously crude, unapologetically manipulative (Zeus finally breaks down Rip's reserve by crippling his kid brother), and aimed directly at easily entertained 13-year-old boys.</Review>

        <StoryLine>We first meet 33 year old Jack Hall in the midst of an exciting transitional period for him. Diagnosed with mental illness at the age of 19, he's had some rough times over the years. But, having gone through dozens of arrests and hospitalizations, he's brought himself to a point where he has a steady job, a stable place to live, has achieved a high level of recovery in his illness, and is ready to move on.

            <Review>Oliver is off to a promising start. Let's hope it's enough to get his next go-round a wider theatrical release.</Review>
            <Review>This movingly understated drama benefits from strong performances and incisive characterizations.</Review>
            <Review>With awkward slow-motion effects, clunky transitions and pregnant zooms that seem conspicuously in the wrong speed or otherwise a little off, Mr. Oliver's film aims for a glossy mainstream aesthetic without the budget or skills to match.</Review>
            <Review>The great achievement in writer-director Jono Oliver's poignant, superb debut, "Home," lies in the balance between the film's empathy for those like Jack who seek independence and its compassion for others who may need care indefinitely.</Review>
            <Review>The casting director needs a raise.</Review>
            <Review>The affecting and low-key drama skips past the usual dramatic scenes of someone who has suffered a psychotic breakdown, instead showing us the quieter but more convincing struggle of someone trying to piece his life back together afterwards.</Review>
            <Review>Remains character-driven throughout and doesn't have a moment that rings false, pretentious or contrived. Gbenga Akinnagbe gives a genuinely heartfelt performance. If there were any justice, he'd get some awards attention.</Review>
            <Review>A smart, engaging and superbly acted indie drama that knows and shows its title can be not just a physical place but a state of settled mind.</Review>

        <StoryLine>When two young filmmakers select a crazed conspiracy theorist as the subject of their new movie, they have no idea the terrifying peril they will put themselves in. When the man disappears without a trace, the filmmakers begin an obsessive quest to uncover the truth that will lead them to an ancient and dangerous secret society.

            <Review>The Conspiracy does more with a found-footage conceit than any horror movie since The Blair Witch Project.</Review>
            <Review>Why do so many contemporary filmmakers use the well-worn device of found footage and documentary shooting style to make thrillers? Does The Blair Witch Project have a mysterious power over all of them?</Review>
            <Review>Continually surprises and engages the viewer even when it's falling apart.</Review>
            <Review>A satisfying found-footage spooker.</Review>
            <Review>As both a compelling examination of conspiracy theorists and a unique found footage film, The Conspiracy lays firm groundwork before delivering a tense, dynamic third act.</Review>
            <Review>Like any good conspiracy theorist (or perhaps Grand Master of the Universe), MacBride rewrites the cosmos, forcing us either to buy the particular reality that he's peddling, or to risk being cast as collusive shills or sacrificial 'sheeples'.</Review>
            <Review>The Conspiracy walks like a doc and talks like a doc, but don't be fooled; it's actually a clever piece of fiction. At least, given the subject matter, I hope that's all it is.</Review>

            <Review>The only solace from the uninspired characters and crammed-in factoids are the gags about poop and puke - juvenile, yes, but also appropriate for the film's "back to nature" ethos.</Review>
            <Review>You'd think it'd be hard to screw up a movie about dinosaurs, and yet Hollywood keeps doing so.</Review>
            <Review>A film that is not so much bad-although it is quite bad-as it is utterly inexplicable.</Review>
            <Review>Walking With Dinosaurs is too good a visual treat to miss, especially if you catch the 3-D version. But don't expect to enjoy the predictable, paper-thin story.</Review>
            <Review>You could write "Walking With Dinosaurs'' off as harmless filler for the under-5 set, except that the only female dinosaur, Juniper, exists solely to moon over Patchi, who as a hatchling lost part of an ear to a winged predator.</Review>
            <Review>The problem isn't the animation, which has been accomplished and, at times, jaw-dropping. It's the concepts and the writing.</Review>
            <Review>All narration and childish fart jokes should've been removed from this movie, and then, perhaps the children in the audience would actually learn something.</Review>
            <Review>"(A)beautifully animated but plot-thin kids film that borrows heavily in the story department from both the Land Before Time and Ice Age movies, as well as various Disney animated classics."</Review>
            <Review>Walking with Dinosaurs 3D has gorgeous, meticulously detailed CGI, but also way too many stupid jokes about poop and puke.</Review>
            <Review>I realize scientists can't prove dinosaurs didn't communicate telepathically, but I suspect the filmmakers' decision to go telepathic stems more from financial concerns than artistic or scientific ones.</Review>
            <Review>Some of the character transformations are rushed (such as that of Patchi's older brother) and I don't quite think there's enough here to keep youngsters entertained.</Review>

            <Review>For three hours the movie operates at a ridiculous comedic pitch. You never forget you're at the circus. You never lose site of the lawlessness, the reckless pleasure, the sheer lunacy and lack of regulation.</Review>

            <Review>If one watches this film and thinks Scorsese has crafted it to exculpate rather than expose the behavior of Jordan Belfort ... well, one has rather missed the point.</Review>
            <Review>How half-brained masculine and economic mentalities are channeled to a mutual, logical, terrible climax in one of the year's more terrifying final shots is what's truly essential.</Review>
            <Review>Scorsese is fascinated by procedure, by drawing back the curtain and showing us how things happen, though he keeps the picture nimble and entertaining enough to avoid burying himself in the minutiae.</Review>
            <Review>DiCaprio makes Belfort a childish charmer, sleazy and arrogant.</Review>
            <Review>Leonardo DiCaprio is a nuclear bomb as Belfort, the actor basking in the ridiculousness of his surroundings and eclipsing them at every turn.</Review>
            <Review>[Belfort is] in the wrong. That's for sure. But to walk away and not realize we're at least a little complicit, too, would be foolhardy.</Review>

            <Review>It's the music, though, including a wealth of galvanic performance footage from the Bikinis, particularly, that really makes this worth seeing. It's killer stuff indeed.</Review>
            <Review>It is not the most subtly layered documentary I've ever seen, but these days it's no longer verboten to take a stance in docs. And there is so much to be admired about Hanna.</Review>
            <Review>The way Hanna burst onto the scene is just as interesting as how she faded from it.</Review>
            <Review>The movie succeeds as a punk chronicle by focusing on a true believer who was lionized by many but who turned out to be only human.</Review>
            <Review>"The Punk Singer" is a revealing look at Hanna's life, who throughout the film is willing to speak out about her struggles and triumphs in an open and honest way.</Review>
            <Review>Where are the riot-grrrls of today? Take your daughters to the movie, then ask them.</Review>
            <Review>Both a captivating personal story and a history of a moment - as the best rock documentaries are.</Review>
            <Review>The Punk Singer is as much a document of Kathleen Hanna's career as it is a public explanation for the truth behind her early retirement.</Review>
            <Review>The Punk Singer works ... as an eye-witness account of an important movement in feminist art; it's a film as vibrant and as vital as [Hanna's] music.</Review>
            <Review>This hagiographic ode to the quintessential 90s riot grrrl is by no means definitive, but there's a welcome rallying cry to all wannabe revolutionary rockers hidden within the bio-doc blather.</Review>
            <Review>...perhaps there is an inherent contradiction in attempting to capture a democratizing movement through an individual figure, as rocktastic and badass as that figure might be.</Review>

            <Review>Jason Osder's stunning debut documentary offers a disturbing look at a forgotten tragedy.</Review>
            <Review>[Osder] cuts between news footage of the events as they unfurled and testimony from hearings held afterward to create a stark, nonjudgmental portrait of an incident that probably needn't have happened.</Review>
            <Review>"Let the Fire Burn" offers a searing picture of how dumb and dangerous humans can be.</Review>
            <Review>It's scary as both a movie and a still-reverberating moment in time.</Review>
            <Review>Brilliantly edited, the film moves back and forth in time, first tracking the events leading up to the confrontation through news reports of the day.</Review>
            <Review>[This historic footage -- from newsreels, TV stations once-live coverage, from several investigating commissions -- has been edited, brilliantly into a coherent, important political film.</Review>
            <Review>It's a remarkably evenhanded telling of a story in which there could be no winners, using archival footage alone.</Review>
            <Review>Let The Fire Burn is an incendiary documentary that uses archival footage to weave a compelling, all-important tale of tragedy bred from anger and misunderstanding.</Review>
            <Review>Apart from the score and the very occasional basic intertitle to help us along, all we see and hear is footage from the day. We're immersed in the present of this world.</Review>

            <Review>In the end, so much of The Past just doesn't have that crucial ring of truth to it. Disappointing and underwhelming.</Review>
            <Review>Farhadi has pulled off the dysfunctional family mystery trick twice now, brilliantly, and perhaps three times in a row would be too much. But it's doubtful he will leave behind the fertile ground of family ties and modern messiness. He sees so much there.</Review>
            <Review>"The Past" is long and occasionally feels slow - as real life sometimes does - but never false.</Review>
            <Review>Farhadi is the rare director who can establish an atmosphere of intimacy that resonates with meaning and sentiment.</Review>
            <Review>What a teller of domestic truths Asghar Farhadi has become.</Review>
            <Review>The Past is about people who wish they could erase what came before and just live in the now, but life doesn't let anyone off the hook that easily.</Review>
            <Review>The revelations Farhadi relies on to propel the story are not as compelling as he gives them credit.</Review>
            <Review>One of the most impressive things about Farhadi's film is the way he reveals facts about the tale and his extraordinary timing in which he reveals them. The movie unfolds like a surprise birthday gift.</Review>
            <Review>Um filme povoado por pessoas que tentam encontrar sentido onde não há nenhum.</Review>
            <Review>It's a testament to Farhadi that I could even consider a movie as good as 'The Past' to be any kind of disappointment.</Review>
            <Review>This slim and pretty terrific thriller may just prove to be the ultimate antidote to this summer's bloated superhero onslaught.</Review>
            <Review>Farhadi's most thrilling gift, which seems innate and intuitive, is in demonstrating how figures move, are framed by frames, reflected by surfaces, going beyond elementary considerations, describing a vital mathematics of humans in motion.</Review>

            <Review>The Great Beauty is an utterly ravishing portrait of listless luxuriance, a fantasy of decadent wealth and beauty that evokes Fellini's La Dolce Vita by way of Baz Luhrmann.</Review>
            <Review>Celebrating Rome in all its decay, this florid comedy by Paolo Sorrentino (Il Divo, This Must Be the Place) opens with a hyperbolically gaudy party honoring a celebrity journalist on his 65th birthday.</Review>
            <Review>A riotous film that finds depth, clarity and refreshment in even the shallowest of pools.</Review>
            <Review>Throughout the film, Sorrentino delivers gorgeous images, crazy images, startling and sexy and serene images; it's a visual bath of sorts - the great beauty is everywhere, Jep (and we) just have to be open to it.</Review>
            <Review>Though there's precious little drama, Sorrentino's skills as an image-maker are indisputable.</Review>
            <Review>It's a beauty, all right. It's more a style show than a deep philosophical treatise, but with surfaces this sleek and faces this interesting, I'll take style over substance any day.</Review>
            <Review>A richly symbolic meditation on aging, mortality and precious time wasted.</Review>
            <Review>Sometimes too overblown, surreal and obtuse for its own good, director Paolo Sorrentino's film is nonetheless an exquisitely composed portrait of vapidity and decline.</Review>
            <Review>Exceptional, mature film dazzles, offers haunting insights.</Review>
            <Review>"The Great Beauty" is a great romance: a man and a city and a love that cannot be consummated but which will consume you surely. Somewhere, Baz Luhrmann weeps.</Review>
            <Review>If it sounds a bit ponderous, well, maybe it is, but it's also smart, warm-hearted and sumptuously shot.</Review>
            <Review>The film reflects the grandiose ambitions of the city it dissects while slyly reflecting on not only the future of Italy but also on the history of the country's cinema.</Review>

            <Review>A golden comic premise, directed to dross by Ken Scott, who also made the Canadian original ("Starbuck," from 2011) on which this Vince Vaughn vehicle is based.</Review>
            <Review>Softer and schmaltzier than the original. Vince Vaughn has played this guy before, to better effect.</Review>
            <Review>Calling Delivery Man a "comedy" is a bit of a stretch, because it's rarely funny. Dumb, yes, but not in a way that's worthy of more than a half-hearted chuckle.</Review>
            <Review>Delivery Man can be pegged as yet another in a seemingly endless series of Apatow-era man-child redemption stories ...</Review>
            <Review>"Starbuck" was a funny and warm-hearted trifle. So is "Delivery Man."</Review>
            <Review>Vaughn never quite convinces as the perpetual slacker in this blue-collar family (he doesn't even look like he's from the same gene pool) and too many of the characters feel puppeteered into place; you can see all the strings.</Review>
            <Review>While the story drags at times, Delivery Man is smart, funny, fresh and full of heart.</Review>
            <Review>Vaughn fans will find enough laughs to justify the two hours, but the tonal issues will make it a hard sell for anyone else.</Review>
            <Review>Stiff but tolerable.</Review>
            <Review>Delivery Man has a beginning, a middle and an end. And, for modern Hollywood, a pertinent everyman story to tell, too.</Review>
            <Review>The sheer cognitive dissonance between being told that this character is nice and the baffling deception he pulls on hundreds of people is agonizing, and it makes the story horribly anti-dramatic.</Review>
            <Review>'Delivery Man' is a little like the main character: just good enough to make you care a little and smile a lot.</Review>
