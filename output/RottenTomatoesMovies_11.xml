            <Review>A would-be thriller whose intended horror-tinged chills register as ho-hum hokum.</Review>
            <Review>"The Condemned" is nothing but a creaky façade.</Review>
            <Review>You may hopefully think you're watching an art-film pastiche along the witty avant-garde lines of something by the Chilean director Raúl Ruiz.</Review>
            <Review>A Puerto Rican drama that straddles the line between (tame) horror movie and (marginal) ghost story.</Review>
            <Review>So tame and so completely boring that to call it a horror film is to insult the genre.</Review>
            <Review>Despite a lavish dose of gothic style (and the occasional inspired flourish, as when surveillance monitors are overcome with home movies of dead children), The Condemned's trek toward absolution is pretty familiar.</Review>
            <Review>If you like psychological/supernatural thrillers that are relentlessly grim and creepy, this is recommended. Others who like their horror to be at least a little on the fun side may find this just numbing.</Review>
            <Review>It adds up to a methodically bland, intellectually sluggish exercise in guilt-tripping that's nonetheless still more interested in its rich and sexy characters than the supposed unfortunates.</Review>

Ilham, an assassin who is also Adil's stepbrother, is promptly hired by the organizer of the death match to kill the fugitive. Looking for somewhere to hide and recover, Adil and a childhood friend take shelter in the Bunohan boxing club where Adil started his career. Ilham, meanwhile, has never been back to Bunohan since the day he left many years ago. Upon returning, memories of loneliness and abandonment flood his mind, and he experiences waves of resentment and regret. Bakar, the third brother, has also come home from the city; ostensibly a respectful schoolteacher, he is in reality a greedy and ruthless person, and is trying to convince his father to sell a burial ground to a construction company.</StoryLine>

            <Review>A playful paean to a movie genre and a prolific career, Ernest Borgnine's valedictory feature is a spaghetti western with a heavy helping of cheese.</Review>

            <Review>The movie is a psalm to those who, far from pursuing the path of the Rolling Stones, stayed trapped under a rock.</Review>
            <Review>This film could have been -- should have been, even -- something special. But it's not.</Review>
            <Review>The period details are spot-on and the soundtrack is great.</Review>
            <Review>Yes, it's about rock and New Jersey, but it's also about getting a life going and dreaming, and that's timeless, classic stuff.</Review>
            <Review>Well-observed but occasionally disjointed, it's a film that's more about thematic tone, sound and images than it is driven by plot.</Review>
            <Review>There are plenty of laughs along with the melodrama as the band and its members struggle through young adulthood.</Review>
            <Review>There's a nice, pop-in-and-see rhythm to the storytelling. Gandolfini's Pat descends into a rich sadness. There's wry humour to be had with Douglas and his idealizing buddies. Loneliness and longing lounge around together.</Review>

            <Review>Sopranos creator David Chase returns to New Jersey, but his film loses its way</Review>

            <Review>Such a feature-length bludgeoning, even in the service of basic social and scientific literacy, is truly discomfiting.</Review>
            <Review>Offers a balanced view of the fight over science and U.S. history standards for Texas schools, but lacks the punch it might have achieved with a stronger point of view.</Review>
            <Review>Scott Thurman's new film The Revisionaries is a postcard from the frontline of America's culture wars.</Review>

            <Review>Scott Thurman captures not only the fear and anti-intellectual resentment and insecurity that govern the dictations of the far right, but also the rampant unchecked egotism.</Review>
            <Review>At once an unsettling documentary and an enlightening one.</Review>
            <Review>This doc's look at the avid Texas State Board of Education (led by a smalltown dentist), invested in rewriting school textbooks in order to push ultra-right wing agendas, is a disturbing must-see.</Review>

            <Review>If you're in the mood for some slick trash featuring great actors slumming it without phoning it in, "Broken City" is a crackling good time.</Review>
            <Review>Most of the roles are so ambiguous you end up scratching your head in the final reel, and some of the loose ends are so irrelevant they seem to have ended up on the cutting-room floor.</Review>

            <Review>Writer-director Russell is just the guy to bring out (and then calm) the manic dysfunction in these folks.</Review>
            <Review>It's a rom-com that succeeds in revitalizing that discredited genre where so many others have failed, injecting it with the grit and emotion of realist drama rather than with amped-up whimsy or social satire or montages of people walking on the beach.</Review>
            <Review>Silver Linings Playbook tells us that happily-ever-after may depend on finding people who coexist with our lunacy, not ones who can lead us out of it. In any case, it's crazy good.</Review>
            <Review>A crazy beaut of a comedy that brims with generosity and manages to circumvent predictability at every turn.</Review>
            <Review>An edgy romantic dramedy that suits our anxious times.</Review>
            <Review>This meaningful film keeps the laughs, giddy anxiousness and warm butterflies from the trailer and sustains it all through two full hours of a love story.</Review>
            <Review>Silver Linings Playbook gives us four performers to relish.</Review>
            <Review>It's a challenging picture, but it runs the gamut of emotions so well that it's nearly impossible to dislike.</Review>
            <Review>Wouldn't it be great if mental illness really was as adorable as it is in the movies?</Review>
            <Review>"Silver Linings Playbook" makes comic hay from bipolar illness, early death, sexual adventurism, self-improvement binges, football fanaticism, degenerate gambling and father-son estrangement, as one would expect from latter-day Russell movies.</Review>
            <Review>But Silver Linings Playbook never induces a roll of the eyes, even if it never really surprises.</Review>
            <Review>In an age when the concept of comedies about possible kinships between characters is dominated by sugary devices and contrivance, here at last is a movie about real situations, real people and the natural experiences that evolve from them.</Review>

            <Review>Rogen and Streisand are reasonably funny together, though Rogen, always best when he's angry, is crowded into the role of a well-mannered straight man.</Review>

But, when a family of hungry raccoons ransacks their perfectly manicured backyard, Jeff becomes single-mindedly obsessed with eradicating the pests by any means necessary. Soon the relentless rodents aren't merely uprooting the lawn, but also overturning the Langs' entire bourgeois existence, as the man-versus-beast battle leads into an absurd mess of infidelity, extortion, organ donation and other assorted mayhem. -- (C) Radius TWC</StoryLine>

            <Review>"The Details" is not just entertaining, but potentially useful.</Review>
            <Review>As the title suggests, it's all in the details, which writer-director Estes provides in large if not always convincing doses.</Review>
            <Review>It's hard to make a fine actress like Laura Linney look off-key and shrill, but "The Details" manages to do just that. It's hardly an accomplishment.</Review>
            <Review>"The Details" cancels itself out by being too campy to take seriously and too tragic to laugh at.</Review>
            <Review>"The Details" wears its quirky heart on its sleeve, signaling (and smirking at) its own silliness, at every opportunity, with an intrusively antic score that makes everything sound like a giant joke.</Review>
            <Review>It all adds up to create a dicey morality tale that's as improbable as it is strangely believable.</Review>
            <Review>Everything here is intentionally grotesque to service the filmmaker's cheap shots. Women and black people are just plain crazy.</Review>
            <Review>Despite some tonal stumbles, the film mostly finds its footing and becomes an enjoyable comic enterprise.</Review>
            <Review>a painfully dull slog through an exceedingly stupid subdivision</Review>
            <Review>The script is somewhat provocative in its examination of relationships during absurd circumstances, but its twists eventually become less compelling.</Review>
            <Review>Estes never seems to find the balance between dark farce and existential drama, and the cast - especially the goofy Maguire - is left trying to sort it all out.</Review>
            <Review>There are a few highlights worth a look and an accomplished supporting cast to ease the oddity along, yet The Details doesn't add up to much despite its rather elaborate design of misery.</Review>

        <Title>The Enforcer</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 1951</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>87</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Humphrey Bogart plays Martin Ferguson, a prosecutor about to put Albert Mendoza (Everett Sloane), the head of a murder-for-hire ring, on trial. But the night before the trial, his key witness, Joe Rico (Ted de Corsia), dies in a fall out of the window of the room in which he's been guarded, part of an abortive escape attempt to keep from testifying. His case in shambles, Ferguson and detective Captain Nelson (Roy Roberts) try to piece the entire four-year investigation back together from square one, trying to find something that might give them another way to prosecute Mendoza. The main body of the movie is told in flashback, starting when a small-time hood named Duke Malloy (Michael Tolan, then billed as Lawrence Tolan) walks into a police station to turn himself in for killing his girlfriend -- and says that someone made him kill her. He babbles to the bewildered detectives about "hits" and "contracts" and men nicknamed Philadelphia, Big Babe, and Smiley. The body isn't found, but they arrest Malloy, who hangs himself in his cell. That dead end leads, almost by accident, to Philadelphia Tom Zaca (Jack Lambert), an asylum inmate who has to be put under sedation at the mention of Malloy's name. They find another suspect's body burning in his building's incinerator, and then Big Babe Lazick (Zero Mostel), a two-bit hood, hiding in a church in mortal fear of his life. He begins weaving a tale of a murder-by-contract ring and its head operator, Joe Rico, of a murder contract that Duke Malloy never filled on a girl who had to change her name, of mistaken identity and the murder of the girl's cab-driver father, and the connection between that and a murder that they both witnessed eight years earlier. In the midst of all of those interlocking stories (spread across ten years), there's something Ferguson missed -- when he had Rico to testify -- that he has to sort out from the reams of testimony and evidence, and he has to figure it out before Mendoza does, or lose the last witness he has. ~ Bruce Eder, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <ReleaseDate> 2012</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>104</Duration>
        <StoryLine>An 8-year-old boy dedicates his life to helping children rendered homeless by Hurricane Charley, and learns that you can't put a price tag on life's greatest gifts in this inspirational drama based on actual events. Dejected at the images of families whose lives were uprooted by the disaster, Zach Bonner uses his trusty wagon to collect essential items that will help them get back on their feet. When the media spotlight's Zach's benevolent endeavors, the selfless seizes the opportunity to launch his own charity, dubbed the Little Red Wagon Foundation. Later, Zach encounters a widow and her son who were rendered homeless by the story, and vows to draw attention to their plight by embarking on a cross country walk. Despite his mother's trepidations about the journey and his teenage sister's growing resentment over being stuck at the center of a media circus, Zach sets out on a journey that will transform not just his own life, but also the lives of everyone he encounters. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>There's weighty material waiting to be processed here, but in "Little Red Wagon" it doesn't have a home.</Review>
            <Review>Even the cheesiest inspirational flicks have to be populated with characters who have something at stake. Conflict is the heart of good storytelling, and "Little Red Wagon" is conflict-free to the point of catatonia.</Review>
            <Review>Inspiring story of a boy's efforts to help homeless kids.</Review>
            <Review>A double whammy about the crusade of a big-hearted boy who helps homeless children and a depiction of the plunge of a mother and her son into poverty.</Review>
            <Review>Well-intentioned, but a little heavy-handed and manipulative.</Review>
            <Review>The melodramatic storyline and moralizing tone are overbearing, and only O'Connor's performance rises above the level of a Hallmark Channel rerun.</Review>
            <Review>Not many 14-year-olds have movies made about their lives. Zach Bonner is an exception, always has been, and that's why Little Red Wagon is such a sweetly inspiring story.... It's a nice movie, probably too much so for viewers seeking meatier drama.</Review>
            <Review>Poorly executed heartwarming beats aside, Little Red Wagon does an excellent job of showing how a charity grows and functions.</Review>
            <Review>"Little Red Wagon" almost seems better suited for a made-for-TV, Lifetime movie.</Review>
            <Review>The filmmakers never sentimentalize their story and the performances are first-rate. What could be cloying is played out honestly... and not just its good intentions.</Review>

            <Review>It shamelessly rips off much better animated movies. What kind of lesson is that for our young people?</Review>
            <Review>The film is without wit and, sadly, entirely forgettable.</Review>
            <Review>Blandly unremarkable.</Review>
            <Review>Although its message is never subtle, Delhi Safari is fun enough to earn the right to preach.</Review>
            <Review>Out-of-date animation throws up a roadblock for this Indian animated 3D family film.</Review>
            <Review>...so many similarities [to The Lion King] you begin to wonder how they got away with it.</Review>
            <Review>The "Save the Environment" and "Share the World" themes of "Delhi Safari" will keep the adults involved in this nice story that is chock full of snappy, nature-friendly songs that will delight the kids.</Review>
            <Review>Bollywood numbers can't save derivative wild-animal tale.</Review>
            <Review>Going to the zoo, watching Animal Planet or reading National Geographic will be more enlightening than this. (Full Content Review for Parents also available)</Review>
            <Review>...U.S. audiences, at least, are bound to find the animation here subpar for a theatrical release.</Review>
            <Review>Although set in India, the Bollywood-backed cartoon Delhi Safari speaks the universal language of middling kiddie entertainment.</Review>

            <Review>The film's sexual intelligence is undone by a paralyzing voice-over and an encroaching case of the blahs.</Review>
            <Review>The young actors' vacant-eyed brazenness may be true to life, but there's a whiff of exploitation, matched by the script's disinterest in exploring any friction that isn't skin on skin.</Review>
            <Review>A film that respects sex and the emotional consequences that follow once the heat wears off. It also is not a condemnation piece about religion even as it calmly exposes the hypocrisies of suppressing the natural order in order to let go of one's ego.</Review>
