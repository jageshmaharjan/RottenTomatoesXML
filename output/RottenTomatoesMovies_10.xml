            <Review>The Godfather it's not, but this had more vigor and immediacy than either Youth Against Youth or Tetro.</Review>
            <Review>Easily [Coppola's] silliest work ever.</Review>
            <Review>É lamentável que estas experiências estéticas e narrativas estejam se revelando dignas de um adolescente que não só está segurando uma câmera pela primeira vez como ainda sabe pouquíssimo sobre os gêneros nos quais tenta investir.</Review>
            <Review>'Twixt' is not unwatchable, but it comes close.</Review>
            <Review>Sometimes it's fascinating, but just as often, it's frustrating: It's a film without a net, and it tends to land with a thud.</Review>
            <Review>surreal, phoned in, and hostile toward its audience</Review>
            <Review>As much as the budget appears to have been a constraint on the effects of the film, it shouldn't have affected the acting or coherency of the picture.</Review>
            <Review>Not a very good movie, but a weirdly interesting one for the serious horror fans.</Review>
            <Review>Interesting shotgun blast of ideas and moods, and while it doesn't braid together as evenly as Coppola might've hoped, the picture maintains a full punch of atmosphere, while giving its star something substantial to play.</Review>
            <Review>A heady brew of fever dreams, absurd nightmares, and impotent despair</Review>
            <Review>Francis Ford Coppola is in a playful mood.</Review>

            <Review>[Dierctor Jorge] Hinojosa does a good job of showing Iceberg's humanity without glossing over the viciousness of his chosen profession.</Review>
            <Review>The film succeeds as an introduction to Beck the writer but is undercut by its lack of gritty details.</Review>
            <Review>The film is weighed down by the testimony of bespectacled professors from hip critical studies and English departments and a psychologist, who describe Mr. Beck's biography without the punch and lyricism of his prose.</Review>
            <Review>Intentions and effect are at odds throughout Jorge Hinojosa's one-note documentary Iceberg Slim: Portrait of a Pimp ...</Review>
            <Review>Beck's widow, his ex-wife and three daughters paint the man as someone whose success only complicated his life, estranging him from his family and eventually saddling him with crippling inertia.</Review>
            <Review>Intentions and effect are at odds throughout Jorge Hinojosa's one-note documentary Iceberg Slim: Portrait of a Pimp.</Review>
            <Review>Docu admires and glamorizes pimping with celeb interviews.</Review>
            <Review>The question of how deep a scumbag's amends must run hangs uneasily over the entire movie, which awkwardly straddles the line between amiable hagiography and a more discerning sociological study.</Review>
            <Review>After an unpromising beginning, Iceberg Slim develops into a thorny, engaging exploration of the strange twilight and late-in-life fame of a bona fide American outlaw.</Review>
            <Review>It certainly threatens to succumb to hero worship, but Jorge Hinojosa wisely subverts Slim's mythos by pulling the curtain back on it in the doc's second half by revealing the man beneath.</Review>
            <Review>Taken as an in-depth confessional it's fine, but yet another bad mommy blame game on screen. And an odd counterpoint to the explosive, horrific revelations of the many sex trafficking documentaries proliferating out there.</Review>
            <Review>If the subject interests you, buy and read a couple of Iceberg's books. This film is for entertainment only, although there is substantial entertainment to be had.</Review>

        <Title>Koch</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>95</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Former Mayor Ed Koch is the quintessential New Yorker. Still ferocious, charismatic, and hilariously blunt, the now 87-year-old Koch ruled New York from 1978 to 1989-a down-and-dirty decade of grit, graffiti, near-bankruptcy and rampant crime. First-time filmmaker (and former Wall Street Journal reporter) Neil Barsky has crafted an intimate and revealing portrait of this intensely private man, his legacy as a political titan, and the town he helped transform. The tumult of his three terms included a fiercely competitive 1977 election; an infamous 1980 transit strike; the burgeoning AIDS epidemic; landmark housing renewal initiatives; and an irreparable municipal corruption scandal. Through candid interviews and rare archival footage, Koch thrillingly chronicles the personal and political toll of running the world's most wondrous city in a time of upheaval and reinvention.

        <Reviews>
            <Review>He was certainly combative, and confident, and full of love for the city he governed with such gusto. Koch is a New York story for the whole world to appreciate.</Review>
            <Review>What he really was was one of a kind. Whether intentionally or not, "Koch" shows that that's not necessarily a bad thing.</Review>
            <Review>An emphasis on Koch the character obscures his administration.</Review>
            <Review>Though the film, more than two years in the making, was never intended as such, it plays like the kind of eulogy Koch would have approved - neither fawning nor eviscerating but always compelling.</Review>
            <Review>The film advances no theories to explain his contradictions, only a thrilling, sometimes affecting account of what he did.</Review>
            <Review>"How'm I doin'?" Koch famously asked anyone and everyone he passed by, rarely hanging around for the answer. In "Koch," for the most part, he does all right.</Review>
            <Review>Both as a portrait of a changing New York City and the man who was at the epicentre of that evolution for over a decade, Koch is a delight.</Review>
            <Review>An engaging if incomplete portrait of an unconventional politician.</Review>
            <Review>Forget "A Tale of Two Cities:" - the documentary "Koch" is a tale of two mayors. At LEAST two.</Review>
            <Review>The film neither glorifies nor vilifies. Instead, it treats triumphs and controversies with equal balance.</Review>
            <Review>A fascinating, multi-faceted look at a very complicated man, a quintessential New Yorker who was both an uncommonly skilled politician and, at times, a tremendous jerk.</Review>
            <Review>The gift of Koch is that it embraces the clutter and volume of opinion about the man.</Review>

            <Review>This is realism that enlarges our conception of the term.</Review>
            <Review>Now at the end of the year comes a masterpiece, not just the best of the year, but one of the best ever: Michael Haneke's Amour.</Review>
            <Review>Trintignant perfectly captures the resolve that eventually borders on obsession, as the woman he loves gradually, maddeningly, disappears before his eyes, and he does whatever he can to prevent it, though he knows it's impossible.</Review>
            <Review>Many viewers will find echoes of their grandparents, parents, or even themselves in these characters.</Review>
            <Review>A movie that is utterly worthy of its all-encompassing title.</Review>
            <Review>The resulting interplay of ruthless restraint and unavoidable passion, plus the film's refusal to shrink from depicting the inevitable horrors of physical deterioration, is devastating.</Review>
            <Review>I can't say you'll enjoy Amour. That would be an inappropriate reaction, in fact. Hollywood has conditioned us to expect swelling violins as characters draw close to death. (Here) there's little drama and nothing in the way of ceremony.</Review>
            <Review>Beautifully shot, powerfully acted, and skillfully composed, Amour is worth pursuing.</Review>
            <Review>Does what it sets out to do, expertly weaving together the monotony of everyday life, the nauseating horror of mortality, and the most esoteric corners of the human mind.</Review>
            <Review>It's a chilling, pitiless vision that offers no relief, just a portrait of decline.</Review>
            <Review>Michael Haneke's profound new film Amour is far from your standard Hollywood romance. It is also a more nuanced, challenging and thought-provoking experience than that one word might lead you to believe.</Review>
            <Review>Amour is a brutally difficult viewing experience, but it's in no way a film you'll desire -- or be able -- to forget.</Review>

            <Review>For a film about the apocalypse, Matheson's script felt a little bit too bland and mundane. Who would have thought the rapture could be so boring?</Review>
            <Review>In a post-South Park world, lazy execution of a ribald, potentially controversial concept will not suffice -- especially not when the apocalypse is being handled with much more wit, vim and verve just across the megaplex.</Review>
            <Review>Rapture-Palooza is a film worth sticking though as the third act goes for broke and delivers many of the story's biggest laughs, ending far stronger than it started.</Review>
            <Review>Judgment day comedy is low on laughs, high on raunchy jokes.</Review>

            <Review>It's supposed to be funny, but you'd have an easier time reading a zombie's pulse than you would finding a single good laugh ...</Review>
            <Review>For the art-house crowd, who may, I suppose, stumble drunk into the wrong theater after too much Chardonnay, there are nods to Black Swan and 127 Hours.</Review>
            <Review>A film composed almost entirely of jokes that were much funnier when you read them on Twitter years ago.</Review>
            <Review>Like so much of this whole series, the mere mention of a familiar pop culture figure or title is supposed to be hilarious.</Review>
            <Review>Scary Movie 5 must be some kind of psychological experiment. Perhaps the filmmakers sat in a lab, rubbing their temples while wondering aloud how awful they could make a movie and still score at the box office.</Review>
            <Review>Every penny that "Scary Movie V" earns is cinematic blood money, looted from the pockets of unsuspecting moviegoers.</Review>
            <Review>The writers are on auto pilot once more, relying on the "It's familiar, so it must be funny" routine...</Review>
            <Review>Scary Movie 5 is a reprehensible excuse of a comedy and should barely be considered a film since it's of such poor quality. They don't make a dunce cap big enough for individuals this idiotic.</Review>
            <Review>Railing against Scary Movie V for diminishing the series' standards would be as effective as criticising Brooke Hogan for disgracing her proud family name. And yet, the fifth instalment of the Scary Movie franchise does do that.</Review>
            <Review>A boldly uninspired torrent of halfhearted slapstick, interminable poop jokes, and pointless pop-culture references, a veritable tsunami of idiocy.</Review>

        <StoryLine>A child with magical powers takes on mean-spirited grown ups in this family-friendly fantasy from the Netherlands. Quark (Porgy Franssen) is a wizard who happens upon some unusual eggs while taking a walk through the Witches' Woods. To Quark's surprise, when the egg hatches, what emerges isn't a bird but a little girl; naming her Fuchsia (Rachelle Verdel), Quark raises the child as his own, and he's pleased when she shows an impressive aptitude for magic. Quark arranges for Fuchsia to attend a school for witches run by Miss Minuul (Annet Malherbe), a witch who has long been infatuated with Quark. Fuchsia has a mischievous spirit and her tricks sometimes go wrong, but when she learns that a powerful businessman plans to buy the Witches' Woods and clear out the trees, she teams up with Tommy (Lorenso van Sligtenhorst), a mortal boy who is also the nephew of the conniving tycoon, to foil his scheme. Foeksia de Miniheks (aka Fuchsia, The Mini-Witch) was an official selection at the 2011 London BFI Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>The film relies on terse dialogue and boggy colors to create an atmosphere dense with anxiety -- all well handled by director James March.</Review>
            <Review>A respectable political/psychological suspenser, but not a wildly entertaining or enjoyable one.</Review>
            <Review>A tautly minimalist, occasionally generic study of betrayal and family ties.</Review>
            <Review>[Riseborough's] work is indrawn and riveting. It's hard to read the look in her eye, but we never stop trying.</Review>
            <Review>This British thriller by James Marsh is a little too neatly scripted and tightly edited for my taste, but there are galvanizing performances from Andrea Riseborough... and Clive Owen.</Review>
            <Review>These are characters for whom true belief in a cause has probably become impossible; they know how much that costs. Marsh does a compelling job of illustrating that for the rest of us.</Review>
            <Review>Plays slyly with noir; adroitly twists and turns away from easy expectations in its final minutes. This thriller's got one sharp, savage ending. Marsh takes a black-eyed stare out from the gravestone-gray, waning days of the Troubles.</Review>
            <Review>A grim but measured and intelligent art-house slow-burner.</Review>
            <Review>The acting in this film is very good. The plot is lean and powerful. It is pretty depressing, but it seems true enough in its depiction of this troubled period of history.</Review>
            <Review>By the end, the film shows not only the power of this influence but also its terrible price in an often merciless conflict.</Review>
            <Review>Despite solid performances, a slow first half takes away from this otherwise effective drama about an IRA sympathizer whose life becomes more complicated after she's coerced into spying for MI-5.</Review>
            <Review>It's absorbing, intelligent and sad.</Review>

            <Review>It's not worthless, but it's not good. As a genre film, it's too ambitious; as an art film, it's too obvious.</Review>
            <Review>The pretentious, preposterous, dueling-dialect flameout called "Killing Season" has to stand as one of the biggest missed opportunities in iconic matchups.</Review>
            <Review>If you've always wanted to see Robert De Niro forced to thread a steel rod through an open wound and then strung upside down by John Travolta, this is the movie for you.</Review>
            <Review>Tables keep turning, traps keep springing and the actors keep acting, acting, acting.</Review>
            <Review>The sight of Robert De Niro and John Travolta sharing the screen for the first time reps the one and only selling point of Killing Season.</Review>
            <Review>It wants to be a war-is-Hell 'coming home' story, but it ends up playing like a cheap action flick starring two men who are obviously too old to be running through the woods beating the living crap out of each other.</Review>
            <Review>Comes full up with heavy-handed signifiers, from Ben's choice of reading (Hemingway...) to a hammered motif of lapsed Christianity (the climax takes place in a rotting church) that underlines the theme of living with the sins of the past. [Blu-ray]</Review>
            <Review>... establishes some mild tension but never generates any sort of meaningful insight into post-war trauma.</Review>
            <Review>Playing out like a brutally graphic Tom and Jerry skit at times, Killing Season lacks the atmospheric tension necessary to keep us consistently engaged.</Review>
            <Review>Derivative and bizarrely graphic, Killing Season is nothing more than another forgettable entry in two ongoing filmographies that desperately need more inspired professional choices.</Review>
            <Review>Killing Season is competently put together, yet the woefully hollow dialogue and the predictable plot developments make for a pretty bland flick.</Review>

        <Duration>101</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Writer/director Shola Lynch follows up her 2004 documentary Chisholm '72: Unbought and Unbossed with this film centered on the struggle of educator and activist Angela Davis, an outspoken UCLA professor whose affiliation with the Communist Party and the Black Panthers landed her on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list while challenging our perceptions of political freedom in America. From her early years as a student in the U.S. and abroad to her highly publicized arrest and trial following the brazen hostage-taking and murder of Marin County judge Harold Haley in California, Lynch's film leaves no stone unturned as it explores every remarkable detail of Davis' life, and allows her to tell her own stories through a series of intimate interviews. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>Fugitive, radical, communist and philosopher Angela Davis was the lefty hipster's pin-up girl and the right-winger's Afro-ed nightmare, and her authority and charisma are on full display in Free Angela &amp; All Political Prisoners.</Review>
            <Review>"Free Angela and All Political Prisoners" may seem to take place in a distant past, but it resonates with improbable timeliness.</Review>
            <Review>A snappily edited, archivally wallpapered recollection of fearless behavior in the face of an antsy establishment. But it's equally significant as a pointed act of retelling.</Review>
            <Review>Without straining for big-picture significance, it provides a composed look into the revolutionary spirit.</Review>
            <Review>People who weren't around during the '60s-'70s cusp can hardly appreciate just how weird that time was. "Free Angela" brings that weirdness back.</Review>
            <Review>In spite of its attention-grabbing opening and provocative title, Free Angela And All Political Prisoners is less a work of agitprop than straightforward history, intriguing but never unsettling.</Review>
            <Review>Fascinating eye-opener that not only brings history alive, but reverberates into today's controversies over guns, government surveillance, racial profiling, and media frenzy.</Review>
            <Review>An all too sobering reminder of how, in the purported land of the free, any voices deemed radical and hence dangerous can lead the powers that be to find any remote angle to silence them by whatever force and means they deem necessary.</Review>
            <Review>History and media.</Review>
            <Review>It foists its own retelling of Angela Davis's story over any contemplation of her politics, effectively neutering their power as it could apply to today in the hands of a proper film essayist.</Review>
            <Review>Confidently constructed, and aided by an assured focus, this is a solid tribute a woman who was one of many vital pieces of the civil rights movement, and an insightful study of a time when the American identity was being drastically reshaped.</Review>
            <Review>After watching 'Free Angela and All Political Prisoners,' audiences will walk away rejuvenated, thankful and, surprisingly, even more proud to be an American.</Review>

            <Review>The producer's hand is heavy in No Place on Earth, but it ultimately can't sink the inspiring tale of endurance.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is engaging but appallingly superficial when it considers the larger history of the Holocaust.</Review>
            <Review>Janet Tobias has expertly crafted this tale of Jewish families in the western Ukraine fighting for their lives by ferreting underground and living for nearly a year and a half in dark, damp caves in the countryside.</Review>
            <Review>This is the remarkable story of a few of Holocaust survivors who lived over 500 days in caves, coming out into the light only when the German army had been driven from the Ukraine.</Review>

            <Review>A virtual remake of The Evil Dead, but it does showcase some pretty impressive gore.</Review>
            <Review>May get slack for being a completely shameless take on Sam Raimi's horror classic, but I admired it for taking the premise and injecting its own flavor.</Review>
            <Review>Yep, 'wither' must be Swedish for 'the evil dead', as this Nordic nasty slavishly drums out every beat of Sam Raimi's 1981 classic, positioning itself as unofficial 'premake' to Fede Alvarez's authorised reimagining Evil Dead (2013).</Review>

        <StoryLine>Not all of us those amongst us who crave blood are Vampires and not all Vampires crave blood. For those of you expecting anything remotely resembling Twilight, Nosferatu, or Bela Lugosi, VAMPIRE may not be your cup of red elixir...Simply put, VAMPIRE gives new meaning to the word, vampire. Simon seems like a fairly normal, average young man who's devoted to his teaching job and ailing mother. Underneath the surface, however, things are not what they seem. Simon hunts through online chat rooms and message boards, searching for the perfect girl: beautiful, shy, and suicidal. Simon has a particular condition: he is compelled to drink blood.(c) Eleven Arts</StoryLine>

Tom's adviser in matters of the heart is young Harry, abandoned by the rich owners of the house to run wild in the gardens.

        <Duration>120</Duration>
        <StoryLine>POST TENEBRAS LUX ("light after darkness"), ostensibly the story of an upscale, urban family whose move to the Mexican countryside results in domestic crises and class friction, is a stunningly photographed, impressionistic psychological portrait of a family and their place within the sublime, unforgiving natural world. Reygadas conjures a host of unforgettable, ominous images: a haunting sequence at dusk as Reygadas's real-life daughter wanders a muddy field and farm animals loudly circle and thunder and lightning threaten; a glowing-red demon gliding through the rooms of a home; a husband and wife visiting a swingers' bathhouse with rooms named after famous philosophers. By turns entrancing and mystifying, POST TENEBRAS LUX palpably explores the primal conflicts of the human condition. (c) Strand</StoryLine>

            <Review>Reygadas' jagged, broken-logic drama lurches from fantasy to earthbound complications, though it is often hard to tell one from the other.</Review>
            <Review>The result calls for a viewing as different as looking at a Vermeer against Rothko or de Kooning or multiple other modern painters.</Review>
            <Review>Along with Bela Tarr and Terrence Malick, Carlos Reygadas is one of today's few genuinely religious filmmakers.</Review>
            <Review>Moviegoers beholden to clean narrative may feel they need their own explanatory GPS and audio guide. But the richer reward lies in allowing oneself to be led by this gifted director's instinct for lyrical, sensory exploration.</Review>
            <Review>This one delivers a grand pictorialism and piercing existential moments that float atop the maundering narrative like noodles in soup.</Review>
            <Review>It's as if Reygadas started with a sprawling cache of visual ideas and then tried to find some way to organize them all. The effect can be frustrating at times, but also surprising and beguiling.</Review>
            <Review>As irritating as this film is, I am grateful for it. Reygadas is an artist, and an uncompromising one at that.</Review>
            <Review>An unusually bold and bizarre drama that offers a different way of looking at film.</Review>
            <Review>It's a picture one could walk away from for a period of time and the movie wouldn't notice.</Review>
            <Review>A completely essential piece of film art.</Review>
            <Review>Post Tenebras Lux is a film rich with sheer material presence, making good on Reygadas's apparent intention to make the viewer truly feel the audible and the visible, but his pictorial gimmickry can only do so much aesthetic heavy-lifting.</Review>
            <Review>Even with its head games and confusions, "Post Tenebras Lux" is an imposing spiritual work,</Review>

            <Review>You don't really care who done it, you just want it to be over with.</Review>
            <Review>Neither suspenseful nor even comprehensible, John Swetnam's dashed-off script (carelessly directed by Olatunde Osunsanmi) throws up plenty of red herrings - and a stupendously idiotic ending - but not a single character worth caring about.</Review>
            <Review>[Evidence] tries to camouflage a standard serial-killer story with digital flimflam and intellectual pretensions.</Review>
            <Review>The always beguiling Radha Mitchell can't save this stunted procedural-horror combo.</Review>
            <Review>There are interesting ideas here, sadly let down by a weak central plot and formulaic realisation.</Review>
            <Review>may lose [the] viewer before the surprises late in the film</Review>
            <Review>Evidence is actually three slightly incongruous film ideas in one almost effective package.</Review>
            <Review>Familiar, predictable, unoriginal... but not entirely unwatchable.</Review>
            <Review>The story's strained, reaching plot goes so far off the CommonSense-o-Meter that there's more than enough "evidence" to convict this movie of impersonating a good mystery.</Review>
            <Review>Again, that the film actually makes time to set up a purpose for the found footage is marvelous. The rest of Evidence doesn't share the same inspiration.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>91</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Dan Sallitt's remarkable, boldly conceived fourth feature is a vivid character study of Jackie, a charismatic, fiercely intelligent, soulful young woman struggling to navigate the choppy waters of adolescence, and nurturing an intense emotional attachment to her older brother that crosses over unmistakably into incestuousness. A critic and blogger as well as a filmmaker, Sallitt has established a unique and confident voice, both in his writing and in his long-gestating but always impressive feature films (all of which will be screening at Anthology on this calendar). A great admirer of (and profoundly astute commentator on) the work of such masters of behavioral cinema as Eric Rohmer, Maurice Pialat, and Mikio Naruse, Sallitt is perhaps contemporary American cinema's foremost keeper of their flame, and THE UNSPEAKABLE ACT a deeply moving example of his craft.

            <Review>It feels selectively edited toward a predetermined point of view.</Review>
            <Review>[Plods] from one performance to the next with unnecessary asides for veteran Journey members to talk about their own lives (trivia of interest to megafans and no one else).</Review>
            <Review>As infectious as Pineda's enthusiasm is, "Don't Stop Believin' " too often relies on his inherent appeal as a film subject, rarely probing more deeply than the narrative he and his bandmates provide.</Review>
            <Review>Ms. Diaz settles for a flabby, repetitive showcase for the songs and an attaboy for their newest singer.</Review>
            <Review>Pineda's ebullience is infectious, and "Don't Stop Believin': Everyman's Journey" is a pleasant story of dreams coming true.</Review>
            <Review>Diaz insists on selling Pineda's promo-friendly myth at the expense of the richer, more complicated story of a dreamer who learns to become the durable professional his bandmates expect.</Review>
            <Review>A glorified home movie, complete with self-congratulary smugness from the band's original members.</Review>
            <Review>Pineda's humility is a rare rockumentary commodity, but the film around him is riven with underarticulated tensions: any suspicion that the management might have employed third-world labour to enable the show to go on is simply shrugged off.</Review>
            <Review>Rather than a faux psychological analysis, the film offers instead a general commentary on how class, race, and nationality-as well as gender, even more generally-shape Arnel's experience.</Review>
            <Review>By the time the band arrives in Manila for Pineda's emotional homecoming, every note feels as if it's been earned.</Review>
            <Review>Once this new Journey has become a success, "Don't Stop Believin'" doesn't have a whole lot more to say on the subject.</Review>
            <Review>All mic-ed up, but also all mixed up, this indulgently apportioned doc is a glad-handing fan project all the way.</Review>

        </Directors>
        <Reviews>
            <Review>It's clear that Garrone is lamenting the death of culture. But the movie is more compassionate than screed-y. It's a portrait of the preoccupation with fame in an age in which in fame is cheap.</Review>
            <Review>The satire here is finespun, and the film's conclusions ambiguous.</Review>
            <Review>A dark allegorical comedy about the nature of fame, about obsession, about madness - and the point where they converge: on Big Brother, a TV show watched by millions.</Review>
            <Review>For all its ups and downs and occasional detours into boorishness, it's an original that will surprise if not necessarily delight fans of Garrone's very different crime drama, "Gomorrah."</Review>
            <Review>Matteo Garrone follows his crime epic Gomorrah with a comedy about reality TV, and though it hardly rivals the earlier movie in its social complexity, it still offers the spectacle of a vibrant and vividly realized Neapolitan neighborhood.</Review>
            <Review>As cautionary tales go, this one's ripely knowing, and it speaks in a lot more languages than Italian.</Review>
            <Review>It's all very well done, with evocative character actors like those used by Fellini, and settings reminiscent of Vittorio De Sica's 1960s comedies.</Review>
            <Review>In this echo chamber of fame-for-fame's-sake, real life imitates reel life. There's a lurid, Felliniesque sheen to Garrone's floating camerawork; this is reality tweaked, dialed up to 10.1. And there's a cheeky, sideways satire of Roman Catholicism.</Review>
            <Review>Reality is a little too thin to be truly satisfying. However, Garrone's elegant visual palette and Arena's remarkable central performance shift a potentially trite message into a gloriously warm and novel experience.</Review>
            <Review>The story is too slight.</Review>
            <Review>This movie shows a bit of the human costs of reality TV, but not the full extent of it.</Review>
            <Review>Those who found Gomorrah embarrassingly overrated can relax. Despite a first half that's basically a spin-off of the 2008 movie that brought Matteo Garrone international acclaim, Reality turns out to be its veritable refutation.</Review>

            <Review>In critical ways, the movie is a mess. The basketball scenes are so sloppy and haphazard that the would-be slapstick registers as confusion. But away from the court, the actors bring their caricatures to folksy comic life.</Review>
            <Review>A Lifetime movie, minus the commercials, but with every predictable twist and turn and treacly message intact. She shoots. It bores.</Review>
            <Review>Lifetime movies have their pleasures, and so does this film.</Review>
            <Review>[A] strained and soapy empowerment comedy ...</Review>
            <Review>Even though it earns an R rating for profanity and some risque material, it's too meek and mild-mannered to qualify as brave, or even slyly subversive.</Review>
            <Review>This comedy deserves credit for taking a decided viewpoint - and delivering a heartfelt if occasionally misguided message.</Review>
            <Review>unlikely to put Susan Seidelman back in the front ranks of Hollywood, even though it is an enjoyable, albeit highly derivative, comedy that dares to put "women of a certain age" front and center.</Review>
            <Review>It's heart is in the right place, but -- with poor writing, lame humor and dreadful on-court sequences -- that's one of the only things right about it.</Review>
            <Review>By and large this is a film meant to do exactly what the film's charity event does: to provide light entertainment while raising money for a good cause.</Review>
            <Review>Abundant good intentions help to soften the predictably mild impact of this broad female-empowerment comedy.</Review>
            <Review>A sparkling, heartfelt albeit slightly uneven dramedy refreshingly grounded in realism.</Review>
            <Review>Funny, sometimes funky feminist fable by ur-feminist director Susan Seidelman is easy to like, if hard to believe.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 1979</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>90</Duration>
        <StoryLine>In The Odd Angry Shot director Tom Jeffrey provides a cathartic Australian answer to Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter. Australia's participation in the Vietnam War was as much of an alienating and soul-searching experience for Australians as for Americans, and Jeffrey's frank portrayal of a group of Australian volunteers casts the war in a different light from the perspective of a Cimino or Oliver Stone. The story concerns a corp of Australian elite soldiers -- the Special Air Service troops (the equivalent of the United States' Special Forces group) -- and the elite group's more pragmatic and hopeful attitudes -- whiling away the time in mindless diversions and cracking jokes. Then one of their own is killed and their feelings about the war suddenly change. ~ Paul Brenner, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <Duration>100</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Hubert Minel, a brash 17 year old, dislikes his mother intensely. He gauges her with contempt, only seeing her out-of-date sweater, her kitschy d�cor and the vile bread crumbs that lodge in the corners of her noisy mouth. Below the surface of these irritating traits, lie the ingrained mechanisms that his mother has always cultivated so dearly - manipulation and guilt. Hubert, confused and torn by a love-hate relationship that obsesses him more and more each day, wanders in and out of an adolescence that is both marginal an typical, combining artistic discovery, openness to friendship, ostracism, and sex. All the while, he is consumed by his all encompassing contempt for this woman he somehow once loved. -- (C) Regent</StoryLine>

            <Review>As a director, Mr. Dolan has a freewheeling style, and he's self-dramatizing enough to want to call attention to it without being too much of a visual show-off.</Review>
            <Review>This just might be as close as we'll ever get to seeing "Catcher in the Rye" on the screen. Truly hilarious.</Review>
            <Review>There's much to praise, especially the oh-so-real dialogue, but true psychological penetration is lacking and Dolan's hunger to prove his talent results in a superfluity of styles.</Review>
            <Review>Uneven but funny and audacious adolescent comedy from a talented beginner.</Review>
            <Review>A coming-of-age tale as ferociously raw as its teller -- the very young Xavier Dolan.</Review>
            <Review>What makes it extraordinary is its depth of feeling, which Dolan's age makes all the more impressive: he was just 19 when he made this.</Review>
            <Review>As an actor, Dolan's an accomplished comedian, one with a tragic core. And as a screenwriter and director, he's even better.</Review>
            <Review>Dolan's vision, however distracted, remains strong ( ... ) As a writer, director, producer, and actor, he throws himself into the film's disjointed spaces, highlighting the ways in which multiple and contradictory states can be inhabited simultaneously</Review>
            <Review>Wonderful performances, poignant story, light tone and nifty visuals add up to a smart art-house package. Should hold appeal well beyond the gay crowd.</Review>
            <Review>For Dorval's acting alone, the film is a must-see. Add to that Dolan's own petulant performance, knowing eye for character detail, offbeat camera set-ups and assured direction, and the movie becomes a blissful character study. It's fabulous.</Review>
            <Review>The film is annoyingly atelene.</Review>
            <Review>(Xavier) Dolan's perceptive portrait isn't particularly nuanced but it does have the slap of honesty...</Review>

            <Review>This is the most depressing movie ever made about radicalism.</Review>

            <Review>Redford the director keeps things moving smoothly, avoiding too many lengthy monologues while still getting the point across ...</Review>
            <Review>A drama that's more than a look at what happened to a generation of socially aware hippies whose new drug of choice is likely Lipitor.</Review>
            <Review>Redford is an adequate director, and he keeps things moving at a moderate pace, passing up exits to more spectacular vistas or hotter issues.</Review>

            <Review>Far and away the most impressive thing about it is that Redford's ability to convince his famous friends to appear in small roles.</Review>
            <Review>The Company You Keep is an effective, slow-burning mystery, boasting one of the most impressive casts of the last few years.</Review>
            <Review>Redford proves that he's still capable of making the sort of provocative political thrillers that would make a younger generation envious.</Review>

            <Review>Sensitive and almost unwatchably perceptive about dysfunctional families -- and it's acted with knife-sharp precision.</Review>
            <Review>The film is touching, filled with taste and care, but not enough to avoid being coy and sentimental.</Review>
            <Review>On the surface, this indie does sound like standard-issue material, but its dynamics are far more complex than its simple exterior.</Review>
            <Review>What Maisie Knew gives the audience a ground-eye view of its mesmerizing title character, a plucky, charismatic New Yorker who navigates downtown bars and building lobbies with the street savvy of a pro.</Review>
            <Review>The result is a film that deeply engages us on multiple levels. Not only do we wonder what Maisie knows and how she knows it, we want to get this seedling to a place where she won't have to be transplanted every day.</Review>
            <Review>It's a study of human nature, not at its worst, but at its most typically pathetic, and it goes to show that the more things don't change, the more they stay lousy.</Review>
            <Review>Esta é a grande tragédia dos maus pais: o fato de não merecerem o amor incondicional que recebem dos pequenos seres que destroem com tanta facilidade.</Review>
            <Review>It's often-heartbreaking stuff, but never feels manipulative, mostly because the movie puts itself in Maisie's shoes. Strongly recommended</Review>
            <Review>Scott McGehee and David Siegel's adaptation commendably preserves the book's child perspective even if it doesn't quite match the characteristically dark shades of the author's moral fare.</Review>
            <Review>A superb, moving film, it's a tribute to author Henry James that his 1897 story could prove so illuminating when adapted for the 21st century. Performances throughout are terrific, seeped as they are in guilt, resentment and confusion.</Review>
            <Review>The filmmakers, Scott McGehee and David Siegel, seem not at all intimidated by Henry James's formidable prose.</Review>
            <Review>Some scenes are tinged with dark comedy; some are heartrending; and some fuse the two, as when Maisie comforts a tearful friend during a sleepover in Susanna's huge Manhattan townhouse, while the delinquent grown-ups indulge themselves downstairs.</Review>

            <Review>It's all done with care and authentic Japanese locations ... But there's scant drama.</Review>
            <Review>A stodgy movie that mixes dubious history with a clichéd, Madame Butterfly romance story, set in the period immediately following Japan's surrender in 1945.</Review>
            <Review>Emperor falls prey to the temptations endemic to historical docudrama: the desire to pack a miniseries' worth of events into one feature-length film, with romance tossed in for added appeal.</Review>
            <Review>Half crinoline romance, half crusty military-history lesson.</Review>
            <Review>Offers a labored treatise on the Japanese national character, with endless speeches about honor, devotion, loyalty, and the people's reverence for their emperor as a human deity.</Review>
            <Review>Just a dull procedural, with the bland Matthew Fox driving around in a jeep and asking questions and not having them answered.</Review>
            <Review>Imagine if POTUS was considered by U.S. citizenry to be a living god. Japanese emperors were. Does one then hang a living god as a war criminal? A riveting period portrayal.</Review>
            <Review>The little-known historical events provide a pointed exploration of a momentous collision of two cultures.</Review>
            <Review>Emperor will do well enough. But if you want a more nuanced take on the same events, check out Alexander Sokurov's extraordinary The Sun</Review>
            <Review>Fun when Jones is around, dull when he's not, it's all just a little bit of history repeating.</Review>
            <Review>Hokey monologues about the finger of historical blame are interspersed with perfume-ad flashbacks to idyllic days of love; you half expect Andrew Lloyd Webber to descend from on high to provide a few touching show tunes.</Review>
            <Review>The climax, when MacArthur finally meets Hirohito, is fascinating - and validated by the end-credit, picture-led round-up of what happened to the leading characters.</Review>

            <Review>It's not the sheer predictability of the ensuing frolics that's hardest to take, or even the dismal attempts at humour ... but the sheer misery of watching actors you once respected demean themselves in such utterly worthless fodder.</Review>
            <Review>Barring a few off-color jokes, though, the movie feels like a Carol Burnett sketch dragged out to feature length.</Review>
            <Review>It's tired and dated with too few laughs to justify the stultifying attempts at drama and the impossible-to-swallow plot contortions.</Review>
            <Review>Looks great, some terrific ingredients, but when you slice it up, what a disappointment.</Review>
            <Review>Sarandon, Keaton and De Niro mesh beautifully, fully convincing as a trio of old friends and carting in lots of characterization that would be otherwise lacking in Zackham's rote screenplay.</Review>
            <Review>For all its surface amiability, The Big Wedding might be one of the more frustrating films of the year.</Review>
            <Review>Some scripts can be saved by a good cast that delivers the material with as much chutzpah as possible. And then there are some that are simply unsalvageably dreadful.</Review>
            <Review>Não é apenas uma má comédia; é mau Cinema.</Review>
            <Review>The goofy characters waltz through plenty of offbeat situations, but that's not enough because quirky and funny are not synonymous.</Review>
            <Review>What it desperately needed was more originality. I suppose Zackham thought that if he just got a great cast and sprinkled enough humor into it, then those would be enough to cover up all the flaws in the script. Unfortunately, he was very much mistaken.</Review>
            <Review>Behold the unholy matrimony of hack-job romance and whack-job comedy. Witness the blindingly bleached marriage of house-porn and cocky Caucasian privilege. Suffer the union of former A-list stars and express-cashed paycheques.</Review>
            <Review>Built on chaotically disparate tones and extremely broad jokes that never hit their mark, The Big Wedding is completely devoid of laughs.</Review>

            <Review>This horror sequel delivers the explicitly bloody mayhem genre fans crave.</Review>
            <Review>There's something curiously underwhelming about the blood-soaked mayhem on display in Hatchet III.</Review>
            <Review>Will there be a "Hatchet IV''? I shudder to think about it.</Review>
            <Review>When the title of a movie consists of a number and the name of a tool, expectations are likely to be pretty low. So it feels somewhat incongruous to call "Hatchet III" a disappointment.</Review>
            <Review>The crowd that likes these things will certainly be psyched. Everyone else, not so much.</Review>
            <Review>As in the earlier installments, the climax comes across as merely one last cliché designed to please gore aficionados who've been schooled on past, superior horror efforts.</Review>
            <Review>It may not be perfect, but Hatchet III is still a ton of fun and McDonnell does a great job at delivering a sequel that feels much bigger and bolder than anything we've seen so far in the Hatchet series.</Review>
            <Review>The trilogy ends with a bang. And blood. A bit clumsy in the plot department but still pretty good fun.</Review>
            <Review>Hatchet III more specifically recalls the output from indie outfits like Troma. Which, given the energy and thrills provided by McDonnell's bare-bones bloodbath, is perhaps exactly as it should be...</Review>
            <Review>It is time that Victor buries the hatchet once and for all, and gets out while he is ahead - or at least not totally behind.</Review>
            <Review>It's great to see Zach Galligan on the big screen again, but Hatchet III serves up a host of unimaginative kills stymied by terrible gore effects. Strictly for fans of the series.</Review>
            <Review>HATCHET III is almost as much gleefully gory fun as the original - a comedy-horror hybrid that elicits screams of laughter and disgust in equal measure...</Review>

        <StoryLine>It is the deadliest weapon made by man. The mere mention of its name fills hearts with terror. Long shrouded in mystery, it launches from a distance and locks onto the target's head, the internal blades decapitating the victim with the yank of a chain. A weapon of choice for elite fighters, the flying guillotine leaves victims begging for mercy. A secret brotherhood of assassins - known only as The Guillotines - were once favored by the Emperor, but are now a force of terror and oppression under a new regime. Exiled to a remote village and hunted by a squad of fighters with firearms that challenge their cold steel, The Guillotines must now outwit and outfight enemies from both sides. From the director of the smash hit INFERNAL AFFAIRS and LEGEND OF THE FIST: THE RETURN OF CHEN ZHEN comes a brutal tale of honor, revenge, and the ultimate weapon. (c) WellGoUSA</StoryLine>

            <Review>The lack of rip-roaring martial arts or even a half-decent storyline will leave genre aficionados feeling short-changed.</Review>
            <Review>The plot is of little importance - the spectacular action and gorgeous landscapes and costumes are what matter.</Review>
            <Review>The blades fly as do the heads, but the movie remains disappointingly aground.</Review>
            <Review>The Guillotines expends most of its energy in its first 30 minutes, leaving the audience with roughly 90 minutes of soapy Qing Dynasty fan fiction.</Review>
            <Review>A historical action epic set during the Qing dynasty that amounts to a bait-and-switch for wuxia fans stoked for steel-meets-flesh mayhem.</Review>
            <Review>A corny saga of social and generational conflict, it's ultimately yet another Chinese period epic that functions as a thinly veiled treatise on the nobility of socialist equality.</Review>
            <Review>The Guillotines is an overdramatic and fluffy piece of cinema that has a few decent moments, but is otherwise forgettable.</Review>
            <Review>Any topical relevance for the material is compromised by a script that is woefully clumsy and melodramatic.</Review>
            <Review>Although a bit too gory for me and difficult to follow at times, the film also boasts some gorgeous visuals as well as intriguing characters played by Ethan Juan and Xiaoming Huang.</Review>
            <Review>Despite the multitude of cinematic tricks the prolific Andrew Lau has up his sleeve, the film is a disappointingly rote entry in the wuxia pantheon.</Review>
            <Review>Clearly a commentary on the shifting status of rule in modern day China, the prolific Lau's latest is nevertheless an obtuse work that buries much of its subtext and historical relevance beneath overstated dramatics and cacophonous staging.</Review>
            <Review>All the solemnity is deadly: Not one of these superhuman gang members registers in memory, and you feel stiffed on gory giggles. Talk about having your chain yanked.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Angel, 15 years old (recidivist): assault and auto theft. Davis, 16 years old: possession of narcotics with intent to resell. Butch, 17 years old: assault on a correctional officer. The three are taken to Enola Vale Youth Correctional Center in Montana and placed under the authority and watch of Officer Goodyear, a strict but caring guard. Butch faces the prospect of adult prison and tries to keep a low profile... until he and Davis become the subject of ruthless assaults by another inmate, Banks. Returning from solitary after they refused to rat Banks out, Butch challenges his attacker as the top dog. Like a bunch of strays locked up in the pound, the young men struggle to keep their bodies and spirits intact, but each act of violence swells ever more forcefully. (c) Tribeca Film</StoryLine>

            <Review>Overheated melodrama of inmates at a juvenile detention facility hits all the prison-movie clichés.</Review>
            <Review>The plot willfully denies our satisfaction, often at the risk of compromising its own structural integrity.</Review>
            <Review>Intense scenes of violence build to a conclusion that will leave you shaken.</Review>
            <Review>The film is graced by excellent acting and based on extensive research.</Review>
            <Review>With largely improvised dialogue and a cast including genuine ex-offenders, Chapiron captures a powerful stench of authenticity.</Review>
            <Review>Covers predictable ground with admirable sincerity and is notable for some eye-catching performances, not least that of Adam Butcher as an angry young man.</Review>

        <StoryLine>A Norwegian fisherman survives a shipwreck at sea, and wrestles with the guilt of being the sole survivor while being celebrated as a national hero in this affecting drama based on actual events. Iceland, Westman Islands: 1984. Gulli (�lafur Darri �lafsson) and his crew of seasoned seamen welcome a new cook into the fold before sailing out to sea on what appears to be a typical fishing excursion. With a chill in the air, the crew casts their nets into the frigid waters in hopes of netting a big catch. But when the net gets snagged, the boat capsizes, plunging the terrified crew into the icy, churning depths. Incredibly, as the rest of the crew parishes, Gulli somehow summons the strength to keep swimming until he reaches the shore. Later, as Gulli recovers, scientists speculate that no mortal man should have been able to survive such harsh conditions, and take him to a London research center for a battery of physical tests. Meanwhile, on the outside, the stout sailor becomes a symbol of national pride for a country that had endured great hardships over the past century. Haunted by the events of that fateful night, Gulli later returns home to comfort the children of his best friend and fellow sailor, and remember how it feels to lead a normal life.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Even knowing the outcome ... doesn't diminish the intensity and awe of watching it recreated in this deftly framed docudrama by prodigious Icelandic auteur Kormakur.</Review>
            <Review>Baltasar Kormakur's latest is a touching, low-key depiction of an incident in which a fishing boat sinks a few miles from shore.</Review>
            <Review>Director Baltasar Kormákur filmed on an actual trawler, which he sank, and its authentic-looking scenes will leave you shivering and reaching for a cardy.</Review>

            <Review>...the film is rarely, if ever, as captivating as one might've expected and/or hoped.</Review>
            <Review>Dedicated as it is to 'Icelandic fishermen', you'll never look at a fillet of prime cod in the same light again.</Review>
            <Review>It's an unexpected but provocative direction by Kormákur, who's placed himself in exactly the right elements to make this masterful film.</Review>
            <Review>[Gulli's] story's pretty remarkable. But this film achieves a real kind of lonely magic when he's bobbing on the waves under the night sky, talking to a gull.</Review>
            <Review>A beautiful-looking tale of survival, which is both harrowing and uplifting in equal measure.</Review>
            <Review>Kormákur achieves breathtaking realism and poetry in the will to live.</Review>

            <Review>Walter Salles's warm but strangely staid adaptation of a piece of literature that was never meant to be tamed as cinema.</Review>
            <Review>"On the Road" is something of a sprawling mess, but then so is the novel.</Review>
            <Review>It took more than half a century, but Jack Kerouac's autobiographical cult novel of bohemian youth in postwar America has reached the screen in wonderful form.</Review>
            <Review>Against all odds, a surprisingly effective movie.</Review>
            <Review>In Salles, screenwriter Jose Rivera and company's effort to get the details right, they only get so far. And it's not quite far enough.</Review>
            <Review>Although the film is sensationally photographed and artfully directed and scored, it's ultimately strictly dullsville, man.</Review>
            <Review>Despite the obvious enthusiasm of the screenwriter, the director, and the actors for Kerouac's novel, they get it wrong. Probably nobody can get it right, since the power is in the words, not the story.</Review>
            <Review>Salles can't recreate the feeling of finding oneself in Kerouac's prose</Review>
            <Review>It's hard to imagine how such an exciting book became such a boring movie.</Review>
            <Review>A booze-soaked, drug-riddled, sex-filled escapade with no real point about young people casting off whatever yokes chain them and seeing what's out there. It captures the pure exhilaration of freedom for its own sake.</Review>
            <Review>If our On the Road is a barely coherent tightrope act - a fizzy word drunk stand-up speed-rapped by an aspiring poet posing as a dumb saint prole - then it's tough to take this pretty version, populated by Gap models in retro Americana fashions.</Review>

            <Review>The striking compositions mingle childlike curiosity with adult decadence -- and natural beauty with garish consumer culture -- to provocative, even profound effect.</Review>
            <Review>That churning in your stomach may be unpleasant, but it's necessary for the film to deliver its knockout punch.</Review>
            <Review>The whole affair curdles into a feeling of unearned, defensive superiority.</Review>
            <Review>Ulrich Seidl: sadomasochistic provocateur or compassionate observer of the human condition?</Review>
            <Review>One of the most disturbing films I've seen in a very long time.</Review>
            <Review>Seidl sternly rejects nuance. All the women are crude and insensitive, all the men are desperate and exploited.</Review>
            <Review>Even as he critiques the social dynamic, Seidl is never less than humane, spending serious time loitering with marginalized characters no other filmmaker deems worthy of time.</Review>
            <Review>A film that, once watched, is not readily un-watched, in both good and dismaying ways alike.</Review>
            <Review>Watching Paradise: Love is a visceral, Schadenfreude-tinged experience that produces belly laughs and queasiness alike-sometimes in tandem.</Review>
            <Review>A poignant film about the desperation of tubby, middle-aged Austrian women who take a sex tour to Kenya.</Review>
            <Review>This cleverly made film is often painful to watch since we understand from the start where it's heading, so we watch helplessly as the lead character is warped by her yearning for love.</Review>
            <Review>The problem is not with the hopelessness of Seidl's vision, it is with the predictability of the tonal arc.</Review>

            <Review>How sick can fans of a celebrity get? Very, answers "Antiviral." Imagine fan fetish culture metastasizing. A pox on consumers and capitalists alike, Brandon Cronenberg sneers.</Review>
            <Review>If Cronenberg's not yet a dead ringer for his iconic dad, he's taken an intriguing first step.</Review>
            <Review>The pace is uneven, the energy sluggish (even the arrival of Malcolm McDowell in the third act doesn't pep things up) and the film feels overlong.</Review>
            <Review>What Jones hasn't been given is a character to play. Syd is a cipher, neither sympathetic nor hateful, nor even interestingly human.</Review>
            <Review>Eventually the clammy spell of this handsomely designed but solemnly paced movie begins to wear off, and you long for a little action or at least some fresh air.</Review>
            <Review>Before long, the aggressive sleekness of Antiviral becomes its own kind of ennui.</Review>
            <Review>A tough, almost willfully difficult movie, but it's fascinating more often than it is dramatically off-putting.</Review>
            <Review>Antiviral is what happens when you make a movie around a fleetingly interesting idea but forget to find a story in it.</Review>
            <Review>...a ridiculous and flat-out dumb premise that's employed to terminally underwhelming effect by Cronenberg...</Review>
            <Review>With an obsession for close-ups of needles piercing skin, Antiviral leaves one with a OCD-style desire to wash ones hands... the overreaching success of the film lies in its believable depiction of a culture slowly rotting at the core.</Review>
            <Review>The script is thin but effectively creepy as it examines contemporary pop culture obsessions while maximizing the queasy close-ups of needles, blood and medical procedures.</Review>
            <Review>Brandon Cronenberg's movie works equally as a social satire and a supremely twisted horror tale that would make his Pop proud.</Review>

            <Review>This charming Australian import has a groove much like other low-key, let's-put-on-a-show indies such as Hear My Song and The Commitments, and never uses its social conscience as simply backbeat.</Review>
            <Review>The harmonies they strike in this reality-inspired charmer are sweetly sublime.</Review>
            <Review>You could drive an Abrams tank through the film's plot holes, but you'll likely be too busy enjoying yourself to bother.</Review>
            <Review>"The Sapphires" feels like a movie you've already seen, but it's nonetheless thoroughly enjoyable, like a pop song that's no less infectious when you know every word.</Review>
            <Review>"The Sapphires" sparkles with sass and Motown soul.</Review>
            <Review>Sapphires is hardly a cinematic diamond mine. But this Commitments-style mashup of music and melodrama manages to entertain without demanding too much of its audience.</Review>
            <Review>The clichés are rendered painless by excellent performances from the five principles, with O'Dowd and Mailman particularly standing out.</Review>
            <Review>A heavy-handed anti-racism message isn't easier to take when played to a Motown beat, though the Australian comedy-drama The Sapphires acts otherwise.</Review>
            <Review>The Sapphires has too many facets.</Review>
            <Review>The skill and sly moments of real panache help turn The Sapphires into a shining example of the type of film this country really ought to be making more of.</Review>
            <Review>Tries to dazzle itself but the shine comes off quickly, as this weakly structured story flees at the sight of any lingering dramatic conflict, preferring to turn history into a pleasant song-and-dance routine.</Review>
            <Review>A unique and heartening look at four young women blossoming into mature adults as they enjoy a bout with success in the midst of a hard-fought war.</Review>

            <Review>Glorious vision of youth and truth, love and loss, your name is Mud.</Review>
            <Review>An evocative highlight of the American movie year so far.</Review>
            <Review>Sadly, Nichols, who made the superb Take Shelter, gets mired in mood this time around. But there's still an evocative sense of childhood exploration, and a gritty performance by Matthew McConaughey.</Review>
            <Review>For at least three-quarters of the way, this is a fine film, and one that kids and parents could see together.</Review>
            <Review>There is an enchanted-fairy-tale aspect to Mud, but its bright, calm surface only barely disguises a strong, churning undercurrent.</Review>
            <Review>A modern fairy tale, steeped in the sleepy Mississippi lore of Twain and similar American writers, and with a heart as big as the river is wide.</Review>
            <Review>Mud has a stellar cast. Nichols knows they'll do the heavy lifting for him, and his nuanced direction and thoughtful visuals lets them do exactly that.</Review>
            <Review>A Huckleberry Finn-type tale with edges, Mud is an adolescent adventure that should charm adults.</Review>
            <Review>The type of film that's miraculously heartwarming, while also mournful and filled with sorrow.</Review>
            <Review>McConaughey masterpiece as a a man on the run in Mississippi.</Review>
            <Review>If Mud isn't the best movie of this young year, it's certainly the most instantly satisfying.</Review>
            <Review>Despite an almost sluggish pace, Nichols nevertheless finds the rhythm of Southern rural village life with its wary think-hard-before-you-speak watchfulness.</Review>

            <Review>Despite the old fashioned, mawkish tone, I found the story to have a cumulative effect on me.</Review>
            <Review>I can only glean that Cavalcade's obscurity is owed largely to the fact that it's just not that great a movie.</Review>
            <Review>Critics at the time loved this rather sanctimonious jaunt through history. Seen from the vantage point of post-Second World War egalitarianism, however, it all appears quaint and riddled with accepted class differences.</Review>
            <Review>It's hard not to see Cavalcade today as a corny contraption... [Blu-ray]</Review>
            <Review>As drama it gets a little too soapy and the jumps in time can seem abrupt, but "Cavalcade" really does convey a sense of history and historical periods.</Review>

        <Title>Ishtar</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 1987</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>107</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Ishtar has taken on a life of its own, infamous for the $40-million production cost, with Director Elaine May being compared to Eric Von Stroheim in terms of legendary extravagance resulting in costly overruns. The movie was mercilessly panned and declared one of the biggest box-office disasters of the 1980s, though the feature is not that bad, just not as funny as it could have been. Lyle Rogers (Warren Beatty) and Chuck Clarke (Dustin Hoffman) are two hopelessly inept but forever hopeful New York tunesmiths. With the help of agent Marty Freed (Jack Weston), the two get a gig at the Chez Casablanca in Morocco. After their arrival, the duo is entangled in the political chaos that plagues the region. Lyle and Chuck try to write inspired songs -- that are hilariously bad -- but they never give up the hope of penning a hit. CIA agent Jim Harrison (Charles Grodin) recruits Chuck to work for the agency, while femme fatale Shirra Assel (Isabella Adjani) gets Lyle to help do her bidding. Chuck and Lyle wander aimlessly in the desert on a blind camel as they become the targets of an accelerated manhunt. International spies gather with vultures in hopes of catching the singing saps. There are shades of the Bob Hope and Bing Crosby "Road" films here, but the overall results are uneven. Coupled with the budget problems and the high public interest of a film with both Hoffman and Beatty, the feature was viewed at the time as a disaster -- as well as becoming a box-office flop. Compared to Kevin Costner's costly flop Waterworld, however, this film is much better on all levels.</StoryLine>

            <Review>..an undeniably messy movie that you nonetheless want to treasure just for its oddball existence.</Review>
            <Review>Maybe [it's] actually okay; maybe parts of it [are] even great.</Review>
            <Review>The performances are endearing enough, the pacing is actually quite crisp and there is no shortage of zany silliness in the story. It just never gels.</Review>
            <Review>The 1980s saw the release of so many truly atrocious films (Xanadu, Stroker Ace, Bolero, Shanghai Surprise, etc.) that it's absurd "Ishtar" became shorthand for the worst of the worst and continues to be blasted by folks who haven't even seen it.</Review>
            <Review>Besides droll supporting work from an excellent Charles Grodin, Ishtar also gets a lot of mileage out of its terrible and terribly funny songs.</Review>
            <Review>If Ishtar has a personal stamp, it's not in what it has to say about Reagan-era militarism, but in what it has to say about collaboration, and how well-meaning people can goose each other to greatness-and folly.</Review>
            <Review>Ishtar is a failure on practically every level from its misguided narrative to its lack of humor to the absence of anything remotely entertaining.</Review>
            <Review>A victim of its own hyped publicity and too harsh criticism, Ishtar is not the worst movie ever made or even a bomb, just a dim-witted silly comedy-thriller (with some good jokes) based on the casting against type of Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman.</Review>
            <Review>Quote not available.</Review>
            <Review>The intentionally bad songs and the early scenes in New York City are amusing, but the movie totally falls apart once Beatty and Hoffman arrive in the fictional country of Ishtar.</Review>
            <Review>A failed attempt at doing a modern Bob Hope-Bing Crosby "Road" picture.</Review>

            <Review>It's not a new story, true, but "West of Memphis" makes it both extremely personal and universally painful.</Review>
            <Review>We feel like we're watching an overlong true-crime television episode and not a movie.</Review>
            <Review>A real-life horror story, made no less shocking by the familiarity of its early scenes.</Review>
            <Review>While the "Paradise Lost" films captured events as they unfolded in the heat of battle, "West of Memphis" has the luxury of at least partial closure.</Review>
            <Review>A true-crime story that begins with a notorious murder case and grows into a chilling indictment of the American justice system.</Review>
            <Review>And justice for all? Hardly.</Review>
            <Review>A documentary that distills 19 years of a witch hunt, a grass roots movement, lost leads, confusion, countless appeals, and hope into one remarkable movie that is hellbent on setting the record straight.</Review>
            <Review>It effectively condenses what took the 'Paradise Lost' films nearly eight hours to reveal into a tight, snappy 149 minutes that affords you everything you need to know about the West Memphis Three.</Review>
            <Review>It's another case where, instead of a prosecution having to prove a case, a defendant has to choose the lesser of two evils. "This happens all the time," defendant Damien Echols says of the whole process, and he's right.</Review>
            <Review>A sobering look at how the wheels of justice can be -- and are -- manipulated by political expediency and a small town's tendrils of the old boy network</Review>
            <Review>The film is so utterly transfixing you won't believe almost two-and-a-half hours have passed when the final credits roll.</Review>
            <Review>I would have preferred Jackson's clinically-presented project display a bit more reverence for the three young lives that were brutally taken some twenty years ago.</Review>

            <Review>A rudderless exercise in examination, ultimately the doc has no point of view, no upshot, and no reason for being.</Review>

            <Review>A feel-good story about an autistic man's quest for independence, The Story of Luke is a charming little film in need of a bit more grit.</Review>
            <Review>The first comedy gem of 2013.</Review>
            <Review>The outsized nature of their insensitivities is meant to reinforce the pain and humiliation from Luke's perspective, but it makes for a movie with an uneven tone.</Review>

            <Review>Theaters showing Storm Surfers 3D ought to create a splash zone. This exuberant documentary about the perennially stoked team of big-wave stalkers Tom Carroll and Ross Clarke-Jones takes audiences right into the barrel of the beast.</Review>
            <Review>We slowly learn to see the water through their eyes, recognizing the different perils between lazy deep sea giants and the more brutish, tight curls that spit the brave straight onto the rocks.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate/>
        <Duration>97</Duration>
        <StoryLine>A vacationing insomniac loses the ability to distinguish dreams from reality while traveling the Chilean countryside with a group of adventurers that includes her best friend and an enigmatic American in this downbeat saga. Though it came to the U.S. billed as a thriller or a horror picture, Chilean director Sebastian Silva's Magic Magic is more aptly described as a dark psychological drama with tense overtones. Juno Temple stars as Alicia - an emotionally fragile young woman in her early 20s with a murky history. She joins her cousin Sarah (Emily Browning), Sarah's boyfriend Agust�n (Agust�n Silva), the couple's eccentric friend Brink (Michael Cera) and Agust�n's sister Barbara (Catalina Sandina Moreno) for a retreat in the countryside, but from the beginning, things don't go as planned. In the days that follow, more tension erupts between Alicia and the other members of the group, particularly Brink, who displays extreme anti-social tendencies and grows fond of malevolently pushing the girl's buttons. After Sarah returns, all hell threatens to break loose: Alicia is accosted by a local dog that attempts to copulate with her leg; Brink and Agust�n play a dangerous game that threatens to cause Alicia grave physical harm, and it becomes increasingly apparent, throughout, that Alicia is now teetering on the brink of a full-scale mental breakdown, which terrifies the others. ~ Nathan Southern, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>Meticulously acted, gorgeously shot and hilariously insightful about the strange, inarticulable ways people can get on one another's nerves, this psychological thriller takes its premise to surprising, darkly comic extremes ...</Review>
            <Review>It's refreshing to see something with a dramatic heart beating beneath its discomfiting exterior.</Review>
            <Review>It's a big load of much-ado-about-nothing dressed up in writer- director Sebastian Silva's arty movements.</Review>
            <Review>Magic Magic's odd denouement is a dramatic curveball that smacks the viewer square in the face.</Review>
            <Review>A shapeless mess.</Review>
            <Review>Silva, like all good film-makers, is a magician. But thanks to the last-minute fumbling, we're left with a broken spell.</Review>
            <Review>Magic Magic is skewered on the horns of a dilemma, uncertain whether it's a horror film or a psychological drama -- and it doesn't work especially well as either.</Review>
            <Review>The plaudits rest with [Juno] Temple, whose white-faced panic carries her over plot weaknesses through sheer force of will.</Review>
            <Review>Juno Temple is sensational in this assured psychological thriller from Sebastián Silva.</Review>
            <Review>Another satisfyingly nasty and well-controlled work from Silva.</Review>
            <Review>With some haunting imagery and an unusual, throbbing sense of dread throughout, this is a trippy twist on the horror trope about sadists and innocents.</Review>

        <Duration>90</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Thure Lindhardt (Keep the Lights On) stars in this quirky dark comedy as Lars, a former darling of the art scene slipping away into the land of has-beens and struggling with lack of inspiration. His art dealer Ronny arranges a teaching job in a small town as a "therapeutic measure" to stir up some creative juices, but things never turn out quite as planned. At first, life in the peaceful small town seems rosy, as the young man settles in and impresses beautiful fellow colleague Leslie, by taking in the brawny, mute Eddie after the latter's caregiver passes away. But Lars soon discovers that the fa�ade of serenity hides something unimaginable: Eddie suffers from a rare form of sleepwalking that transforms him from docile, cereal-obsessed art student into ravenous sleepwalking cannibal craving fresh meat. Initially horrified by Eddie's dark secret, Lars becomes enthralled by the not-so-gentle giant: at long last, here's the muse he'd been searching for high and low! Exceptional art does indeed come at a very high price, even the cost of human lives...and how far is Lars willing to go for his next masterpiece?</StoryLine>

            <Review>This deliberately tasteless horror-comedy might appeal to gore hounds and fans of gross-out humor; but as with many films that strive for cult status, any potential exploitation-movie pleasures are overwhelmed by an air of smug self-awareness.</Review>
            <Review>Thankfully, Lindhardt keeps things together with an appealing performance that constantly oscillates between drama and very light, dry humor without sacrificing the slightly otherworldly nature of his character.</Review>
            <Review>This would-be cult item runs out of steam after its establishes its wickedly satirical premise.</Review>
            <Review>Despite the theme, "Eddie" goes easy on gratuitous gore. What we get is a cerebral horror movie and a satire of the art world.</Review>
            <Review>A flawed but diverting meditation on finding inspiration while losing your soul.</Review>
            <Review>Beneath the surface outrageousness lies a surprisingly, satisfyingly dark little fable about the essentially cannibalistic nature of artistic inspiration.</Review>
            <Review>The results may get muddled when tonal shifts are forced, but Eddie nonetheless entertains with enough originality to forgive its otherwise familiar tropes.</Review>
            <Review>Boris Rodriguez's movie sadly ends up being neither an effective horror movie nor a memorable satire. It just kind of, pardon me for going there, sleepwalks through its clever set-up.</Review>
            <Review>A quirky but unfulfilling Canadian-Danish horror-comedy that has a substantial helping of originality on its side, but not much in the way of inspired execution.</Review>
            <Review>It's not often I question content in a horror film, but after sleepwalking dully through Rodriguez's movie, I can only shrug and ask myself what just happened - with the least amount of interest.</Review>
            <Review>A dark comedy driven by spot-on digs at academia, cutthroat art-world competition and the quest for inspiration.</Review>
            <Review>Because the film clearly aims for satire, Boris Rodriguez isn't entirely guilty of indulging gruesome spectacle for its own sake.</Review>

Through lectures and physical combat training, the girls learn what it means to be good Hindu women.

        <StoryLine>Between 1975 and 1979, the Khmer Rouge regime caused the death of some 1.8 million people, representing one-quarter of the population of Cambodia. Kaing Guek Eav, better known as Duch, was in charge at M13, a Khmer Rouge-controlled prison, for four years before being appointed by the Angkar ("the Organization," a faceless and omnipresent entity which reigned unopposed over the destiny of an entire people) to the S21 center in Phnom Penh. As party secretary, he commanded from 1975 to 1979 the Khmer Rouge killing machine in which at least 12,280 people perished, according to the remaining archives. But how many others disappeared, "crushed and reduced to dust," with no trace of them ever being found? In 2009, Duch became the first leader of the Khmer Rouge organization to be brought before an international criminal justice court. Rithy Panh records his unadorned words, without any trimmings...</StoryLine>

        <Title>Sushi: The Global Catch</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2012</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>75</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Sushi, a cuisine formerly found only in Japan, has grown exponentially in other nations, and an industry has been created to support it. In a rush to please a hungry public, the expensive delicacy has become common and affordable, appearing in restaurants, supermarkets and even fast food trailers. The traditions requiring 7 years of apprenticeship in Japan have given way to quick training and mass-manufactured solutions elsewhere. This hunger for sushi has led to the depletion of apex predators in the ocean, including bluefin tuna, to such a degree that it has the potential to upset the ecological balance of the world's oceans, leading to a collapse of all fish species. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>Unlike the recent Jiro Dreams of Sushi, it doesn't inspire conflicting feelings of guilt and hunger -- it's nearly devoid of fish fetishism.</Review>
            <Review>It isn't all bad news in a doc suggesting sustainability and culinary pleasure aren't mutually exclusive.</Review>
            <Review>The film's arguments about sustainability are convincing and hard to shake. And, the movie suggests, you - the sushi eater - can help: Crave it and enjoy it, but eat sushi responsibly.</Review>
            <Review>The Global Catch may be one-sided in its argument, but it's a persuasive one -- and the next time you eat sushi, you may think twice about ordering bluefin.</Review>

            <Review>The initially-promising story about a haunted woman who travels back in time to reveal the truth is as unconvincing as they come.</Review>
            <Review>Lustig strains for poetic meaning but comes up empty-handed. Unless, that is, you happen to like cod-Freudian naval-gazing.</Review>
            <Review>A Thousand Kisses Deep certainly has ambitions, but the film struggles to lives up to the Leonard Cohen poem it's named after.</Review>
            <Review>Scant time travel logic aside, Dana Lustig might finally have found her groove with this unassuming, low-budget sci-fi.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2010</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>85</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Based on the acclaimed book by ecologist and cancer survivor Sandra Steingraber, Ph.D., Living Downstream is an eloquent and cinematic documentary film. This poetic film follows Sandra during one pivotal year as she travels across North America, working to break the silence about cancer and its environmental links. After a routine cancer screening, Sandra receives some worrying results and is thrust into a period of medical uncertainty. Thus, we begin two journeys with Sandra: her private struggles with cancer and her public quest to bring attention to the urgent human rights issue of cancer prevention. But Sandra is not the only one who is on a journey-the chemicals against which she is fighting are also on the move. We follow these invisible toxins as they migrate to some of the most beautiful places in North America. We see how these chemicals enter our bodies and how, once inside, scientists believe they may be working to cause cancer. Several experts in the fields of toxicology and cancer research make important cameo appearances in the film, highlighting their own findings on two pervasive chemicals: atrazine, one of the most widely used herbicides in the world, and the industrial compounds, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Their work further illuminates the significant connection between a healthy environment and human health. At once Sandra's personal journey and her scientific exploration, Living Downstream is a powerful reminder of the intimate connection between the health of our bodies and the health of our air, land, and water.</StoryLine>

        <Title>Robert Williams Mr. Bitchin'</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>89</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Robert Williams was an artist in search of a movement. A prolific oil painter, whose painstakingly detailed work often featured naked women, death, destruction, booze and clowns, he didn't quite fit the fine art mold. In the early 1960s he was confronted with trendy abstraction and superficial pop art. Schooled in the Hot Rod Culture of Ed "Big Daddy" Roth and Von Dutch, he emerged as a leader in the Underground Comic revolution along with R. Crumb, contributing regularly to Zap Comix. His antisocial paintings of an alternative reality were marginalized by the art world for decades although he became a hero of sorts for underground artists. His notoriety exploded when his painting Appetite for Destruction was used (and much vilified) as the cover for that 1987 Guns N' Roses' album. When he started Juxtapoz Magazine in 1994, his movement found him. Legions of artists looking for a place within the contemporary art world for their cartoonish realism identified with his "LowBrow" aesthetic. At the time, Williams predicted that, "Low brow and alternative art are the crack in the dam and with this leak the art world will never be the same." By 2010 the art world could ignore him no longer and he was included in the prestigious Whitney Biennial at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. ROBERT WILLIAMS MR. BITCHIN documents this influential artist as he rises to the top of the art world, always an outsider. (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

He traverses time to right a violent, decades-past crime against his mother, but the ripples of his good intentions prove disastrous, as a fractured, alternate reality now exists in place of the familiar one. Stumbling through this twisted reality where even Superman is nowhere to be found, The Flash seeks the trusted wisdom of Batman, only to find a grittier, more violent Dark Knight in his place. Together with the help of Cyborg, they race to restore the continuity of Flash's original timeline while this new world is ravaged by a fierce war between Wonder Woman's Amazons and the Atlanteans, led by a battle hardened Aquaman. With breath taking action and an all-star voice cast featuring Kevin Conroy, C.

            <Review>The film doesn't so much unfold as detonate. It's a swift kick in the pants at 66 minutes and utilizes a deft blend of archival footage, graphs, subject interviews and bites from knowledgeable talking heads such as David Carr.</Review>

        <StoryLine>The Demented follows six college friends as they meet up for a carefree weekend in a beautiful rural home. A terrorist missile attack in a nearby town infects much of the townspeople with a deadly virus that induces rabies-like symptoms...with devastating consequences. Ravenous and fast, the infected townspeople turn their sights on the vacation home where the friends are gathered...and are now barricaded. How long can they hide? Even with the infected "sleeping" in the streets, can they make their escape? If so, to what?</StoryLine>

            <Review>It's too bad the makers didn't do a slightly better job casting the key roles, but taken on its own terms the 95-minute Disney Channel original plays like a brightly colored beach blanket, albeit one that's a little rough around its sandy edges.</Review>
            <Review>So we have a fundamentally earnest movie that mocks tongue-in-cheek movies for their earnestness.</Review>
            <Review>The push-and-pull between the two [main characters] is a delightful dynamic, setting the tone for other fantastic character interplays and some entertaining turns of events.</Review>
            <Review>A more entertaining, clever musical than its generic title suggests.</Review>
            <Review>Keeps its eye firmly on paying tribute to the classic Beach movies, all with pretty great numbers that feel like they were written in the early sixties.</Review>

        <Duration>93</Duration>
        <StoryLine>This hilarious foul-mouthed, lesbian road movie co-stars Oscar (R)-winning actresses Brenda Fricker and Olympia Dukakis as Dot and Stella, a crackerjack lesbian couple on the run from a nursing home. You'll laugh so hard you'll cry. Stella and Dot have been together for 31 years and have faithfully accompanied one another through life's ups and downs. Now in their seventies, Stella is hard of hearing and Dot is legally blind. Dotty's prudish granddaughter, Molly (played by Genie Award-winner Kristin Booth), decides the best place for Dot is a nursing home that will provide all the necessities. This forces Stella and Dot to make a bold decision: they will leave their hometown and make their way to Canada, where same-sex marriage is legal. It's a last-gap bid to stay together. En route to Canada, they pick up a young hitchhiker, Prentice, played by newcomer Ryan Doucette. A small-town boy turned modern dancer, he is returning to Nova Scotia to visit his dying mother. Despite his bravado, Prentice is a confused and wounded soul who has much to learn from Stella and Dot as they wage their own unexpected battle - after three decades, can they keep their family together?

            <Review>It's a delight to see Olympia Dukakis and Brenda Fricker, superb talents and Oscar winners both, share almost every frame of Cloudburst.</Review>
            <Review>An affectionate twist on a classic tale of lovers on the lam, sprinkled with renegade hints of Thelma &amp; Louise, Cloudburst is a life- and heart-affirming journey.</Review>
            <Review>The two actors...bring out the best in these two women in spite of the plot lapses and odd tonal shifts...you believe wholeheartedly that these two are deeply in love, and Dukakis and Fricker gift their characters with a real bond of intimacy.</Review>
            <Review>A rough-edged Olympia Dukakis steals much of this comedy road movie about two ageing lesbians who go to Canada to get married. Enjoyable, but unremarkable.</Review>
            <Review>In its peaceful moments, it's a gem, but the wild stabs at wacky comedy are usually groaners, a shame in a story that's so smart and savvy when it isn't showing off, being dense, or winding down to a painfully pat ending.</Review>

            <Review>Did you think a second G.I. Joe movie was a good idea?</Review>
            <Review>The filmmakers appear to have handed a dozen or so G.I. Joe dolls to a 9-year-old, watched him play for 110 minutes, and then shot a scene-for-scene remake.</Review>
            <Review>What a blast G.I. Joe: Retaliation is! And then another blast, and another, in a series of concussive jolts that shred any conventional sense of story as thoroughly as anything since the last Michael Bay film.</Review>
            <Review>When it comes to big and loud, this is the movie to beat for at least this week; what makes it entertaining is its unabashed wallow in these qualities ...</Review>
            <Review>Plays like a tiresomely extended evening of channel surfing.</Review>
            <Review>No go, "Joe."</Review>
            <Review>Retaliation takes itself about as seriously as it should. Which is to say, not very. The dialogue is light and breezy, filled with jokes and sarcastic asides.</Review>
            <Review>It's probably not a stretch to note that G.I. Joe: Retaliation improves considerably over its 2009 predecessor, G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra...</Review>
            <Review>Amidst a couple of nice action beats, there's plenty of stilted dialogue, poorly drawn characters, and heaps of generic rock music.</Review>
            <Review>A terrible film with a confusing plot, jarring tonal fluctuations, characters that engender no sympathy, and a strangely flippant attitude toward violence.</Review>
            <Review>Bruce Willis, The Rock, explosions, comedy and action help this popcorn sequel rise above its more Sci-Fi predecessor, but even fans caught up in the action will occasionally find this live action film to be just a bit too cartoonish.</Review>
            <Review>A very flawed film, but it's superior to the first installment in every way.</Review>

        <StoryLine>FILLY BROWN is an inspiring and gritty portrait of a young artist's striving to find her voice and seize her dreams without compromise. Majo Tonorio, a.k.a. "Filly Brown," is a raw, young Los Angeles hip-hop artist who spits rhymes from the heart. With an incarcerated mother, and a father struggling to provide for his daughters, a record contract could be the ticket out for her family. But when a record producer offers Majo a crack at stardom, she is suddenly faced with losing who she is as an artist and the friends who helped her reach the cusp of success. Directed by Youssef Delara and Michael Olmos, fused with a fierce hip-hop score, and propelled by an exceptional cast which features Lou Diamond Philips, Edward James Olmos, and the legendary Jenni Rivera in her final on-screen performance, FILLY BROWN heralds the arrival of Gina Rodriguez in the electrifying title role.

            <Review>However much earnest commitment and passion that the cast lend to their roles, it ultimately cannot overcome the routine structure and approach to the overall execution.</Review>
            <Review>The movie works best as a showcase for Rodriguez, transcending its simplistic script and clichéd plot in snatches -- when its leading lady is at the mike and especially in the film's final awkward family reunion.</Review>

        <StoryLine>On the verge of a forced retirement, Don Celso, an elderly office worker begins to relive both real and imagined memories from his life - a trip to the movies as a young boy with Beethoven, listening to tall tales from Long John Silver, a brief stay in a haunted hotel. Stories hide within stories and the thin line between imagination and reality steadily erodes, opening up a marvelous new world of personal remembrance and fantastic melodrama. In this playfully elegiac film, loosely adapted from the fantastical short stories of Chilean writer Hern�n del Solar, Raul Ruiz (MYSTERIES OF LISBON) has crafted a final masterwork on his favorite subjects: fiction, history and life itself.

            <Review>Elegiac, witty and deeply reflective, "Night Across the Street" strikes a mature and complex tone.</Review>
            <Review>It all has a sense of regret and almost relief. It haunts.</Review>
            <Review>Raúl Ruiz's elegiac, enigmatic and mischievous final film.</Review>
            <Review>Unusually suffused with the contrast between experience and memory, reality and surreality.</Review>
            <Review>These are the dreams of a man stepping out of this world, perhaps never more lucid and full of life.</Review>
            <Review>The way Ruiz uses such giddy flourishes in the name of looking back on one's life is both thrillingly irreverent and surprisingly moving.</Review>
            <Review>Past, present, and future, and illusion and reality, dissolve as the film's scenes line up like marbles, all of equal weight and value.</Review>
            <Review>The arty, poignant and thought-provoking sentimental film, about life as a never-ending journey, should appeal mostly to Ruiz's devoted fan base.</Review>
            <Review>The film's like wandering unescorted in someone else's mind ... It becomes more beautifully melancholic as you remember it.</Review>
            <Review>Playful and wildly imaginative to the last, this film shows Ruiz going out dreaming, and laughing.</Review>
            <Review>Across the film's second half, as is sometimes his wont, Ruiz begins to cast aside the genteel, tradition-of-quality trappings misleadingly suggested by the first act and indulges in the lurid fancy of pulp fiction and horror.</Review>
            <Review>Pleasurably disorienting.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>97</Duration>
        <StoryLine>A security guard for an armored truck, Jim (Dominic Purcell) is a blue-collar New Yorker who works hard to earn a living. His wages support himself and his wife Rosie (Erin Karpluk), who is on the upswing recovering from a near-fatal illness. Yet things start to fall apart after Rosie's health insurance stops covering her treatment and Jim's life savings are lost via a disastrous investment his stockbroker had advised him to make. As a row of professional and personal dominoes falls, Jim is confronted by the realization that, after being abused and exploited by financial institutions for far too long, he has only one choice: to strike back. From the mind of notorious German writer/director Uwe Boll (House of the Dead), ASSAULT ON WALL STREET is excoriating look at the American financial system that is sure to stir up plenty of Occupy-esque sentiment.

            <Review>The film seems inexplicably tame, the least interesting execution of a radical concept.</Review>
            <Review>Boll spends so much time painting Jim into the corner required to "justify" his bonkers actions that once the film's fuse is irrevocably lighted, viewers may have already checked out.</Review>
            <Review>This zeitgeist-tapping revenge fantasy doesn't deliver enough guilty pleasures.</Review>
            <Review>It's as subtle and as silly as you would expect, with an ending that's both a rally cry and request for a sequel.</Review>
            <Review>Seemingly inspired by "Taxi Driver" with its security guard stand-in for Travis Bickle wasting Wall Street brokers who are arguably worse than the pimps in "Taxi Driver".</Review>
            <Review>Because it wouldn't be Boll if there wasn't borderline irresponsible storytelling.</Review>
            <Review>Possibly the only director on the planet who has garnered a strange recognition through utter infamy, Boll engages in a weirdly raw and rowdy subversive ideological descent into the dysfunctionally dark recesses of US culture.</Review>
            <Review>Uwe Boll's insistence on plugging genre tropes into his imagined idea of populism returns us to the same cynical place as Postal, except with none of the sizzle.</Review>

            <Review>'Black Rock' is never dull, but it's hardly the attention-grabbing calling card its creator presumably intended.</Review>
            <Review>The writing tanks while the actors try to stay above water, but nobody leaves a trace on the radar.</Review>
            <Review>This is a lean and mean variation on a familiar theme, tense throughout, with some terrific performances.</Review>
            <Review>It seemed that Black Rock might take its very basic premise and use it as a platform to explore larger ideas. But even on its own terms as just a lean-and-mean genre exercise, this one's not all that interesting.</Review>
            <Review>Aselton, you sure have a purty mouth, but what are you trying to say?</Review>
            <Review>This indie, female-centric riff on "Deliverance" is spare, smartly written and shot through with moments of twig-snapping tension.</Review>
            <Review>Black Rock is much more complex than your average run-of-the-mill "run from danger, pretty lady" kind of movie.</Review>
            <Review>A tight-fisted little piece of gender-centric survival horror.</Review>
            <Review>Black Rock is a simplistic, predictable thriller that fails to become engaging thanks to idiotic characters and a by the numbers approach that has the audience two steps ahead of them.</Review>
            <Review>This isn't quite the distaff Deliverance promised, but it's a credible indie thriller with characters worth caring about.</Review>
            <Review>We've seen Duplass write scripts that break cinema conventions like this, but who knew that his actress wife Aselton would turn out to be an equally innovative director?</Review>
            <Review>Aselton does demonstrate an assured touch in the early character-based scenes, but she lacks the same control when it comes to handling the action.</Review>

Neal (Jonny Weston, Chasing Mavericks) has returned from a two-year exile following his tragic attempt to defeat the monster, only to find his father ticking ever closer to a breakdown, a new stepmother who fears him, and his little brother Paul (Gattlin Griffith, Green Lantern, Changeling), terrorized by the same monster. While Neal and Paul work together to try and fight the nocturnal menace, their parents are taking desperate measures to get the family back to normal. With no support from their parents, the brothers have nothing to rely on but each other, and courage beyond belief.(c) XLRator</StoryLine>

            <Review>Matches narrative incoherence with one of the most over-the-top portentous scores in horror-cinema history.</Review>
            <Review>Once, however, the monster comes out of its hiding place and sheds its psychosexual slough, all that remains is a silly, sub-Joe Dante clash between kids and creature, with a dénouement so bewilderingly arbitrary that disappointment is inevitable.</Review>
            <Review>Kids vs. monsters tale that take a while to warm up, but picks up nicely.</Review>
            <Review>A standard-issue creepshow, undermined by script holes and a meager budget that brings distinctly subpar effects.</Review>

            <Review>Unfolds with a nuance and relative level of sophistication that belies its generic title, before eventually succumbing to a haphazard, poorly explained explosion of gore.</Review>
            <Review>The film's sense of conviction and psychological nuance never rises above that of the "I Learned It from Watching You" anti-drug PSA.</Review>
            <Review>What the production aims to pull off with the picture in the early going isn't where the movie ends up, torching a promising premise on tiresome storytelling and a mangled tonal balance.</Review>
            <Review>Under The Bed offers a fresh take on the fabled boogeyman story, delivering an entertaining explanation of what exactly is going "bump in the night" - along with one hell of a horror finale.</Review>

        <StoryLine>THE SILENCE begins 23 years ago on a hot summer day, when a young girl named Pia is brutally murdered in a field of wheat by Peer (Ulrich Thomsen-In a Better World, Fear Me Not), as his helpless friend Timo (Wotan Wilke Moehring-Soul Kitchen) watches. Now, in the present day, on the exact same date, 13-year-old Sinikka is missing, her bicycle abandoned in the same spot, leading police to suspect the same killer may be at work again. Recently widowed detective David (Sebastian Blombeg-The Baader Meinhof Complex) and his colleague Janna (Jule Boewe) struggle to solve the mystery of these parallel crimes with the help of Krischan (Burghart Klaussner-The White Ribbon, The Edukators), the retired investigator of the unresolved case. While Sinikka's distraught parents are trapped in an agonizing period of waiting and uncertainty, their daughter's fate rips open unhealed wounds in the heart of Pia's mother (Katrin Sass, Goodbye Lenin) and sends Timo in search of Peer and their own old desires.

            <Review>Twisted, sad and undeniably disturbing, "The Silence" is a study in the sick ways of men.</Review>
            <Review>This is film noir at its noirest.</Review>
            <Review>A story of obsession, of the permanence of loss, of how deeds of the past haunt us, closing over our heads like water. It leaves you shivering, yet thrilled; waiting anxiously for this talented new filmmaker's next work.</Review>
            <Review>"The Silence" is framed as a multi-character police procedural, but like "Mystic River" and "Zodiac," its inquiries probe deeper and darker.</Review>
            <Review>Its measured pacing whispers art while its lurid subject matter screams commerce.</Review>
            <Review>The most rewarding element in the picture is the performance of the first girl's mother by Katrin Sass, who gives us quietly and darkly what it is like to live with the memory of your child's murder.</Review>
            <Review>This stylish effort from director Baran bo Odar should please fans of Scandinavian crime dramas or the British "Red Riding" trilogy.</Review>
            <Review>Stunning performances and cinematography - too bad the plot machinations don't compare.</Review>
            <Review>If you're in the mood for an offbeat police procedural, this should be on your must-see list ... Who would have thought something this unrelievedly grim could be, at its dark heart, about unrequited love?</Review>
            <Review>How might criminals who get away with murder behave, the movie asks? Just like everyone else.</Review>
            <Review>...part police procedural and part psychological study, with more than just genre thrills to offer.</Review>

The story is told through the words of renowned surfers and marine forecasters. The anticipation of the swell's arrival provides a glimpse into the lives of this select group of people that make these massive winter waves their passion bordering on obsession. In the process, it explains how and why such waves come into being and what they are capable of. In the end, the film provides a chance to witness a group of people tempt fate in one of the most dramatic and frightening ways conceivable, but also see nature in one of its truly powerful and graceful moments.</StoryLine>

            <Review>The easiest and most honest line on Detention of the Dead is that it's better than it has any reasonable right or need to be, given its aims.</Review>
            <Review>While it features some pleasing tech credits and an engaged cast, the effort swings too wildly from sensitivity to slapstick, resulting in a disagreeably disorienting viewing experience.</Review>
            <Review>It hits way more than it misses, and there are some truly shining moments strewn throughout the flick to keep even the hungriest of gorehounds satisfied.</Review>

            <Review>Neither particularly fast nor furious.</Review>
            <Review>Vehicle 19 sets up a fascinating conceit for itself, and then loses interest in delivering on it. It just wants to get to the cool car chase, but by the time it does, we've stopped caring.</Review>
            <Review>Mr. Walker's character is haunted by a troubled past, but the film would have been better if it had given him more to do in the present.</Review>
            <Review>The plot is brainless even for a Paul Walker movie. Get ready for "The Slow and the Spurious."</Review>
            <Review>A lean, low-budget and claustrophobic mistaken-identity thriller that's so stripped-down, it's nearly nonexistent.</Review>
            <Review>[Walker] is forced to really act here. It's a task he faces with admirable dedication, if not unqualified success.</Review>
            <Review>The degree to which Vehicle 19 flounders and ultimately fails is, to put it mildly, rather disappointing...</Review>
            <Review>neither Walker nor the script can keep your interest for the duration, with action set pieces and intrusive music overpowering what should have been a claustrophobic and tense experience</Review>
            <Review>The script is overwhelmed by cliches and implausibilities.</Review>
            <Review>Low-tech and initially diverting, the feature soon rides on dramatically bald tires with Walker in the lead role, unable to squeeze out the necessary anguish to communicate the wrong place, wrong time feel of the script.</Review>

            <Review>"Love and Honor'' may be politically clueless, but Hemsworth and the student journalist he hooks up with (fellow Aussie Teresa Palmer of "Warm Bodies'') do make an undeniably attractive couple.</Review>
            <Review>This trifle about two soldiers who sneak away to America while on leave unfolds in a world about as realistic as a flashback on a sitcom.</Review>
            <Review>Hemsworth has presence, but he also represents this film's biggest problem: It feels like a bunch of good-looking kids putting on a show.</Review>
            <Review>Everybody learns something about the illusion of love and the power of honor. It's hard to believe it wasn't written by Nicholas Sparks.</Review>
            <Review>It's a lightweight drama filled with heavyweight war-is-hell monologues, delivered by a cast that lacks the gravity to sell them.</Review>
            <Review>little more than a counterfeit Nicholas Sparks adaptation</Review>
            <Review>A well meaning but essentially dopey period piece film that tries with increasingly diminishing effectiveness to meld an anti-war message with Nicholas Sparks-type romance.</Review>
            <Review>The attempt at gritty period re-creation seems half-hearted and unconvincing, the screenplay is strictly formula, and most of the primary actors have done better work elsewhere.</Review>
            <Review>Totally bogus anti-war film, set in a 1969 that bears no resemblance to any actual period.</Review>
            <Review>Love and Honor is capable of much more than predictable melodrama, though director Danny Mooney seems absolutely determined to ease this effort into a honeyed coma as quickly as possible.</Review>

            <Review>New World tries to expand the genre with nods to The Godfather but can't escape the over-the-top acting, expansive violence and overdone story typical of Seoul-made crime dramas.</Review>
            <Review>"New World" is both less bloody and more thoughtful than most of its genre, the shifting-alliances plot becoming more engrossing as it progresses.</Review>
            <Review>No one in American movies has made a crime opera this good in years.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director Hoon-jung Park tells this twisty story of internecine warfare within a Korean corporate crime syndicate with patience, elegance and no small amount of bloodshed.</Review>
            <Review>Like many of his SK-action peers, director Park Hoon-jung has a knack for staging violent set pieces but comes up lacking in terms of character development, narrative clarity, etc.</Review>
            <Review>Park's direction is sleek and assured, but lacking the dynamism that might help energize a film that-its title notwithstanding-comes off as dully old-school.</Review>
            <Review>While Park Hoon-jeong's gangster film seems to celebrate the genre rather than adding a whole lot, it's reflective of a self-conscious style that's helping South Korean directors turn a few heads.</Review>
            <Review>Tense, dark, violent and brilliantly acted, if New World is any indication of what's in store for the future of the Asian cop drama; harder, sharper, yet finessed and even elegant, then carry on Korea.</Review>
            <Review>Living up to the core of the noir tradition, New World takes a long view of the human species and dissects us with the cold, surgical blade of a laboratory scientist.</Review>
            <Review>Smart, sharp entertainment that meets expectations dead on...if you've been looking for another The Departed-esque movie to keep you guessing, this would be a good place to start.</Review>
            <Review>Reverse-engineered from several gangster classics, New World is like the knockoff shades and counterfeit wristwatches its antihero complains about: flashy but ultimately cheap.</Review>
            <Review>New World is just an intense crime thriller that is solid from beginning to end no matter how you look at it.</Review>

            <Review>Trance is high-order, film noir nonsense that takes Boyle back to the thrillers he made at the start of his career with John Hodge (he wrote Trance, too), like Shallow Grave and Trainspotting, that were preoccupied with the grimy corners of the psyche.</Review>
            <Review>Trance is to Danny Boyle more or less as Side Effects was to Steven Soderbergh: an arty spin on a trashy B-movie, engineered to showcase the director's particular gifts.</Review>
            <Review>The story draws us in even through the murk.</Review>
            <Review>Dawson walks through this film with majestic confidence while McAvoy is constantly inches from a full breakdown. And Boyle keeps that tension mesmerizing.</Review>
            <Review>I came away wondering whether the headache I left the theater with was such a bad -- or even unintentional -- thing after all.</Review>
            <Review>The plot of Trance is purposely convoluted - you're supposed to get more and more confused as the story unfolds, not always sure if what you're watching is a dream.</Review>
            <Review>Trance is your biennial reminder that Danny Boyle is one of our greatest living directors.</Review>
            <Review>It's not that I don't think Boyle knows, by the time things start to get really bananas in the second half, that his movie is silly. I'm jut not convinced that he ever decided how he felt about it.</Review>
            <Review>It's a deliriously head-spinning exercise in light and sound, attacking the audience's senses while spitting in the face of linear storytelling, smiling all the while.</Review>

            <Review>A high-concept comedy that peddles some slapstick laughs and life lessons but little insight.</Review>
            <Review>This is froth, but it's good froth.</Review>
            <Review>Rather than a jolting shot of joe, this French-Canadian comedy is a soothing cup of warm cocoa.</Review>
            <Review>"Starbuck" is essentially a situation comedy, but what a situation.</Review>
            <Review>Never mind high concept, this is high conception.</Review>
            <Review>"Starbuck" is one of those high-concept yet formulaic, sitcom-like comedies that gets by on charm and speed.</Review>
            <Review>Like they say in the sperm-donation business, it's all in the genes, and Huard possesses the ideal DNA to breed 'Starbuck' into quite a stud.</Review>
            <Review>The other reason "Starbuck" succeeds as a movie is that it goes more for the heart than for the big laughs.</Review>
            <Review>Despite (or because of) Huard's mugging, 'Starbuck' is more likely to cause queasiness than smiles of contentment.</Review>
            <Review>It's a far-fetched premise, though one that's brought down to Earth by Scott's emotionally upbeat writing, his brisk direction, and Huard's nimble, large-hearted performance.</Review>
            <Review>What begins as a cute idea grows annoyingly sentimental before it is through.</Review>

            <Review>It becomes something of a disquisition on mortality in spite of itself.</Review>

            <Review>Part of the pleasure of watching a movie like "Welcome to the Punch" is peeling away the multiple layers of inspiration, isolating the allusions and figuring out if they're what works or whether the movie earns a little credit.</Review>
            <Review>Welcome to the Punch is a crowd-pleaser with a minimalistic attitude.</Review>
            <Review>While it remains mildly entertaining throughout, Welcome to the Punch lacks the snap, crackle, and pop of other contemporary examples of the genre</Review>
            <Review>Welcome To The Punch should feel a little grander, like it's on a bigger scale to match the wide-ranging plot.</Review>

Minnie Driver plays Viv, a fiery high school drama teacher determined to fire up her hormonal, apathetic students by putting on the best end-of-the-year show the school has ever seen... a glam rock-infused musical version of Shakespeare's The Tempest. But as the Welsh summer begins to heat up, can she compete with the typical teenage distractions of sex and drugs with some great rock and roll? Find out in this fantastic, rousing film- but remove all fears of the typical teen-pop covered high school musicals from your minds, as the songs in this film are from legendary artists like David Bowie, The Beach Boys, ELO, and The Byrds.

            <Review>Mesmerizing and haunting, "The Jeffrey Dahmer Files" is an inside-out serial killer movie, lacking in gore or cheap psychology and made in part for those who think they never want to see another serial killer movie.</Review>

            <Review>Thompson does a commendable job of making his points without overstaying his welcome. Given a bigger budget and better resources, it would be very interesting to see his take on some other controversial cases.</Review>
            <Review>This approach to a true-crime documentary departs significantly from the sensational, and is all the more moving because of it.</Review>

            <Review>Coming from anyone else, Ginger &amp; Rosa would be a sensitive if predictable coming-of-age tale set in the mists of the distant past. But coming from writer-director Sally Potter, it's a major surprise.</Review>
            <Review>A near-flawless film, beautifully shot and cut, excitingly performed and deeply felt.</Review>
            <Review>Fanning is nearly perfect as Ginger navigates choppier waters than most teens have to. There is not a false note in her performance; no matter how melodramatic things become, everything about Ginger remains genuine.</Review>
            <Review>Elle Fanning is scary. Scarily good.</Review>
            <Review>In all respects, this is the completely captivating Fanning's picture.</Review>
            <Review>Potter has a rich compositional eye, but she wisely trims the fat from the dialogue, which dances around most of the melodrama until an explosive last act.</Review>
            <Review>After a career defined by cinematic experimentation, director Sally Potter trades affectation and stylistic experimentation for not-so-simple intimacy and empathy, helped of course by rich performances from her cast, young and not-so-young.</Review>
            <Review>Anchored by a brilliant performance from young Elle Fanning, who renders the usual teen angst and disillusionment as something both deeply felt and oddly mysterious. The kid is a natural.</Review>
            <Review>Ginger and Rosa is a small flick that reminds audiences how exciting it is to see raw and sincere performances despite what kind of package they're delivered in</Review>
            <Review>Fanning's illuminating, naturalistic performance...is the best reason to see the movie</Review>
            <Review>Much of the night work,especially candlelit, puts "Ginger &amp; Rosa" in the fashion of a memory piece rather than an objective history.But, as in all of Potter's work, it is an estimable and lush solution to the most minimal of budgets.</Review>
            <Review>As good as the movie is performance-wise, [director Sally] Potter allows the pacing to drag frequently, meaning viewers must be patient with Ginger &amp; Rosa.</Review>

            <Review>There is a touch too much of the handheld camera, but in general one senses that the very quality of the way this film was made is one of its justifications for being and for its raw moments.</Review>
            <Review>After being subjected to disturbing scenes of abject cruelty, rape and torture, my reactions shifted from squeamish revulsion to a reluctant yet growing appreciation for Kim's thematic ambition.</Review>
            <Review>The film's big reveal may not come as that much of a surprise; you may figure out where it's going well before the end. But it's the getting there that is, if not exactly fun, then certainly hypnotic.</Review>
            <Review>Fascination returns at the stirring climax, when the plot neatly twists and the film's apparently simple message turns deeper, and blacker.</Review>
            <Review>A mother's love for her child takes on brutal new meaning in Pieta, a film by Kim Ki-duk that's as hard to watch as it is to forget.</Review>
            <Review>Like many South Korean films, revenge is a major theme here, although the way Kim handles it is particularly subtle and surprising: It sneaks up on you.</Review>
            <Review>It's agonising to watch the two lead performers going deep into the sludge.</Review>
            <Review>A vicious, torture-happy debt collector with some severe sexual peccadilloes is, erm, softened by the return of his estranged mother in Kim Ki-duk's deeply unsettling Pieta.</Review>
            <Review>Possesses a sad, quiet power. Kim's film isn't as a cool as those made by his compatriots. But it is, in its own way, just as memorable.</Review>
            <Review>Succeeds in repulsing and enlightening viewers simultaneously, even if its views on self-sacrifice and redemption are cynical.</Review>
            <Review>This is a grisly fable that never goes where we expect it to. And it has some important things to say about both revenge and sacrifice.</Review>
            <Review>Nasty is as nasty does, and this lurid if aspirational potboiler does its thing, but the camera could have been let in on the joke.</Review>

The second solo feature from Lithuanian director Kristina Buozyte, following her acclaimed 2008 debut The Collectress, the 2012 production Vanishing Waves confirms Buozyte as a major young talent whose frequently breathtaking visual and technical gifts are thankfully also matched by her interest in complex characterizations, adventurous narratives, and challenging themes.

            <Review>There are interesting themes: about how much of the impulse to love is hidden from the conscious mind, and how much of sex is fantasy. But the impact is diminished by lifeless leads.</Review>
            <Review>This Lithuanian love story from Kristina Buozyte offers a discomfiting blend of visual ecstasy and narrative sterility.</Review>
            <Review>Buozyte and her co-writer and "visual style author" Bruno Samper make the most of pricey-looking production design, cocooning their leads in soft white light, prowling dolly shots, and shimmering special effects.</Review>
            <Review>It's derivative to a fault-but a deserved midnight-movie cult following is all but assured.</Review>
            <Review>Plot and character sketchiness aside, though, Vanishing Waves is incredibly absorbing, because Buozyte and Samper are smart about how sexual urges can override all reason and obligation.</Review>
            <Review>...once the conceit is revealed, the attention-span vanishes.</Review>
            <Review>A scintillating sci-fi throwback, Vanishing Waves draws inspiration from Stanley Kubrick and Andrei Tarkovsky, among others, but without feeling plagiaristic.</Review>

        <StoryLine>A coming-of-age story set in a vast, cross-country landscape, Arcadia begins when twelve-year-old Greta's dad Tom (Academy Award nominated actor John Hawkes) wakes her up before dawn and crams her and her two siblings into a dented station wagon. They set off on a 3,000 mile journey from the New England woods to the California desert. On the way, Tom tells enchanting stories, paints pictures of a California paradise, and assures the kids that Mom will soon join them. Greta believes him at first, mesmerized by the strange new scenery and clinging to her stuffed bunny Harrison. Older sister Caroline nonchalantly accepts his stories, more focused on the boyfriend she's leaving behind. And nine-year-old Nat, too young to suspect a thing, is eager to see the epic Grand Canyon. But Tom's mood shifts as often as the landscape outside their window, and the kids soon find themselves in increasingly unpleasant and even dangerous situations. Mom's presence seems to recede further with every mile they travel. (c) Film Movement</StoryLine>

            <Review>Cassavetes can film an erotic encounter worthy of the 1970s and the golden age of sex scenes, and that is no small compliment these days.</Review>
            <Review>"Kiss of the Damned" tries to give the vampire movie something it most definitely does not need: class.</Review>
            <Review>What distinguishes Kiss Of The Damned is its look, which combines the garish gore and muted tones of '70s Euro-horror with the subtle glow of modern moviemaking; and its sound design, which frequently mixes in a hellish throb.</Review>
            <Review>We need our storytellers to do more than draw painfully obvious parallels between drinking blood and making love.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director Xan Cassavetes is trying to go beyond the usual boundaries of the vampire genre. She doesn't quite succeed, but at least she tries.</Review>
            <Review>The screenplay is cliched and simplistic melodrama that drags even if the images and some of the operatic music quotes are lush.</Review>
            <Review>Though high-brow, erotic and smart, the retro vampire pic lays an egg because its mostly foreign cast screws up the mood piece with uniformly wooden performances.</Review>
            <Review>a significantly more mature - and sexy - take on vampire romance, approaching its subject with sophistication and sensuality even as it indulges in gore and terror that's as metaphorical as it is visceral.</Review>
            <Review>Manages to add a new wrinkle to one of cinema's oldest and hoariest genres.</Review>

            <Review>The film feels increasingly exploitative as it becomes more overtly political, illustrating various forms of injustice with blunt, sensationalistic imagery.</Review>
            <Review>A potent combo of hostage thriller and high-impact morality play.</Review>
            <Review>The social and economic pitfalls facing the vast urban underclass of Manila's sprawling metropolitan area are depicted with unflinching regard in Ron Morales' observant low-budget Filipino feature, a blend of ruthless crime drama and grim thriller.</Review>

            <Review>Sometimes difficult to stomach, the film captures the fragility of normal life in such a hotbed of crime and disorder.</Review>
            <Review>Morales's often brutal morality tale has both a grim intensity and a shattering impact.</Review>
            <Review>Graceland is more concerned with the moral compromises of individuals than the greater failures of society.</Review>

            <Review>What Cianfrance has written has scraps of surprise and a fine chase sequence, but it doesn't reach for the stars or the emotional cosmos -- or, at least, it doesn't know how to get there.</Review>
            <Review>This naturalistic drama is ambitious to the point of being unwieldy... But once the story has advanced from one generation to the next and its thematic sweep has become apparent, these flaws seem much more tolerable.</Review>
            <Review>"Pines" is hardy stuff, but it's at its toughest when Gosling's on screen.</Review>
            <Review>The Place Beyond the Pines is hackneyed and dull: Not a single moment rings true.</Review>
            <Review>This is a story about legacy, the sins of the father, the restlessness in our souls. It's powerful, it's bold, it hits you hard.</Review>
            <Review>Cianfrance and his sterling cast keep it all together, vanquishing doubt and soap suds. There's a palpable sense of teamwork that brings out the best in all of these players.</Review>
            <Review>Its narrative riskiness and emotional avidity don't always make for the smoothest viewing experience. But Cianfrance seems less interested in a tidy chronicle than in exploring some threads, in creating a feeling and seeing where it goes.</Review>
            <Review>In the quietly decaying tragic-Americana setting of this fine film, the story is one of far-reaching repercussions, and how the loss of the father's virtue lands upon the son.</Review>
            <Review>Grand, plangent and innervating, Cianfrance's latest is more than adequate proof that he's as cut out for the big as for the small of cinema.</Review>
            <Review>It's rare to see a picture so bogged down by the breadth of its ambition, but Derek Cianfrance's second feature nearly collapses under its own weight.</Review>
            <Review>That said, there's something about The Place Beyond the Pines that grows on you-something tragic, something that sits uncomfortably in the gut.</Review>
            <Review>Derek Cianfrance could probably be a great filmmaker if he wasn't trying so hard to be a Great Filmmaker</Review>

            <Review>The film succeeds in reflecting the weird sweetness in Pepitone.</Review>
            <Review>This loving portrait of the angst-ridden comedian should well lift his profile.</Review>
            <Review>This is a portrait of an interesting and endearing misanthrope, but someone who we all know lives inside of us. Eddie's just more willing to put it all out there, to express that existential angst most modern people experience.</Review>
            <Review>The film's unvarying lack of drama or direction can be wearing, but the schlubby originality of its subject fully repays the longueurs.</Review>
            <Review>By turns robustly amusing and wistfully melancholy.</Review>
            <Review>Eddie Pepitone, perhaps the funniest stand-up comedian you've never heard of, gets a deserving close-up in the amusing, freewheeling documentary "The Bitter Buddha."</Review>
            <Review>Half successful standup comic Eddie Pepitone expands the screen from stage to life as he lives his part 24 hours a day.</Review>
            <Review>An enjoyable lighthearted watch about someone you want to root for to succeed.</Review>
            <Review>Forget the tears of a clown as it pertains to inner psychology of a comedian -- what about the rage of a clown? That's the principal focus of The Bitter Buddha, a doc that's too polite and removed.</Review>
            <Review>It's a solid doc.</Review>
            <Review>Few comics with this degree of rage have been this self-aware and comical about it. He's a fascinating blend of NYC anger and L.A. trends. He's a wannabe vegan with road rage. 'Nuff said.</Review>

            <Review>As virtual tourism, it's a success but as dramatic fare it's a distinctly thin bowl of zuppa.</Review>
            <Review>The feel is somewhat cloistered and the pace rarely gets the pulse racing but this is engaging and affecting stuff, handsomely shot and well acted: Ilaria Occhini is a stand-out as the grandmother.</Review>
            <Review>The film is beautifully shot and set in Lecce, in Puglia, so breathtaking scenery is an important character.</Review>
            <Review>It's bright and smart and ultimately surprisingly moving.</Review>
            <Review>It's nicely performed and reasonably amusing but it's hard to care about the rather self-absorbed characters and their cloistered universe.</Review>
            <Review>Ozpetek could have trimmed some of the sub-plots, but it's broadly amusing (especially when our hero's camp pals pitch up) and the performances are as warm as the southern setting.</Review>
            <Review>Quite possibly the most boring film of 2010.</Review>

            <Review>This Belgian adventure animation is a little forgettable and uninspiring thanks to its lack of enthusiasm and comic value, inconsistent pace and predictable storyline.</Review>

        <Duration>95</Duration>
        <StoryLine>New York City. Fall, 1995. Below the feet of Times Square tourists, down a long flight of stairs, is a world where topless dancers spin around poles and grind money out of the pockets of nameless faces. For most, it's a fantasy. For some, it's therapy. For a few, a confessional. But beyond the Main Stage, and behind the Men's Room door you'll find a different kind of performance going on - a grifter with more talent and charisma than most of the dancers. Meet Shoes, the bathroom attendant. He's been here three years. Will he stay, or will he go? All he knows, for now, is that as the masses enter, he has one objective - get whatever cash they're holding into his tip bowl. No easy task. And whether they leave money or not, one thing's for sure - they are no longer nameless, and whatever secrets they are trying to hide, are exposed in the bright light of the head.(c) Official Facebook</StoryLine>

            <Review>Griffith's wry dramedy is both a character study and a personal showcase, but his fatal flaw is that Shoes just isn't as interesting as the drunks, jerks, goons and dreamers who stumble into his lair to relieve themselves.</Review>

            <Review>Been there, done that.</Review>
            <Review>"Solomon Kane" succeeds by embracing its identity as a straightforward genre exercise, complete with bone-crunching and blood-spurting action. By not aiming for more, it hits its target.</Review>
            <Review>Who knew there were skinhead and zombie equivalents in late-Elizabethan England?</Review>
            <Review>It's hardly original (and Max von Sydow is wasted in brief scenes as Kane's father), but "Solomon Kane" is worthy of big-screen appreciation.</Review>
            <Review>Mr. Basset is too enamored of the usual action film clichés ... But he has a graphic visual style that suits the simplistic material and he keeps you watching even as the wet, sucking sounds of skewered flesh grows tedious.</Review>
            <Review>It's not everyone's cup of bloody tea, but an unapologetic genre treat for those willing to dive in.</Review>
            <Review>Formulaic, but it settles down into a fine if square-jawed groove, delivering rousing adventure of a sort which should generally please fans of throwback, morally black-and-white entertainment.</Review>
            <Review>Director Michael J. Bassett seems to know how to correctly handle the material, giving it a lightness of touch but also enough bloody and shocking spectacle to stir up viewers.</Review>
            <Review>Writer/director Michael J. Bassett stages the carnage under so much rain-soaked filth, you can almost smell the stench. It's a good stench.</Review>
            <Review>Uneven and far less deep that it believes itself to be, Solomon Kane is nevertheless a solid B-movie diversion that excels when sticking to its pulpy, action-fantasy roots.</Review>
            <Review>The script by director Michael J. Bassett wallows in formula and takes itself too seriously.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>Hill's eye for back alley scuzz is as strong as ever, but the story, adapted from a French graphic novel by Alexis Nolent, is so die-cut it gives neither him nor Stallone anything to work with.</Review>
            <Review>On its own degenerate terms, the movie works.</Review>
            <Review>It's a series of fight scenes that build to a climax that is surprisingly unsatisfying in the way it ultimately plays out.</Review>
            <Review>Sylvester Stallone shoots people in the face. That's it for subtext in this formula action swill. Why do I sound like I should expect more. Because the credits list the director as Walter Hill.</Review>
            <Review>Bullet to the Head doesn't try to adapt its star to 2013. It just pretends that we're still living in 1986. And for 91 minutes, it just about works.</Review>
            <Review>Stallone can still be entertaining, but here he's got no character to play, nothing fun to say, and the craziest hair/hairpiece/scalp growth this side of John Travolta.</Review>
            <Review>Bullet to the Head is an adrenaline-fueled, rip-roaring good time that asks little of audiences while still managing to fill their most basic filmgoing needs.</Review>
            <Review>Stallone's dead eyes are betrayed only occasionally by glimmers of humanity: when he spares a would-be victim who happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, or when he takes vengeance upon a particularly bad bad guy.</Review>
            <Review>A worthy callback to Stallone's glory days.</Review>
            <Review>The movie's titled Bullet to the Head, what the heck do you think it's going to be?</Review>
            <Review>It says "revenge never gets old." Yeah, but Sylvester Stallone did. Yikes.</Review>
            <Review>A big, dumb action film that charges forward believing Stallone is charismatic enough to sell even bad writing. He's not.</Review>

            <Review>Five years from now, will you want to watch this bloody $14 million extravaganza or Raimi's shoestring original, which was Amateur Hour elevated to pop art? Evil Dead just bleeds money.</Review>
            <Review>A stylish and worthy homage: inventive even as it is derivative, never quite jokey but never taking itself too seriously, and clocking in at an entirely appropriate 91 minutes. Any longer would be unmerciful; any shorter, ungenerous.</Review>
            <Review>Though it never channels the raw DIY energy of the original Evil Dead series -- what big-budget version could? -- this polished, clever remake remains true to the spirit of the original, which was at once viscerally terrifying and weirdly lighthearted.</Review>
            <Review>A gore fest that's just effective enough to whet fans' appetite for a sequel, even as it kills everyone else's appetite for dinner.</Review>
            <Review>This Evil Dead remake is more 'blah' than 'boo.'</Review>
            <Review>Alvares nails it. His Evil Dead has the fun spirit of the original (you need to have a very particular sense of the word fun, of course). His camerawork is inventive, occasionally beautiful.</Review>
            <Review>The current reboot feels uncreative. Watching the new film just made me miss Bruce Campbell's chin and shots of Raimi running insane through the woods.</Review>
            <Review>The screenplay is abysmal, the performances are lifeless, and Alvarez's direction does nothing but rip pages out of Raimi's playbook.</Review>
            <Review>It's gross and creepy and precisely the sort of horror movie your mother would probably hate.</Review>
            <Review>If you wondered what the "Evil Dead" movies might be like without the central wit and charisma of Bruce Campbell, the answer now awaits you.</Review>

            <Review>With a concept and influences consciously in mind; fine performances by Creed-Miles, Poulter, and Williams; and approving cameos...Fletcher is able to put his best foot forward in this creditable debut.</Review>
            <Review>There's a lot more to this likeable crime flick than your usual dunderheaded Danny Dyer vehicle.</Review>
            <Review>An unusually affecting movie, with pitch-perfect comic moments, a lot of heart, and a beautiful final shot that acts as a crowning achievement for Creed-Miles.</Review>
            <Review>Dexter Fletcher doesn't overplay the cowboy angle. Instead, he puts most of his efforts into creating a believable dynamic between the father and his sons, and it's in this tangled skein of shyness, suspicion, loyalty and love that the film's heart lies.</Review>
            <Review>[Fletcher] injects new marrow into some creaky bones.</Review>
            <Review>It wears its lion heart firmly on its sleeve with bouts of good humour and sense, making it impossible not to be drawn into its rugged charm.</Review>
            <Review>The direction by Dexter Fletcher to illicit the very strong performances by the juvenile actors, is a testament to his current strengths as a director</Review>
            <Review>Quote not available.</Review>

            <Review>Eckhart's cold blue eyes, sturdy, unsuspecting frame and his chiselled, pointy Doberman features stir a sense of murky mystery that fit the role particularly well and add extra juice to some rather overcooked scenes.</Review>

            <Review>So 66 years after Robinson became the first black major league baseball player, here we are with 42, which has been made with such reverence for Robinson's importance that Robinson is barely there.</Review>
            <Review>A square, uninventive, but detailed and stirring bio-pic devoted to the two years in an athlete's life that changed a nation.</Review>
            <Review>The Jackie Robinson story has always been more than deserving of a gaudy big-screen telling, and Helgeland is happy to oblige.</Review>
            <Review>A hero without imperfections can be problematic. But Jackie's nobility is more than well-earned, and tarnishing it for the sake of balance would be churlish. Besides, there's enough evil at loose among the white characters.</Review>
            <Review>Boseman gives a potentially star-making performance, while Ford, at 70, segues smoothly from firm-jawed action hero to elder-statesman character actor.</Review>
            <Review>It comes with a smooth burnished period look, and it tells a smooth and burnished story. Helgeland has good intentions but not much new to say about a real-life hero who wears his nobility and torment mostly as symbols.</Review>
            <Review>As a fond gesture to a country coming out of the dark ages, 42 is a good-hearted attempt at Robinson's story regardless of the historical realities it chose to gloss over.</Review>
            <Review>42 is a hackneyed, cookie-cutter film that manages to tell us absolutely nothing about a turning point in American history.</Review>

        <StoryLine>In 2008, as George W. Bush tried to gift the energy and mining industries thousands of acres of pristine Utah wilderness via a widely disputed federal auction, college student Tim DeChristopher decided to monkey-wrench the process. Bidding $1.7 million, he won 22,000 acres with no intention to drill. For this astonishing (and successful) act of civil disobedience he was sent to federal prison. Beth and George Gage's new documentary BIDDER 70 tells the story of this peaceful warrior whose patriotism and willingness to sacrifice have ignited the climate justice movement.

            <Review>Though viewers may already be aware of how DeChristopher's 2011 trial ended, the film maintains a gripping air of tension and mystery leading up to the verdict (he was sentenced to two years in federal prison for fraud but released after 21 months).</Review>
            <Review>As dully earnest, disorganized and self-righteous as an editorial in a student newspaper ...</Review>
            <Review>"Bidder 70," for all its clumsiness, nails the way that a spontaneous act of courage can focus the mind and clarify an ideology.</Review>
            <Review>Seems designed primarily for teach-ins and rallies.</Review>
            <Review>DeChristopher's ability to move with intellectual seriousness and a light heart between festivals and courtrooms complicates the popular idea of The Man and what his brand of power can achieve.</Review>
            <Review>Gripping documentary about a young man who risked a stiff prison sentence for doing something to stop global warming, a crisis that could lead to the deaths of 100 million people.</Review>
            <Review>Bidder 70 is modest but revitalizing.</Review>
            <Review>A powerful, empathetic portrait of a selfless, planetary patriot willing to sacrifice his liberty for the sake of Mother Earth's long-term prospects.</Review>
            <Review>Without being didactic, the documentary demonstrates how an ordinary concerned citizen can take a stand when politicians neglect to make decisions for the good of the people and instead serve the interests of big business.</Review>
            <Review>There are a lot of environmental documentaries out there about inciting change, but Bidder 70 is one of the most affecting.</Review>

        <StoryLine>THE END OF LOVE tells the story of struggling actor, Mark (played by writer/director Mark Webber), who is forced to grapple with his inability to grow up when the mother of his two-year-old son Isaac suddenly passes away. As he kindles a relationship with a young single mother (Shannyn Sossamon, 40 Days and 40 Nights), he begins to realize that he can no longer remain in denial about the real-life consequences his choices have on Isaac (played by Isaac Love, Webber's real-life son). The End of Love is an intimate and stunningly honest portrait of a young father in transition between the life he's been working for and the one that's waiting for him.(c) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>Creative people often mistakenly assume that the trials of their profession are compelling.</Review>
            <Review>"The End of Love" is an exceptionally intimate, human-scaled picture. It's also quite a special piece of work.</Review>
            <Review>Mr. Webber, a skilled actor, has not devised a narrative with sufficient momentum or tension to sustain much interest.</Review>
            <Review>There is plenty of evidence that Webber has something significant to say, and the gifts with which to express himself. Once he's ready to commit fully to his own vision, there's no end to what he might accomplish.</Review>
            <Review>Shot with tiny digital cameras to minimize the sense of intrusion, The End Of Love sometimes feels like a home movie, but that's also the source of its strength.</Review>
            <Review>Mark Webber's "The End of Love" connects and lingers by making incredible effort seem natural.</Review>
            <Review>Those willing to drift along with it will find a compelling character study about a man coming to terms with himself, his son, and the people who enter their lives.</Review>
            <Review>Single dad's struggles are poignant, somewhat mature.</Review>
            <Review>Webber appears to be making an audition tape with his second directorial effort, using screen time to display a range of moods and dramatic encounters that could go on to secure future jobs for the actor.</Review>
            <Review>Not sure if The End of Love's Mark Webber got that callback from Paul Thomas Anderson, but the Mark Webber who made The End of Love deserves to be getting a few.</Review>
            <Review>There are some lovely and moving things here, but over the long haul it's more like watching an hour and a half of someone's weekend trip to Knott's Berry Farm.</Review>
            <Review>It's the kind of indie in which shrugging naturalism means nobody has a distinctive personality or energy, and the claustrophobic sense of young Industry workers collarbone-deep into their own navels is hard to shake.</Review>

        <StoryLine>You can find them deep in the jungles of Borneo, in the hills of Umbria and perhaps even in your own backyard. They are fruit hunters, the subjects of the dizzying new film from acclaimed director Yung Chang (Up the Yangtze, China Heavyweight). THE FRUIT HUNTERS travels across culture, history and geography to show how intertwined we are with the fruits we eat. The ranks of the fruit-obsessed include adventurers, scientists, fruit detectives and even movie star Bill Pullman, fruit hunters dedicating themselves to searching for and saving rare and exotic fruit, and to creating a Garden of Eden in a world increasingly dominated by industrialized monoculture. A cinematic odyssey through nature and commerce, THE FRUIT HUNTERS will change not only the way we look at what we eat but how we view our relationship to the natural world. (c) Cinedigm</StoryLine>

Somewhere in between the introvert plagued with lifelong depression and the 60-something extrovert who still performs 80 to 100 high energy concerts a year, lies the real Rick Springfield. A fascinating look at a singular, multi-generational celebrity culture, An Affair of the Heart is a soulful examination of contrasting individual connections revealed through common universal threads of humanity. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>Whether trodding the boards for paying audiences or performing at the kitchen table for her theatrical family (mother Diane Salinger, father Jack Heller, uncle David Proval, boarder Harriet Schock) the only place Pandora Isaacs (Tanna Frederick) has ever felt truly safe and entirely at home is onstage. Like so many actors she is not completely sure about the difference between real life and the theater and - as she willingly admits - she really doesn't want to. Stinging from a recent romantic break-up, she retreats to the safety of her parents' ramshackle upstate country house - just 45 minutes from Broadway- where her non-theatrical sister (Julie Davis) and her sister's non-Jewish fiance (Judd Nelson) are also arriving for the weekend and the family's yearly Passover Seder, which is presided over by another uncle (Michael Emil). Family secrets, sibling rivalries and the possibility of true love as rare as a blue bullfrog all emerge, but at what cost?</StoryLine>

            <Review>Though Jaglom intends for us to be charmed by show folk, the amateurish performances and perennially misjudged direction wind up portraying them instead as boundlessly needy narcissists.</Review>

            <Review>Self-consciously cribbing from Chekhov by way of Robert Altman, the filmmaker convenes an extended family of stage actors at a decaying country house in New Rochelle, where the Ambien-enhanced emotional pitch lingers north of perpetual hysteria.</Review>
            <Review>Self-indulgent drama in which braying actors spout utter twaddle about the Thea-tah.</Review>
            <Review>Henry Jaglom applies what must by now qualify as a tradition of pointless agitation to the disruption of theater. Unsurprisingly, the results are disastrous.</Review>

            <Review>At the heart of the problem with this movie are matters of logic and cogency.</Review>
            <Review>The many strands of this amiable yet overstuffed romantic comedy don't hang together, though each, on its own, has a modest charm.</Review>
            <Review>What is most distressing about Admission is that it serves as further evidence that Tina Fey, despite her dominance of the small screen, has not yet mastered the big one.</Review>
            <Review>This is certainly an interesting idea, though the movie is badly handicapped by Fey, who must venture beyond her usual snippiness into scenes of genuine poignancy and proves unequal to the task.</Review>
            <Review>Granted, this is not automatic laugh-riot material, nor should it be, but didn't Fey recognize how hackneyed it all is?</Review>
            <Review>If Fey ends up making movies as good as this one over the next few years, television's loss will have been cinema's gain, for real.</Review>
            <Review>It is neither a broad comedy nor a dopey rom-com; it's actually, surprisingly enough, a seriocomic drama in something resembling the Alexander Payne mold, a slightly eccentric examination of flawed people doing their very best.</Review>
            <Review>Photographed in fifty shades of beige, Admission is the blandest film I've seen in months.</Review>
            <Review>A romantic dramedy about a passionate erudite oddball woman with her own life? Hooray!</Review>
            <Review>What's a romantic comedy to do when it is neither romantic nor comedic? When that film is Admission, it plunges forward drunkenly, hoping to overcome its inadequacies with goodwill created by the cast.</Review>
            <Review>Overstays its welcome before petering out unremarkably.</Review>
            <Review>An engaging cast holds our interest even when this rom-com meanders down unnecessary sideroads and dips into corny sentimentality.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>The movie is too calculated to shock. Korine just wants to be the danger he's warning us about.</Review>
            <Review>A trippy, florescent whirl of boobs and bongs.</Review>
            <Review>It's campy and comic at times, but Korine also gives the film a downbeat, melancholic edge, with voiceovers, pointed repetition of dialogue and images, and hallucinatory camera work, sound and editing.</Review>
            <Review>Neon bright and all raw energy, Spring Breakers is a pulsating paradox of a movie, both a tangerine dream and a cultural reality check, a pop artifact that simultaneously exploits and explores the shallowness of pop artifacts.</Review>
            <Review>Korine's story is a searing indictment of today's hedonistic, nihilistic youth, and his script is loaded with sharp, telling dialogue that exposes the rotten moral cores of its characters.</Review>
            <Review>The film stands, overall, as one of the director's richer provocations ...</Review>
            <Review>Spring Breakers is titillating and absurd and vulgar and, perhaps most importantly, entertaining.</Review>
            <Review>This strange film by Harmonie Korine will enrage and baffle many. But as a cinematic experience I included it among my top five films when it first came out last year this is a long, mad, fevered reverie that sucks you in and showers you with acid vomit.</Review>
            <Review>Behind the film's vacuous candy-colored outer shell are ambiguous and morally challenging concepts.</Review>
            <Review>For moviegoers looking for sensory overload, this will play particularly well.</Review>
            <Review>Actual spring breakers will probably loathe the movie; it's really for the pale art majors who never went.</Review>
            <Review>The most extraordinary thing about Korine's direction is how he gradually shifts the position of the viewer from self-possessed outsider looking in to complete immersion during a denouement where there is no one worth rooting for.</Review>

            <Review>This is pretty silly stuff, Twi-lite if you will, but played with maximum solemnity, no discernible humor and minimal excitement.</Review>
            <Review>[A] bizarre Saturday Night Live sketch about a girl with a bratty alien inside her.</Review>
            <Review>The Host isn't very good as a romance. There's not very much passion on screen, which makes the film a poor cousin to Twilight.</Review>
            <Review>The movie's structure is awkward. There's no real narrative thrust.</Review>
            <Review>The Host's infelicities-drab dialogue, ridiculous plotting, more emotional crises than there is story-are enlivened by its thematic eccentricities.</Review>
            <Review>Fear and dread of "the other" have long ruled American science fiction, fantasy, suspense thrillers and politics... How jarring then, and refreshing, to see The Host... take the invaders' point of view.</Review>
            <Review>Kind of like watching a toddler assemble a high-end bookcase.</Review>
            <Review>Those who found Twilight nauseating will find The Host has the same overlong runtime, cornball characters, and artificially pumped up romantic stakes.</Review>
            <Review>The Host fails as a romance, but it also struggles as an adventure film. The body-snatching angle has been done before, and the aliens... aren't menacing enough.</Review>

        <Duration>109</Duration>
        <StoryLine>In prewar Vienna, Victor Kaufmann (Moritz Bleibtreu/Soul Kitchen, The Baader-Meinhof Complex, Run Lola Run) and Rudi Smekal (Georg Friedrich/ Import/Export, Klimt, The Piano Teacher) had been the closest of friends, ever since childhood. But with Austria's annexation into the Third Reich, Rudi throws his lot in with the Nazis, hoping to gain a leg up by denouncing his Jewish friend and confiscating a Michelangelo sketch owned by Victor's family. The Kaufmanns are sent to a camp-until the authorities discover they only managed to take a forgery, with the whereabouts of the genuine artwork known only to Victor. Determined to find the real Michelangelo, the Nazis bring Victor in for interrogation. But a stormy night and a partisan attack upend their plans, and Victor seizes an opportunity to turn the tables on his captors through a daring scheme of switched identities. (c) IFC</StoryLine>

            <Review>An awkward blend of anti-Semitic atrocities and identity-swapping absurdity, the World War II drama "My Best Enemy" struggles to find a convincing tone.</Review>
            <Review>The script relies on too many unlikely twists, but Bleibtreu manages to sell them all.</Review>
            <Review>A movie largely devoid of attitude or suspense.</Review>
            <Review>My Best Enemy bleeds suspense like a pin-pricked tire. It wants to be clever, but survivor tales bring with them too much muck.</Review>

            <Review>Neither the plot of this farfetched caper nor Murenberger's approach to it, do any kind of justice to what is still, whether some people like it or not, one of the most terrible episodes in human history.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>111</Duration>
        <StoryLine>SYNOPSIS: A bold exploration of the intrigue and perils of infidelity, Tyler Perry's Temptation: Confessions of a Marriage Counselor is a compelling love story that dives straight into the heart of obsessive passion. "It's about a woman who starts to get restless in her relationship and her choice to be with another man has a huge effect on the rest of her life," explains screenwriter/producer/director Tyler Perry. "She goes on a journey - in her career and in her marriage - and she ends up in a very different place than she expected." In a departure from his previous dramas, this explosive film finds Perry exploring the nature of desire - and just how powerful and dangerous a taste of the forbidden can be. "This is definitely one of the most provocative movies - sexually and otherwise - that I've made," says the director. "There are a lot of people who struggle in their relationships. They make bad choices about their marriages. They get divorced. And so many of them don't step out of their situation and really think about the consequences of what they're doing. This movie asks, 'Are you sure you want to do this?' It sends up a flag." (c) Lionsgate</StoryLine>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>Perry's movies have become so thematically grandiose, visually incoherent, and self-defensively bourgeois that the only way to receive them lately is as a cynic.</Review>
            <Review>Perry has some worthwhile filmic models-Temptation gestures at Woody Allen in its setup, and Douglas Sirk in its melodrama-but he isn't even in the same star cluster as those greats.</Review>
            <Review>Look, we know what's going to happen. The movie's called Temptation, okay? Yet we still have to sit through more than an hour of flirty glances and repetitive conversations between Judith and Harley until anything vaguely adulterous occurs.</Review>
            <Review>Tyler Perry's Temptation is an awful, awful film and while it is easy to mock and dismiss, it is also kind of a shame to behold.</Review>
            <Review>Limp pacing and countless shots of Washington's skyline plague the narrative.</Review>
            <Review>It isn't until Temptation grows flamboyantly bad in its final act that it rises to the level of good dumb fun in the trashy tradition of Perry's most entertainingly awful films.</Review>
            <Review>Opting to make an adult version scared straight instead of a thoughtful, provocative piece on marriage, Perry hopes to frighten couples to stay together with his latest drama.</Review>
            <Review>Straitlaced and sermonizing, this is a sluggish cautionary tale about deviating from righteous church teachings.</Review>
            <Review>Smollett-Bell, Gross, and Brandy work hard to bring an emotional authenticity to their characters and relationships--an authenticity that is ultimately negated by questionable choices in Perry's script and direction.</Review>
            <Review>beyond dumb</Review>
            <Review>Perry has now built a media empire from spinning his own wheels.</Review>

            <Review>"Boy" finds hope, and love, in the oddest corners.</Review>
            <Review>Waititi has reached into his past for a story that belongs to him alone.</Review>
            <Review>A film like this would have little chance without the right casting, and James Rolleston is so right as Boy, it's difficult to imagine anyone else.</Review>
            <Review>Boy is a charmer, a funny and affecting coming-of-age story rendered with heart, and with nuttiness.</Review>
            <Review>The momentum from the opening dissipates early and without a real engine pushing the movie foward, it begins to drag...the film is 87 minutes and feels like it's 2 hours.</Review>
            <Review>This is an upbeat, often hilarious, but never mawkish, celebration of love.</Review>
            <Review>It's one of those flicks that has more resonance than you may at first realize and a level of charm that few films contain.</Review>
            <Review>Rolleston's winning presence doubtless has much to do with the fact that Boy is a record-breaking hit in its home country, but there's some salt mixed in with the film's sugar.</Review>
            <Review>A performer and comedian before becoming a filmmaker, Waititi uses his comic sensibilities to keep Boy from becoming mawkish or clichéd. He has created a coming-of-age tale that is truly original.</Review>
            <Review>Waititi does a nice tonal juggling act, balancing eccentric characters, a 1980s setting, child-drawn animation and Maori-inflected restagings of Michael Jackson videos with the painful consequences of parental neglect.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>There is a powerful moment in [the film] when Diskin, head of the Shin Bet from 2005 to 2011, candidly remarks that for the Palestinians he is himself a terrorist. That is not relativism but realism, and the welcome sign of an empathetic imagination.</Review>
            <Review>The film and its talking head participants paint the picture in both broad strokes and fine detail.</Review>
            <Review>Whatever one's political stripe regarding Israel, it's hard to dispute the impressions and perspective of the film's six eyewitnesses.</Review>
            <Review>The level of candor here may not satisfy hard-liners of either stripe, but it can help viewers begin to formulate new questions about the philosophical, strategic and moral challenges of conflict, in particular "wars on terror."</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately the movie feels evasive, and its flashy, digitally animated re-creations of military surveillance footage unpleasantly evoke the Call of Duty video games.</Review>
            <Review>It offers startlingly honest insight into the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from some of those who called the shots.</Review>
            <Review>The history is fascinating enough to overcome the film's intrusive digital transitions.</Review>
            <Review>Anyone with a serious interest in Israel should see the extraordinary new documentary The Gatekeepers.</Review>
            <Review>The film bravely pulls focus on Israel's behaviour as an occupying power, the treatment of the Palestinians and joins the growing list of recent films that cast a critical eye over a subject that was once deemed too thorny to question.</Review>
            <Review>This is unprecedented stuff right here, on a topic so volatile it feels like it's just waiting to explode. And as a film, it's effective - for the most part.</Review>
            <Review>Dror Moreh's documentary is remarkable not for stylistic innovation but for the very fact it exists.</Review>
            <Review>The film is detailed and requires concentration, especially for those who need to read the subtitles. But the effort is worth it for anyone vaguely interested in the subject. And of course the subject goes to the heart of the human condition</Review>

            <Review>Suppose Armand Assante had played the mother, not as a father, as a mother. Suppose Isabelle Huppert had taken the Colin Farrell part. This may be no more than playful, but heaven knows Dead Man Down needs as much of that as it can get.</Review>
            <Review>A way-too-leisurely thriller whose destination is fairly obvious from early on, but to which the talented cast apply themselves with effortful seriousness.</Review>
            <Review>Explores a common ground for noir thrillers before stumbling and imploding in a climax that feels like it might have been hijacked from an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie.</Review>
            <Review>While a mob thriller can be as nasty as it likes, what it can't be is silly.</Review>
            <Review>More a dark fairy tale about vengeance than the action-packed crime thriller it purports to be, the film is at times exhilarating, bold, and beautiful -- when it's not busy being ludicrous, fragmented, and just plain stupid.</Review>
            <Review>It takes forever to get going, unspooling its hopelessly convoluted, unwieldy plot for so long that it loses whatever marginal narrative momentum it possesses.</Review>
            <Review>An innocuous, unappealing and in the end an absurdly violent revenge gangster film.</Review>
            <Review>Not all of it hits its mark, but when the picture starts to gain momentum at the hour mark, its distinctiveness sets in. And it's almost startling.</Review>
            <Review>The cast does all that they can, but, by the end, Dead Man Down plays as a confused, noble misfire.</Review>
            <Review>It gives us no real themes to marinate upon, yet it gives us very little memorable action in which to revel. It's simply a mish-mosh and a shame.</Review>
            <Review>The plot and characters of pulpy revenge thriller Dead Man Down are pure B-movie stuff, yet stars Colin Farrell and Noomi Rapace lend the film unexpected class and conviction.</Review>
            <Review>While Dead Man Down has a talented cast in Farrell, Rapace, and Howard, it ends up being a rather bland take on the revenge thriller, offering nothing new or stimulating to the genre.</Review>

        <Title>Death by China</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2012</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>79</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Death by China pointedly confronts the most urgent problem facing America today - its increasingly destructive economic trade relationship with a rapidly rising China. Since China began flooding U.S. markets with illegally subsidized products in 2001, over 50,000 American factories have disappeared, more than 25 million Americans can't find a decent job, and America now owes more than 3 trillion dollars to the world's largest totalitarian nation. Through compelling interviews with voices across the political spectrum, Death by China exposes that the U.S.-China relationship is broken and must be fixed if the world is going to be a place of peace and prosperity. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>It sure makes you want to buy American. Assuming you can find anything American to buy.</Review>
            <Review>It would make a nice TV infomercial, but certainly doesn't deserve a big-screen release.</Review>
            <Review>It is ... unabashedly one-sided and is short on solutions, other than the usual "Call your Congressional representatives."</Review>
            <Review>[A] rabid piece of agitprop, which swamps a number of legitimate arguments against the current trade arrangement between the U.S. and China with the strident brushstrokes of a bad editorial cartoon.</Review>
            <Review>One need not fully subscribe to Peter Navarro's demonization to appreciate his lucid wake-up call to the imminent dangers of the huge U.S.-China trade imbalance and its disastrous impact on the American economy.</Review>
            <Review>Doc offers plenty of good reasons to worry about China, but is astonishingly heavy-handed.</Review>
            <Review>Manic and scattershot, Death by China is too overheated to impart its case with surgical precision. It feels, by God, but also overwhelms. Ergo, barely a recommendation.</Review>
            <Review>...unabashed agitative propaganda in the style of Michael Moore. It's selective in its facts, and it doesn't really engage its putative audience as adults, opting instead for cutesy graphics.</Review>
            <Review>Angry, fatally biased but watchable documentary ranting at China for its transgressions and damage done to the U.S. economy cries out for second opinions from other corners besides those damning.</Review>
            <Review>Further confirmation that agitprop documentaries have become wedded to a template that undermines their very arguments.</Review>
            <Review>As a wake-up call... Navarro scores points.</Review>
            <Review>The bulk of the film contains as much hysterical rhetoric as sober analysis.</Review>

            <Review>Bhalla builds a damning picture of what's happening to Wallace. But he avoids pure rant ...</Review>
            <Review>Although this documentary has a powerful political subtext, it is best described as a conceptual art piece about confinement, attached to a dual biography of the artist and the prisoner.</Review>
            <Review>The contrasting demeanors of its two main characters give Herman's House its spark, but the movie has some pungent moments without them.</Review>
            <Review>This moving but sketchy documentary fails to explore its provocative issues in fully satisfying fashion.</Review>
            <Review>It's an absorbing, prickly tale, which Bhalla doesn't tell as coherently as he could have-oddly fitting, considering this is a story about frustrated ambitions and unfulfilled potential.</Review>
            <Review>Against the prospect of unhappy endings, the human spirit still strives.</Review>
            <Review>A very poignant doc that celebrates the genuine virtues of compassion, friendship.</Review>
            <Review>Reminiscent in some ways of the Damien Nichols story but more about a father-daughter relationship. It also shows what a gifted conceptual artist can do, making the Whitney Biennial look like a bit of a joke.</Review>
            <Review>A compelling and enlightening documentary about the important role creativity can play in the pursuit of justice and the spread of compassion.</Review>
            <Review>An involving documentary that doesn't offer a convincing argument against solitary confinement for those who may not fully realize what's objectionable about it.</Review>
            <Review>Herman's House shows off the talents of several young principal crew members, and that of the director who makes his documentary feature debut, but it lacks the gravitas of human-rights filmmaking.</Review>
            <Review>A fascinating biopic as much about a possible miscarriage of justice as about a case of arrested development who looks like a little girl playing house with an imaginary mate.</Review>

            <Review>This suffers as well from the fact that the subjects' lives haven't changed all that much since 49 Up (2005); perhaps the series will improve yet as they head into old age.</Review>
            <Review>The original documentary was intended to illustrate how the country's deeply ingrained class system inscribed itself on the aspirations and inner lives of its young people. But the successive movies have been far less polemical.</Review>
            <Review>We're now at 56 Up,, and with each passing calendar leap, the experience of watching has only become more soul-stirring.</Review>
            <Review>Yes, on some level it's just a seven-year check-in with people maybe half-remembered, if that. Yet the films also serve as a kind of check-in with us, too.</Review>
            <Review>What ultimately is so compelling about 56 Up is the universality of the experiences. We were all once children. And we all will die. And in between, there is everything else.</Review>
            <Review>We feel good, refreshed and depressed in watching these people get older, also embarrassed in moments and cautioned about the passage of time.</Review>
            <Review>Perhaps predictably the mellowest of the movies. They for the most part seem to have settled into an autumnal contentment. The big conflicts have been largely resolved.</Review>
            <Review>As the project hits its half-century mark, with the "kids" settling into middle age, the signature cross-cutting between then, now and everything in between feels downright Proustian in its emotional depth.</Review>
            <Review>Apted, now 72, has said he'll keep calling on his subjects every seven years until he or they are dead. Whether the subjects show up or not, I for one will be in line when 63 Up comes around.</Review>
            <Review>a window into our shared human experience, and a terrific one at that.</Review>
            <Review>56 Up has become a stirring reflection, even tribute, to the little bends and turns of ordinariness, the ebbs and surges of everyday lives.</Review>
            <Review>Apted's subjects would object to the idea that we really know them, but we think we do -- and that's good enough to make his film feel like a reunion, a visit with an old friend. Or 14 of them.</Review>

On the road from Los Angeles to New York to Japan, the film captures the solitary life on tour: the exhilaration of performance, the wonder of newfound fame, the loneliness of separation from home and family.

            <Review>It's unfortunate that Riker's strong central character and evocative location work get undermined, at every turn, by a plot that not only springs zero surprises, but reduces the terror and loss of Cornish's charges to mere life lessons for her.</Review>
            <Review>The Girl enlightens with an unusual insight into the courage, durability and struggle of the Mexican people while taking the viewer on a guided tour of a piece of the country tourists never see.</Review>
            <Review>In all aspects, The Girl can't help it-this is headline-torn cinema du tearjerking at its most generic.</Review>
            <Review>Hernandez is soulful and affecting ... and Cornish embodies Ashley's self-centered character with nuance and subtlety.</Review>
            <Review>"The Girl" wants to be eat-your-vegetables cinema, but vegetables are good for you. This misery fest is more like an eat-your-bark movie.</Review>
            <Review>There are moving moments as Cornish channels the slow self-enlightenment necessary for Ashley's character arc. And the actress is particularly good in the scenes with the promising young Hernandez.</Review>
            <Review>A sentimental shift in the last reel of the film seems artificially designed to wrap up the story and demonstrate that a life lesson has been learned. It's when it's at its most contemplative that The Girl is at its best.</Review>
            <Review>[Cornish] plays Ashley with a mix of guilt and determination. And the precocious Hernandez brings an equally stubborn quality to Rosa.</Review>
            <Review>There's a heartfelt tenderness for this troubled character on Riker &amp; Cornish's part but it comes at the expense of realism or any serious answers to the questions raised by the film.</Review>
            <Review>The Girl is still more "good for you" than "good," but at least it supplements its feature-length lecture with a pair of good performances and a decent payoff.</Review>
            <Review>It's a spare film, but deeply felt and convincing, while bringing Cornish into a whole new light as an actress.</Review>
            <Review>Too limited in scope and too predictable to transcend its social-issue movie-of-the-week roots as a tearjerker designed to play on feelings of particularly maternal independent film fans.</Review>

        <StoryLine>A boy and his family adopt a runt of a dachshund from the local shelter and name her Shelly in honor of shelter dogs everywhere. Despite all odds, Shelly surprises the boy's father (Jason London, Jason and the Argonauts, Dazed and Confused) when she places in the state trials of Wienerschnitzel's illustrious Wiener Dog Nationals race. The family pools all of its resources to advance to the next round only to face strong opposition from the reigning champion, Princess, and her owner Ms. Merryweather (Morgan Fairchild, Fashion House, Flamingo Road). Meanwhile, judge Melanie (Alicia Witt, 88 Minutes, Two Weeks Notice) is banned from the race by the head judge (Bryan Batt, Funny People, AMC's Mad Men) when she tries to help the family prove that Ms. Merryweather is cheating. Relying only on her skill and her young owner's passion, little Shelly and her new family must face the challenge of advancing through the cutthroat world of the nation's greatest wiener dog race. One race. One nation. One wiener!</StoryLine>

        <Duration>110</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Why We Fight director Eugene Jarecki shifts his focus from the military industrial complex to the War on Drugs in this documentary exploring the risks that prohibition poses to freedom, and the tragedy of addicts being treated as criminals. In the four decades since the War on Drugs commenced, over 45 millions of addicts have been arrested - and for each one jailed, another family is destroyed. Meanwhile, the prisons in America are growing overcrowded with non-violent criminals, and illegal drugs are still being sold in schoolyards. By examining just where it all went wrong, Jarecki reveals that a solution is possible if we can just find it in ourselves to be compassionate, and see past the decades of paranoia and propaganda. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>Tells a complex story with troubling ease.</Review>
            <Review>The House I Live In is a work of journalism, not propaganda: Jarecki has done his research and leaves it to you to decide what to make of it.</Review>
            <Review>If [it] takes a while to focus, it eventually becomes the conversation starter the subject desperately needs.</Review>
            <Review>Jarecki takes a highly original approach to create a compelling, thought-provoking look at a highly relevant and controversial topic.</Review>
            <Review>Americans have long celebrated justice and freedom, but director Eugene Jarecki's The House I Live In forces viewers to look closely at political policies that have turned the nation into the No. 1 jailer in the world.</Review>
            <Review>Whatever your politics, you will find things to astonish and flabbergast and enrage you in what is perhaps the most cool-headed examination of America's relationship to illegal drugs ever.</Review>
            <Review>Somehow, Jarecki pulls it off, circling his subject and revisiting key themes as he constructs the convincing argument that, while the drug war may affect only a certain segment of the population, it's everyone's problem.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>99</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Venus and Serena takes an unfiltered look into the remarkable lives of the greatest sister-act professional tennis has ever seen. In a sport where they were not welcomed, the indomitable Williams sisters faced the opposition with grace and courage not only breaking new ground for female and African American athletes everywhere, but dominating the women's game for over a decade. The film tells the inspiring story of how these two women, against all odds, but with the help of visionary parents, made it to the top. Venus and Serena also explores the struggle of these two aging superstars during the 2011 tennis season as they battle life and career-threatening health problems. In Venus and Serena we gain unprecedented access into the sisters' lives - both in the spotlight and behind closed doors - and we watch as they draw their greatest strengths from one another to overcome countless adversities.

            <Review>An amiable enough overview, with the occasional 'say what?' moment.</Review>
            <Review>Does the film pull back the curtain on who they are and what drives them? Not so much.</Review>
            <Review>How much new does Venus and Serena have to tell us? Not enough.</Review>
            <Review>An engaging, warts-and-all look at the Williams sisters.</Review>
            <Review>The film works better as a thrilling but superficial celebration of two incredible athletes instead of a personal portrait of two world-famous women who continue to make sports history.</Review>
            <Review>Fans probably won't learn much they don't already know, but the film covers enough ground to feel like the movie equivalent of one of those lengthy, in-depth articles you used to get in the magazine of your Sunday newspaper.</Review>
            <Review>This documentary shows that the Williams sisters have always been judged by a different standard than everyone else, except in terms of wins and losses. It is the Williams family against the world, and they like it that way.</Review>
            <Review>They've made the sport more interesting, both as black athletes and as women...we left Venus and Serena inspired us to get out in the sun and get moving. And call our siblings.</Review>
            <Review>It doesn't quite get inside their heads, but it's brimming with vigour - rather like the girls themselves.</Review>
            <Review>They're perfect American drama queens. All that's missing is a last act.</Review>
            <Review>The sisters themselves reveal a little, mostly because of Serena's unguarded imperiousness; but as a study of sports supercelebrity it's a tad subdued.</Review>
            <Review>It might allow further appreciation of their accomplishments, but the one-sided approach too easily glosses over the more controversial aspects of their lives.</Review>

            <Review>This quietly affecting indie film, about a Middle East war vet and the 10-year-old boy he takes under his wing, gently pulls the heartstrings while making dramatic missteps along the way.</Review>
            <Review>The results are too predictable.</Review>
            <Review>Though both actors deliver performances more credible than the plot that frames them, their authenticity only highlights the script's affection for improbable coincidences and an ending even Garry Marshall might consider too pat.</Review>
            <Review>A film in which any authority figure who can't magically sober up and play surrogate daddy for a spell is treated as either a meddler or a well-meaning, do-nothing skeptic.</Review>
            <Review>The top notch production qualities, great direction, and fantastic ensemble performances make this film a definite recommendation.</Review>
            <Review>Excels in performances resonating with raw intensity and dramatic authenticity. But while earnestly inspired by the tragic circumstances facing US soldiers in war for real, the material forming the basis here is without historical context, and it shows.</Review>
            <Review>It all ends on a grace note that feels false but caps an otherwise solid if predictable drama.</Review>
            <Review>Earnestness combines with pedestrian technique in Martin Papazian's well-meaning but clumsy film.</Review>
            <Review>Papazian overloads the film with contrived melodrama and forced sentimentality.</Review>
            <Review>This entry in the returning-vet genre should probably have gone straight to the Lifetime channel.</Review>
            <Review>As a portrait of a self-pitying drunk's wet dream of inexplicable atonement, it's fairly effective, but as a story meant to take place on some rational version of planet Earth, it's utterly hopeless.</Review>

            <Review>The film tries to meld politically charged personal drama with the action-movie tropes you'd expect in a story set in the Middle East. (Chase through a crowded marketplace? Brawl at the hamam? Check!)</Review>
            <Review>The plot unfolds at a nice clip, but at no point does director Ruba Nadda evade expectations.</Review>
            <Review>One hopes "Inescapable" is only a momentary stumble for this promising filmmaker.</Review>
            <Review>A Canadian nonthriller that plays like a heavily sedated hybrid of "Taken" and "Not Without My Daughter" ...</Review>
            <Review>Inescapable is Nadda's first foray into thriller territory, and her inexperience shows in awkwardly mounted fight scenes and clumsy car chases, not to mention an almost fatally explanatory script.</Review>
            <Review>Muddled and inert despite the best intentions, this inescapably dull thriller plays like a Middle Eastern take on Liam Neeson's "Taken."</Review>
            <Review>Clearly meaning Inescapable as an act of love, Ms. Nada, a Canadian filmmaker with Syrian/Palestinian parents, has instead done a great disservice to her gene pool and our film-loving sensibilities. Irksome would be a more appropriate title.</Review>
            <Review>The movie suffers from the conflict between its potboiler instincts and the filmmaker's understandable need to acknowledge the brutality of Syria's secretive regime.</Review>
            <Review>Doesn't have the juice normally associated with such violent entertainment. Its interest in characterization is admirable, but there's little firepower where it counts the most.</Review>
            <Review>The movie could just as well be set in Islamabad, Nairobi or any city Westerners find threatening. (It was filmed, in fact, in Johannesburg.) It would look about right on a cable channel at 9 p.m.</Review>
            <Review>This international thriller-sparked by a nice, unexpected Marisa Tomei performance-starts off promisingly but trails off into cheap melodrama.</Review>
            <Review>Ruba Nadda's 2012 Toronto International Film Festival Gala Presentation is an okay actioner of the political mystery intrigue type.</Review>

            <Review>It is an expertly crafted thriller with a mastery of tension-building techniques.</Review>
            <Review>Thanks to the muddled plot motivations Tower Block really struggles in the final third.</Review>
            <Review>Gritty and claustrophobic, this British horror-thriller holds our interest with well-played characters rather than the wobbly plotting.</Review>
            <Review>Contains some effective jolts and engaging characters. But after setting up the premise, it doesn't really have anywhere to go. Kind of like the characters themselves</Review>
            <Review>The film is efficiently made and more realist than some of its ilk, in that the desperate inhabitants seem credible. What it lacks is directorial flair.</Review>
            <Review>The ending is a letdown but this is still a very promising debut from directors James Nunn and Ronnie Thompson.</Review>
            <Review>Tower Block doesn't rise high enough to match its ambitions.</Review>
            <Review>It's not a bad idea for a movie, but what we get is undercooked, with poor logic and even poorer pacing conspiring to prevent any much-needed tension to build.</Review>
            <Review>"Guilty pleasure" is pushing it, but you might develop a certain guilty appreciation for the way this slab of breezeblock Brit-schlock goes about its ludicrously contrived business.</Review>
            <Review>There are plenty of clichés, like lifts that don't work and a mysteriously disappearing phone signal. It's badly lit and rather grim, with far too many extreme close-ups.</Review>
            <Review>Entertaining, well written thriller enlivened by strong performances from a superb cast and a decent amount of shocks, though it's slightly let down by a disappointing finale.</Review>

            <Review>"Tai Chi Hero" merely fills the eye, offering little that stays with you.</Review>
            <Review>Purist fans of martial arts cinema probably won't embrace this film any more than its predecessor.</Review>
            <Review>This sequel is sluggish and rote where its predecessor was aggressively perky and desperate to please.</Review>
            <Review>The second installment of Hong Kong actor-director Stephen Fung's steampunk martial arts trilogy shows an encouraging restraint in its stylistic approach and finds a much sharper focus on its storytelling.</Review>
            <Review>Surprisingly heartbreaking at times, Tai Chi Hero adds some much needed depth to an already well-established and vividly distinguishable action franchise.</Review>
            <Review>The second installment in a planned martial-arts trilogy mixes broad comedy and cartoonish action that will appeal to the genre's fans, though crossover potential seems limited.</Review>
            <Review>Tai Chi Hero is a kung fu mashup, sticking steam-powered airplanes made of Victorian-age gewgaws and metal gears into one of those martial arts films where people float through the air without benefit of any flying machines at all.</Review>
            <Review>Like its predecessor, Tai Chi Hero is continually hampered by its thin characters and badly convoluted narrative but at least this time there are more opportunities to savour the many oddball pleasures.</Review>
            <Review>Stephen Fung's pop-up graphics and jazzy fight scenes feel part of an unwieldy mix in which the director just throws whatever half-baked conceits up on the screen he feels like.</Review>

        <StoryLine>After the death of her husband, Dr. Cara Harding's (Julianne Moore) faith in God has been shaken, but not her belief in science.

Cara quickly discovers that Adam's other personalities are murder victims and the more she finds out about him and his past, the closer she and her loved ones are to becoming murder victims themselves.

            <Review>Psychology-themed horror tale goes a little nutty in the end.</Review>
            <Review>Beginning as a psychiatric freak show, "6 Souls" eventually trades serial-killer intimations for backwoods bad mojo before becoming just another dimly lighted pop-up-stalker flick.</Review>
            <Review>A preposterous supernatural thriller that inexplicably managed to sign up Julianne Moore to star.</Review>
            <Review>"6 Souls" is regrettably sick with that familiar disease afflicting movies of this ilk: ostentatious, hollow moodiness that spreads like an unwelcome rash.</Review>
            <Review>What unholy spirit could have possessed Julianne Moore when she signed on for the sort of throwaway horror flick that would normally star unknowns and go straight to DVD?</Review>
            <Review>The end credits, which seem almost as long as the movie itself, dementedly thank everyone from the citizens of Pennsylvania to William Wyler, Howard Hawks and God. What an insult.</Review>
            <Review>A patchwork, conventional, and oft-told story that's a whole lot sillier than was probably intended.</Review>
            <Review>6 Souls is as boring as they come. It's a horror mystery with not a single second of suspense and a batch of uninteresting and naturally boring performances.</Review>
            <Review>Julianne Moore cashes in a small segment of her reputation in the starring role of this overwrought psychological thriller.</Review>
            <Review>If not for the presence of the extraordinary Moore, it wouldn't be worthy of any attention at all.</Review>
            <Review>A wretchedly unwatchable train wreck of a film that sorely misuses its talented cast.</Review>
            <Review>(T)here is a nice sense of dread here, a level of suspense that slowly dissipates as the movie meanders toward the exhausting end of its one hour and forty five minute run time.</Review>

            <Review>Conde knows that being in New York has given him the opportunity to make a life, but Govenar's slow pace doesn't quite do the story justice.</Review>

            <Review>Aurangzeb keeps you engaged as it reimagines the classic Bollywood trope of brothers on opposite sides of the law and the potential redemption of filial love. Sadly, cynicism and ambivalence are the modern components to this narrative.</Review>
            <Review>Dealing with many subplots, Sabharwal becomes oblivious he is diluting the intensity of the screenplay making it less enthralling for audiences.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>The heart of Hogan's film is in the right place, and Collette is masterful as an agent of anarchy.</Review>
            <Review>The scenery Down Under looks great and you certainly can't write off a film where Liev Schreiber plays a shark hunter.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director P.J. Hogan may have based "Mental" on an actual incident from his childhood, but the crazy quilt of a movie that resulted feels anything but real.</Review>
            <Review>"Mental" wildly overplays the kookiness and quirk.</Review>
            <Review>A lot of times, you simply want the jabbering characters to shut up.</Review>
            <Review>Mental skewers the easy-on and -off labels of psychiatry, but some sequences, particularly one of "bad dreams," are sophomoric.</Review>
            <Review>The humour is every bit as rude and raucous as before, but Hogan's touch here seems heavy handed and the use of songs from The Sound of Music doesn't work nearly so well as the joyous Abba tunes that drove Muriel's Wedding.</Review>
            <Review>There are some big laughs and fine performances, yet not enough realistic grounding in the characters or story to sustain its dramatic transition in the second half.</Review>
            <Review>Given the film's garrulous multitude of characters, one wishes they would all just shut up and sing.</Review>
            <Review>Enjoyable performances can't compensate for the film's lack of control: in Hogan's hands the broad humor sells out the sincerity, and when that mark is missed, we end up at twee.</Review>
            <Review>Not content to make his point through sharp-tongued comedy, Hogan ends up beating a dead horse -- or shark, as the case may be.</Review>
            <Review>Hilarious but a tonal bucking bronco, the effort is perhaps best reserved for viewers in the mood for a runaway mine cart viewing experience, willing to absorb all the chaos Hogan happily provides.</Review>

            <Review>This is a cleverly made, smartly written, totally satisfying armrest-gripper.</Review>
            <Review>Just when the movie has us in its grasp, the script falls to pieces and turns into a crass female-in-peril button-pusher.</Review>
            <Review>Crude as it is, The Call milks its jump scares and don't-go-down-to-the-basement tension for all they're worth. See it with a full house, if you absolutely must see it at all.</Review>
            <Review>Let's call The Call what it is: high quality trash that both diminishes and is redeemed by all the talents who have deigned to bring it to life.</Review>
            <Review>If you're going to watch a movie in which two people talk on the phone for most of the film, it's not the worst thing in the world for one of the folks involved to have the face of Storm from the X-Men.</Review>
            <Review>This is as brain-dead as a movie can be and it assumes the audience will have the I.Q. of a rutabaga.</Review>
            <Review>It's difficult to hold an audience pretty much alone for 70 minutes but [Halle Berry] does a much better job than the screenplay deserves.</Review>
            <Review>A surprisingly proficient thriller - even more proficient for the viewer who bails before the final scene.</Review>
            <Review>A simple but tense thriller told from the perspective of kidnap victim and 911-responder.</Review>
            <Review>It seems at odds with itself thanks to a generous helping of tropes from two distinctly different genres: fast-paced action thriller and creepy serial killer horror.</Review>
            <Review>Rides completely off the rails by the finale, and the film seems to completely embrace its stupidity...</Review>
            <Review>Halle Berry delivers an emphatic reminder of her star status in this tightly-plotted low-budget thriller.</Review>

            <Review>Foreboding images abound - crawling lizards, mysterious lights in the sky, a funereal assembly populated by grotesques - along with occasional ambient droning on the soundtrack and moments of mild humor and raw gore. Do the tableaus add up? Not really.</Review>

            <Review>Dermot Mulroney's 'Man with No Name' drifter is all too appropriately at the centre of offbeat auteur Calvin Reeder's 'Film with No Point', The Rambler.</Review>
            <Review>Sinister, comical, aggravating, and audacious, Calvin Lee Reeder's film is nothing short of an affront.</Review>
            <Review>Feels like a distant cousin to the new Maniac remake: horror stories told from inside the mind of a calm, cool lunatic.</Review>
            <Review>A mixture of unhinged brilliance, idiocy, unsettling confusion, and a whole lot of chaos.</Review>
            <Review>This surreal roadshow of weirdness charts a highway of American grotesquerie.</Review>
            <Review>Its intended jokes are mostly unfunny but as it develops, The Rambler contains enough hallucinatory imagery to boil over with a certain nightmarish feel.</Review>

            <Review>You don't have to be a fan of info-graphics in social-justice docs to be troubled by one showing that the price of processed food has decreased in almost exact proportion to the rise in cost of fresh fruits and vegetables.</Review>
            <Review>"A Place at the Table" presents a shameful truth that should leave viewers dismayed and angry: This nation has more than enough food for all its people, yet millions of them are hungry.</Review>
            <Review>One thing is clear from "A Place at the Table": You cannot answer the question "Why are people hungry?," without also asking "Why are people poor?"</Review>
            <Review>It specifically addresses our country's hunger crisis. But it also speaks to larger hungers. Hungers for independence, a dignified life, a better chance for ones children-in short, the American dream. See it and weep.</Review>

        <StoryLine>At the beginning of World War II a hostile chance encounter in the skies above the harsh Norwegian wilderness leaves two aircraft - one British, one German - shot down in a remote and isolated region. By strange coincidence the crews seek shelter in the same cabin. They must battle to survive the brutal winter in order to get back to the war - and to fighting one another. Although war has made them enemies, as the days go by animosity proves hard to maintain. Mutual need leads to unlikely friendships, and the rules of war must be put aside.

            <Review>The performances are more than adequate.</Review>

            <Review>The film remains mediocre, with flat cinematography and crudely anachronistic dialogue.</Review>
            <Review>A game effort by a decent cast highlights the old-fashioned submarine thriller "Phantom," but heavy-handed dialogue, flurries of melodrama and a silly ending make the whole enterprise sink like a stone.</Review>
            <Review>It's not something you want to plunk down $12 for, but just diverting enough to check out when it arrives on Netflix Instant.</Review>
            <Review>[Its] admirable air of realism dissipates once Robinson takes viewers outside the sub, where torpedo skirmishes are staged with too-perfect CGI bombast.</Review>
            <Review>"Phantom" has a pulpy B-movie intensity and economy to match its cast of quality character actors.</Review>
            <Review>When limited by budget, a good independent film turns in on itself and spotlights the actors, and that's where the meat is in this movie.</Review>
            <Review>Done well, submarine movies are intense affairs that keep viewers glued to the screen as characters play breathtaking games of cat-and-mouse. Done poorly, they turn out like Phantom.</Review>
            <Review>It's fun just to hear the lingo and watch the sailors go about their tasks, but not so fun when the captain's Dark Secret starts giving him cheesy, strobing flashbacks.</Review>

            <Review>Since every funny moment here involves cynicism, arrogance, heartlessness, and self-destruction, you never believe the movie when it's telling you how nice and contrite these characters are.</Review>
            <Review>The true comeback story in this fictional comeback story doesn't belong to a character named Burt Wonderstone, but to an actor named Jim Carrey.</Review>
            <Review>This comedy about a magician who must hit bottom before rising again to the wonder of his beloved craft pulls plenty of sweet moments and a slew of laughs out of a story that might have been thin air.</Review>
            <Review>This may be the kind of semi-bad, semi-inspired comedy that could not only stand repeated viewings but perhaps improve with them.</Review>
            <Review>A generic, fitfully funny mainstream comedy that doesn't nearly get the best from its name-brand players but doesn't qualify as a desecration, either.</Review>
            <Review>A veritable festival of bad toupees and repeated gags that just lie there, "The Incredible Burt Wonderstone'' runs a bit more than an hour and a half but seems much longer - like it had been edited down at the last minute.</Review>
            <Review>Refreshingly single-minded in its aim to entertain, Wonderstone has no social agenda, no artistic aspirations, no enduring lessons - other than, perhaps, the universality of lifelong friendship.</Review>
            <Review>Flawed, but its affability is undeniable.</Review>
            <Review>...a serious disappointment that squanders its setup and talented cast...</Review>
            <Review>A painfully tedious and unpleasant comedy completely void of any laughs.</Review>
            <Review>Don Scardino's The Incredible Burt Wonderstone is a middling and extremely dated comedy that only gets by because of Jim Carrey's over-the-top performance.</Review>
            <Review>A slow, humdrum comedy that would have worked better as a 10-minute sketch than a feature film.</Review>

            <Review>The chief problem here is that Frank is neither likable nor very bright. For the most part, you're thinking, go ahead, bust his kneecaps.</Review>
            <Review>Prieto does what he can to keep things roaring along, but the overall effect is not a lot more stimulating than your average diet cola.</Review>
            <Review>We're ... left to cheer someone simply because there's really no one else to root for.</Review>
            <Review>Pusher is some kind of tragedy, though not the one its filmmakers intended.</Review>
            <Review>Sniffing into the seams of England's multiculti capital, it's best at showing the grungy, hustling-and-bustling city as a place of slowly uncoiling despair. A hyper-charged, buzzy take on the London night-scene-and one man slipping under it, for no-good.</Review>
            <Review>Prieto treats the experience like a music video, with superfluous visual ornamentation getting in the way of gritty suspense. Pusher is a sound and light show that should have its power strip unplugged.</Review>
            <Review>Pusher has a neon-lit nervy energy -- at once slick and grungy -- and the sort of unabashed, screw-tightening rhythms that genre enthusiasts will embrace.</Review>
            <Review>The most original British gangster flick in years.</Review>
            <Review>Both the theme and the execution are formulaic, although Spanish director Luis Prieto shows some visual flair.</Review>
            <Review>Pusher is unnecessary for Refn fans that have followed his work from the beginning, but is more worthwhile for new viewers since they don't know what they're in for.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Filmmaker Paul Saltzman returns to Mississippi to confront the virulent racist who assaulted him in the mid-1960s, in the process sparking a thoughtful debate on the topic of intolerance and personal reconciliation at the dawn of the 21st Century. The American Civil Rights Movement was in full swing when Saltzman journeyed into the heart of Mississippi to help with voter registration in 1965, and some of the locals in this Old South stronghold were determined to maintain the status quo. One of those men was Byron "Delay" de la Beckwith, a proud member of the Ku Klux Klan whose father made headlines as the man convicted of killing Civil rights activist Medgar Evers. Shortly after arriving in Mississippi, Saltzman was attacked by a group of men led by de la Beckwith. The horror of that situation stuck with Saltzman for decades and now, over 50 years later, he sits down with his assailant to discuss the lingering specter of racism. Additional interviews with Harry Belafonte recount the turbulence of the voter drive that Saltzman took part in, and conversations with Mississippi native (and current resident) Morgan Freeman offer unique perspective on the prevalent attitudes of the locals, both past and present.</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>A typical British family is labeled as murderers by the tabloid press after a dinner guest dies in their home, and a scheming psychotherapist leaks the story to opportunistic reporters. Tom Thompson (Chris Langham) was taking his dog for a walk when he happened across Blake, a man who appeared to have fallen on hard times. Sympathetic, the suburban father invited the stranger back to his home or a hot meal. During the course of the dinner, however, Blake suddenly dropped dead. Months later, a friend of the family relays the perplexing story to his therapist Dr Eric Sacks (Simon Amstell), who immediately leaks the story to the press. In no time, the Thompsons gain a notorious reputation as the, "Family of Killers". Meanwhile, all Tom wants is to gain the respect of his rebellious daughters Jess and Katie, sooth the frazzled nerves of his distraught wife Sophie. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi</StoryLine>

But what starts as a simple job quickly sends their relationships-with their significant others and each other-reeling. Amidst trouble with his fianc�e (Sophia Takal, V/H/S), Nick finds himself falling for the film's flirtatious ing�nue (Arielle Kebbel, "90210"); Darryl, meanwhile, struggles to focus on his editing work in between fights with his tempestuous girlfriend (Melonie Diaz, Be Kind Rewind).

            <Review>Schechter made the whole thing for about $50,000, without any A-list names. And yet it's sharper and more entertaining than most of the movies to come out this month at 10 times the budget - or well beyond.</Review>

Through the eyes of Larry Sole, a First Nation teenager filled with bravado and angst, fragile and yet angry, seeking clarity clouded by confusion, seeking to belong without belonging, comes the story of three unlikely friends isolated in a small rural town discovering what they can of life and love amid racial tensions and the recklessness of youth, in a world clouded by a dark mystery from his past.</StoryLine>

            <Review>[Doron] has assembled a uniformly solid cast, starting with an impressive debut by Evans, whose brown eyes are both soulful and watchful. It's a performance that commands our attention and empathy.</Review>
            <Review>The emotions present in Anita Doron's film still feel fresh and universal, even if some of the dialogue is clunky.</Review>
            <Review>It's an undeniably noble effort from all involved, but the dreary denouement makes viewer feel lesser than blessed.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Deep in the heart of the unforgiving Australian desert lies Pine Gap, a top-secret government facility operated by the United States military. When the base comes under attack from unknown forces, an elite team is sent in to extract the military scientists. They encounter a beautiful young woman with no memory of how she came to be in the base, and find it overrun by disturbed patients from the base's medical sector. But as the squad delves deeper it becomes clear that there is something far more sinister - and far more dangerous - going on at Pine Gap. A taut thriller that recalls the best classic sci-fi action films, Crawlspace is the feature debut of Justin Dix - an award winning special effects supervisor who has worked with George Lucas and Roger Donaldson.

        <StoryLine>Another woman has gone missing on the hottest day of the year. The death toll rises with the temperature, and while everyone else is staying in, Albert Mullin is out, prowling the streets and alleyways. But the end is near and Albert knows it. He says he's always known. Front Porch Productions Films presents "PLASTIC," a new feature film. Written and director Jose Carlos Gomez, and produced by Laura Locascio. Plastic is a story of what transpires during the course of a single day when, Albert Mullin finds himself hunted down by his own ravaging demons. His house, a dumping ground of horrors, is no longer the safe haven he thought it was, and his new victim, Sarah Wilson, may be his last. But while she lies tied up in Albert's house, the outside world spins its own web of deceit. Parole officer Michael Harris is too busy negotiating himself out of his own extramarital affairs to see through Albert's dark secrets. Darryl, Albert's neighbor, cries wolf at every turn and no one pays attention anymore, when, perhaps, this time they should. All have a small part to play on this, the hottest, deadliest day of the summer.</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>Young adults at a first-time offenders' boot camp discover the legend of the giant lumberjack Paul Bunyan is real, but is much more horrifying than they could have imagined. Starring B-Movie legends Joe Estevez and Dan Haggerty (TV's Grizzly Adams), along with many familiar and fresh faces, Axe Giant: The Wrath of Paul Bunyan will make audiences cower in fear. Paul Bunyan is one of the most famous characters in North American folklore. He and his companion, "Babe the Blue Ox," are featured in tall tales of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Bunyan was a lumberjack of great size and skill, rumored to be so tall that "his footsteps created the Great Lakes. He "dragged his axe and made the Grand Canyon." Today, Bunyan's legend is commemorated by numerous statues across the upper Midwest and far-beyond. (c) Cinema Purgatorio</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>Andy Kaufman, often erroneously cited as a comedian, was the world's first performance artist. He defied genre and categorization to become a true artistic pioneer. Given the absence of separation between his life and his performances, news of his terminal illness in 1984 was treated by many as another of his practical jokes. Then, upon his death from lung cancer months later, the questions and incredulity continued. Now, over twenty years later, his death is still not considered to be an undisputed reality. Many continue to wonder if Andy is alive... and if he is, what is he doing? What does he look like? Will he return to the spotlight? These are the questions explored in depth by this documentary, The Death of Andy Kaufman. --&amp;copy; Official Site</StoryLine>

        <Title>Safety Last!</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 1923</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>80</Duration>
        <StoryLine>After Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, the silent film era's "third genius" was Harold Lloyd, who stars in this Horatio Alger-style story of an average country boy trying to make good in the big city. The Boy (Lloyd) leaves his sweetheart, The Girl (Mildred Davis, later the real-life Mrs. Lloyd) in Great Bend while he pursues his fortune in a teeming metropolis. The Boy lands a job as a clerk at a fabric counter of DeVore's, a huge department store, but he lies in his letters home to his beloved, pretending to be the store's manager and spending his earnings on lavish gifts. The Boy's roommate, The Pal (Bill Strother) makes money as a "human fly," performing attention-getting stunts. Promised $1,000 by DeVore's real manager if he can devise a publicity gimmick, The Boy convinces his friend to climb the 12-story establishment and split the winnings with him. On the day of the event, however, The Pal is busy dodging The Law (Noah Young), forcing The Boy to make the arduous climb solo. Dodging a variety of obstacles, The Boy climbs higher and higher, eventually dangling from the store's clock tower, in the film's most memorable image. ~ Karl Williams, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>This Harold Lloyd high-class low comedy has thrills as well as guffaws.</Review>
            <Review>The clock-hanging climax that caps this generally charming tale of a country boy out to make his fortune in the big city is a superb example of his ability to mix suspense and slapstick.</Review>
            <Review>The Glasses character in Safety Last would have blended with the background of the department store where he worked if it had not been for action imposed upon him. But what action!</Review>
            <Review>The other great silent comics defined their own worlds; Lloyd lives dangerously in ours.</Review>
            <Review>... the most famous of Harold Lloyd's silent comedies and first of his "thrill pictures," films that he built around slapstick ingenuity in the midst of daredevil stunts. This one has a doozy...</Review>
            <Review>...one of Lloyd's best films, combining a touching romantic plot with some amazing stunt work.</Review>
            <Review>The climb itself is a masterful feat of physical acting and comic timing, surpassed only by the best works of Chaplin and Keaton.</Review>
            <Review>... a briskly paced thrill comedy with memorable gag after memorable gag, and a surprising dark streak.</Review>
            <Review>You'll believe a man can die.</Review>
            <Review>The climb has both comic and dramatic weight because it is both a thrilling exercise in physical humor and a thematically rich evocation of the pressures men feel to succeed, lest they be viewed as less than a man</Review>
            <Review>Of the great silent film comedians, Harold Lloyd stood apart from Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton by virtue of his everyman approach to physical comedy. He had to work at it and he let his difficulty show, but not entirely.</Review>
            <Review>As a personality, Lloyd is a combination of silly and sweet, but his true star power comes from his daring athleticism.</Review>

            <Review>An offbeat and entertaining ensemble piece that disappointingly ends on a lukewarm note.</Review>
            <Review>I don't think it's a film that aims very high and it sort of achieves what it aims to do, I think. I found it perfectly amiable.</Review>
            <Review>The improbabilities and sheer banality of Christine Bartlett's screenplay are almost overcome by the quality of the cast, but not quite.</Review>
            <Review>The Wedding Party may well have been a better film if the underdone premise of the fake wedding had been done away with altogether, because the movie is more interesting when it picks at the foibles and fears that gather around these couples.</Review>
            <Review>All is well if you accept as plausible the central premise of the screenplay ... For me ... is just too far fetche</Review>
            <Review>By injecting a comical twist into a serious subject matter, a variety of issues and illusions are canvassed. As a result, the journey we take is a complicated and enjoyable one</Review>

            <Review>Soon enough the worlds of Up Top and Down Below feel like distractions, CGI Potemkin villages.</Review>
            <Review>A Romeo and Juliet story for the age of CGI overkill, Upside Down zigs where it should zag and dulls where it should dazzle.</Review>
            <Review>Absent any emotional grounding, the film is a gorgeous, sterile construction, like a dream city unoccupied by humans.</Review>
            <Review>Simply put, this is one of the craziest films to come along in a while and I can confidently say that anyone who sees it will either hail it is some kind of crackpot masterpiece or dismiss it as one of the silliest damn things they've ever seen.</Review>
            <Review>It doesn't really develop its story, or its themes. It doesn't truly draw out its characters. It evokes no serious emotions. It has - in the end - no gravity.</Review>
            <Review>"Upside Down" is such a gorgeous wreck that I could almost sense Terry Gilliam somewhere muttering, "Wait a minute, I should have been the one to screw up this idea."</Review>
            <Review>An otherworldly framework in which the rules exist to separate the classes until Romeo &amp; Juliet come along to break them with the gravity of romance. If only.</Review>
            <Review>The problem is that the physics here are patently ridiculous, and there is likewise no viable chemistry between stars Jim Sturgess and Kirsten Dunst.</Review>
            <Review>Upside Down is an interesting mess - coming across mostly as a visual disaster with big dreams and aspirations that never quite pan out.</Review>
            <Review>A movie that will surely wow audiences with its awesome visuals but floor them with its terrible storytelling.</Review>
            <Review>Dunst, a veteran of the famous upside-down Spider-Man kiss, may be used to this, but viewers of the fantasy romance Upside Down may have the dizzy feeling of blood rushing to their heads. What is going on here and, furthermore, why?</Review>
            <Review>There is little consistency. As a creator, you cannot tell us one thing and have characters do another without consequence. Upside Down is plagued with those problems, at least in small ways. It is frustrating for the viewer.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Filmmakers Jodi Wille and Maria Demopoulos probe the inner-workings of a Utopian community that thrived in California during the early 1970s in this documentary based on Isis and Electricity Aquarian's book The Source: The Untold Story of Father Yod, Ya Ho Wa 13, and The Source Family. Under the guidance of spiritual guru Father Yod, the secretive Source Family operated a popular vegetarian restaurant on the Sunset Strip, and started a psychedelic rock band while living in a sprawling estate in the Hollywood Hills. With a steady influx of celebrities helping the restaurant to thrive, Father Yod's family began to expand, and gain greater influence. But when Father Yod clashed with the local authorities, it was time to move on. Selling the restaurant and moving the commune to Hawaii seemed like the perfect solution, but it was this decision that would lead to tragedy just one year later.</StoryLine>

            <Review>The film's scant plot plays second fiddle to Hoffman and Harwood's nuanced exploration of love so long unrequited.</Review>
            <Review>Dustin Hoffman's directing debut about retired musicians in the third act of their lives has a winning, classy charm for older audiences.</Review>
            <Review>The first thing to note is that Hoffman has apparently had a grand time working with these professionals, all of whom as residents of the home are splendid.</Review>
            <Review>"Quartet" is one of those movies that looks so effortless, it's easy to forget just how much could have gone wrong.</Review>
            <Review>'Quartet" is a lovely little charm bracelet of a film, a fairy tale for the geriatric set blessed with a wonderful cast and a carry-on attitude.</Review>
            <Review>Hoffman, in his directorial debut, has crafted a hopeful movie with a warm atmosphere, but one that's realistic, too.</Review>
            <Review>More lethargically paced than even the slowest of its geriatric characters, the movie creeps along with all the dull, inoffensive inevitability of old age.</Review>
            <Review>Will she, or won't she, join the others on stage in a quartet rendition of Verdi? Not to worry: it all unravels splendidly in this teeth-in-a-glass comedic drama.</Review>
            <Review>While Hoffman seems very aware he's gently closing the book on an entire generation of entertainers, he nonetheless allows them to do what they've always done best: be entertaining.</Review>
            <Review>If this film is any indication of {Hoffman] creative capacity as a director, one can only hope that he will pursue his third act with as much vigor as his first.</Review>
            <Review>Beyond the Masterpiece Theatre set design there lies a cunning tribute to the easy command of experienced actors and to the art that brought them there.</Review>

        <Duration>101</Duration>
        <StoryLine>The Brass Teapot is a modern fable about money and the meaning of the American dream. Based on the comic book, The Brass Teapot is a feature film about John (Michael Angarano) and Alice (Juno Temple), who live in small down America. They are in their 20's, married, very much in love and broke. Once voted "Most Likely to Succeed," Alice struggles to make ends meet while her friends enjoy the good life. Her husband John, neurotic and riddled with phobias, just wants to get the bills paid. But an accident leads them to a roadside antique shop where Alice is spontaneously drawn to a mysterious brass teapot. It isn't long before they realize that this is no ordinary teapot and that perhaps they have found the answer to all of their financial woes. The Brass Teapot is a magical comedy that reminds us to be careful what we wish for. (c) Magnolia</StoryLine>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>A comic fable that squanders its twisted-fairy-tale concept.</Review>
            <Review>Temple and Angarano, entertaining enough, never quite sell the idea that this goodhearted couple would be so easily transformed by greed.</Review>
            <Review>Without a human dimension to ground its construct, "The Brass Teapot" ultimately feels like an interminably stretched-out skit rather than a storybook lesson stained with blood and hurt.</Review>
            <Review>Ms. Mosley, who directed from a screenplay by Tim Macy, struggles to fill her debut feature with a slender notion, but the premise defeats her, even if the story operates at the outset on the pleasure principle.</Review>
            <Review>The Brass Teapot too often devolves into stale slapstick ...</Review>
            <Review>There's not much depth to Mosley's debut, which is based on a short story by Tim Macy. But Michael Angarano and Juno Temple are an appealing pair as John and Alice, struggling suburbanites.</Review>
            <Review>... it is apparent that Ramaa Mosley has a voice, and that The Brass Teapot is a focused, controlled piece of storytelling that displays real control.</Review>
            <Review>What matters is how the device is used to push the characters, and The Brass Teapot does that beautifully. Since there is an unlimited source of income, Alice's imagination is really the only limit to how abusive she and John can be.</Review>
            <Review>I'm left wondering: Doesn't a teapot have better things to do than force its demonic will on others, including an innocent, naive couple? Actually, I'm not wondering about that at all. I prefer coffee.</Review>
            <Review>The heart of the film is in the right place and is a fun addition to the fantasy film genre.</Review>
            <Review>The energetic lead performances bring some smiles for fans of Angarano and Temple. The story is less successful though as aside from its unique premise it has very little to offer thanks to its very familiar moral.</Review>
            <Review>Juno Temple and Michael Angarano are appealing, and director Ramaa Mosley keeps her dark comedy brightly paced.</Review>

            <Review>It's too safe, too knotty, too wastefully handsome, too dull.</Review>
            <Review>Stoker trembles between the portentous and the ridiculous, and I think you know which one is going to win. The audience does make its decision: They've been had yet again.</Review>
            <Review>Stoker is a movie about tension and inaction, about people trying to figure out what's going on in someone else's head.</Review>
            <Review>Stoker is a cunning exercise in transgression. But one can't help but wonder what kind of film Park might have made if he'd had the full creative control to which he's accustomed in Korea.</Review>
            <Review>None of it is life-changing, but it is effectively eerie. Stylishly spooky, even.</Review>
            <Review>"Stoker" plays out like a Kabuki "Macbeth": gallons of style slathered on a story you already know by heart.</Review>
            <Review>Park's latest feature and first English-language release is a stylish, brutal, oft-uncomfortable tale of mystery and revenge.</Review>
            <Review>There is a freedom to his filmmaking; he's trying things, odd moods and unexpected edits and unconventional compositions. He likes to keep things popping, and you can't help but respond to the wit and playfulness of his style.</Review>
            <Review>Wasikowska has that magnetic creep that pulls us to her, but the film is afflicted by the arthouse syndrome: it renounces its pulp roots and wishes to appear high-brow -- a pretension it can't sustain.</Review>
            <Review>The shame is that while the film is as glossy as late DePalma, essential Hitchcockiness is swapped out for random ickiness, a sorrow in light of Park's own history of crafting sleek, liquescent, swamping fever dreams.</Review>
            <Review>Enthralling and tremendously entertaining.</Review>
            <Review>Will no doubt be dismissed by a few as little more than a work of filmmaking panache. The panache, though, is what makes the film great.</Review>

            <Review>Alt horror about a Seattle surgery drop-out is a mediocre specimen of the Canadian kinky flesh genre of "Antiviral," "Crash" and "Kissed." End credits say "For Eli Roth."</Review>
            <Review>Writer-directors Jen and Sylvia Soska don't seem to have their material completely under control, but they've created a worthy entry in the Freaks school of cult cinema.</Review>
            <Review>This is truly a cut above.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director siblings Jen and Sylvia Soska allow their film to turn slack and unfocused after an enticingly lurid, wickedly tense first half.</Review>
            <Review>It's a truly interesting slasher fest; in this one, the heroine gets to be both beauty and beast.</Review>
            <Review>Combines gore, quiet dread, feminist conviction and a visual classicism, often using a red palette, with impressive, unbelabored dexterity.</Review>
            <Review>One of the strangest, darkest, and most confident "female-centric" horror flicks in quite some time.</Review>
            <Review>A sensational opening makes the disappointing final act hurt all the more as American Mary falls in a heap in its final act.</Review>
            <Review>Katharine Isabelle dominates the screen from the minute we meet her, and delivers a masterful performance.</Review>
            <Review>The almost excessively uneven narrative does, in the end, cancel out the effectiveness of the film's positive attributes...</Review>
            <Review>Watching Mary's unpleasant journey is intriguing and each character having identifiable quirks is a strong point, but unfortunately American Mary isn't really anything all that special otherwise.</Review>
            <Review>Sexy and delightfully deadpan, Katharine Isabelle absolutely kills it as loner med student Mary, so passionate about perfecting her surgical skills that she spends her evenings suturing turkey flesh.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Continuing where the first film left off, Nell Sweetzer (Ashley Bell) is found terrified and alone in rural Louisiana. Back in the relative safety of New Orleans, Nell realizes that she can't remember entire portions of the previous months only that she is the last surviving member of her family. Just as Nell begins the difficult process of starting a new life, the evil force that once possessed her is back with other, unimaginably horrific plans that mean her last exorcism was just the beginning.

        <StoryLine>Vladislav Vancura's novel Marketa Lazarova was based on a centuries-old Czechoslovakian legend. The film version concerns itself with a group of pillaging feudal lords. Though they regard themselves as noble knights, these lords are a raping, robbing lot, slaves to the many superstitions that grip their land. Magda Vasaryova plays Marketa Lazarova, whose misadventures begin when she is kidnapped and abused by the "protagonists." Director Frantisek Vlacil spares us nothing in bringing the Vancura novel to the screen, not even a gruesomely convincing public beheading. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>A wide-screen black-and-white feast for the eyes.</Review>

        <StoryLine>A sweet and hilarious fusion of gay romantic comedy, Jewish family drama and French bedroom farce, Mikael Buch's Let My People Go! follows the travails and daydreams of the lovelorn Reuben (Nicolas Maury), a French-Jewish gay mailman living in fairytale Finland (where he got his MA in "Comparative Sauna Cultures") with his gorgeous Nordic boyfriend. But just before Passover, a series of mishaps and a lovers' quarrel exile the heartbroken Reuben back to Paris and his zany family-including Almodovar goddess Carmen Maura as his ditzy mom, and Truffaut regular Jean-Fran�ois St�venin as his lothario father. Scripted by director Mikael Buch and renowned arthouse auteur Christophe Honor� (Love Songs), Let My People Go! both celebrates and upends Jewish and gay stereotypes with wit, gusto and style to spare. -- (C) Zeitgeist</StoryLine>

            <Review>Among gay Jewish French postman movies, "Let My People Go!" may be a Hall of Fame entry, but alas, by any other standard this would-be sex comedy is a dismal failure.</Review>
            <Review>Reuben is a whiny and uncoordinated prodigal son. His constant chafing at himself and the world is the film's biggest problem; by the midway point we're all wishing him back in Finland where he belongs.</Review>
            <Review>The result is late Woody Allen, when early might have done the trick.</Review>
            <Review>Though under 90 minutes, the whole frantically zany affair seems to last at least eight days. It might help to have a bottle of Manischewitz handy.</Review>
            <Review>Though the film alludes repeatedly to the story of Exodus, it remains bound to hysterical stereotypes and hyperbolic plotting.</Review>
            <Review>May well be the world's first French-Jewish-Finnish-Gay movie. Enjoyably campy.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2012</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>90</Duration>
        <StoryLine>In this disturbing, realistic debut a determined young female soldier interrogates an officer. Contrary to her colleagues' advice she accuses him of beating up an Arab family. She perseveres against the abuse of power in the army. A female Israeli soldier is ordered to interrogate an Israeli officer who is alleged to have abused an Arab family. Lower in rank and also a woman, she is barely taken seriously by the haughty man; he only gives her sarcastic answers. Her colleagues, including her lover, advise her to stop the case - because it is too political, too complex and too notorious. Instead, she fastens her teeth in it, in the hope of getting justice for the victims. In the meantime she has the thumbscrews tightened by her lover and his intended. All the interrogations take place in room 514, where the sound palette is formed only by voices and the air conditioning. Room 514 is a courageous, hyper-realistic, low-budget drama that provides a worrying and critical picture of Israeli Army culture, where young soldiers discover that good and evil, black and white, don't exist. This debut film filled with expressive, hand-held shots was recorded in only a few days.</StoryLine>

As they dock on a sun-kissed beach where children are playing and giggling, everything seems perfect.

        <Duration>85</Duration>
        <StoryLine>THE HAPPY POET is an all-organic, mostly vegetarian comedy about Bill, a struggling poet who pours his heart, soul, and last few dollars into starting a healthy food stand, surprising friends and customers with his dry wit and offbeat passion. Motivated by help from a rag-tag group of supporters and a budding romance with a poetry-loving customer, Bill strives to make a difference in the world, until surprising complications jeopardize his new friendships and threaten Bill's dreams for a hot dog-free future. THE HAPPY POET cleverly re-works the classic American film story of the underdog struggling against the system, adding a dose of deadpan humor and a fresh take on a young generation's interest in the intersection of a social conscience and the food we eat. -- (C) Cinema Libre</StoryLine>

            <Review>It's hardly slick, but that's the selling point. The Happy Poet approaches the ups and downs of friendship, love, work and life with a disposition that is both sardonic and sunny.</Review>
            <Review>This mumblecore entry sometimes sacrifices ambiguity for the sake of broader, telegraphed, one-note laughs.</Review>
            <Review>The smiley ending, most likely meant to be ironic, feels tacked on. But the consistent comic tone of those earlier scenes--a gentle squirm--makes The Happy Poet a promising debut.</Review>
            <Review>A cutting edge social satire about vegetarian pushcart power. And how work, or the lack of it, informs our lives. Along with the struggle to survive in hard times, while serving up poetic revenge subversion of the Hollywood happy ending with relish.</Review>

        <Title>Fred Won't Move Out</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2012</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>74</Duration>
        <StoryLine>With levity and sadness, two grown children and their aging parents struggle with the decision whether the older generation should stay in the house where they have lived for fifty years. Shot in the house where the director's parents lived for close to fifty years shortly after they moved out, the film's semi-autobiographical story is memorably acted by a small ensemble cast led by Elliott Gould. Shot in sequence in three weeks with a heady mix of improvisational work by both author Richard Ledes and his cast, the film's personal approach to its subject captures a universal story uniquely told. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>It has a great many shots of trees, leaves and insects and some story gaps.</Review>
            <Review>There is recognizable pain throughout Ledes' film. Yet it never pushes through to anything beyond a surface portrait.</Review>
            <Review>This carefully observed slice of life is dragged down by the dreary and distracting hand-held camerawork.</Review>
            <Review>Except for a subplot about a missing cat that suggests that Fred may be considerably dottier than he appears, the movie gets almost everything right about the uncomfortable moment when grown children are forced to be their parents' parents.</Review>
            <Review>Mostly, it captures how old age decimates even the people who don't suffer from it.</Review>
            <Review>This thoughtful but exceedingly modest miniature will be best nursed within the festival circuit.</Review>

            <Review>The twister that comes to whirl Oscar into Oz is so preordained you could find its departure information and flight time from an airport travel board.</Review>
            <Review>This eye-filling fantasy is an entertaining riff on how the Wizard of that immortal film found his way to Oz.</Review>
            <Review>An imaginative mix of live-action and CGI that pays homage to the iconic images and timeless sense of wonder in the classic The Wizard of Oz without being too deferential.</Review>
            <Review>Oz the Great and Powerful is entirely serviceable family entertainment. Problem is, serviceable doesn't quite cut it when you're talking about the magical land of Oz.</Review>
            <Review>Aside from a trio of witches that can hold its own with Eastwick's in the dishiness department, Oz the Great and Powerful is a peculiarly joyless occasion.</Review>
            <Review>Let us take a moment to praise two great and surprisingly powerful characters: a winged monkey and a wee girl made out of china. Because so much human wonder resides in these two creations of make-up, puppetry, digital effects and lovely performances.</Review>
            <Review>This is most definitely a 'Sam Raimi film,' filled with shots and camera techniques he perfected in the Evil Dead pictures before bringing them to the mainstream.</Review>
            <Review>The script just isn't that compelling. The film looks pretty great, but it's ultimately flash over substance; a boredom recipe for anyone over the age of 6.</Review>
            <Review>Visually, Oz: The Great and Powerful is a delight that caters to all ages.</Review>
            <Review>For as high it soars in its opening twenty-five minutes, its midsection falls just as flat, before its director takes back the reigns in time for an exceptional finale.</Review>
            <Review>Disney spent more than $200 million on this special effects film, and while the pacing and the visuals captivate, it's really James Franco's performance as the Wizard and an abundance of allusions to the 1939 classic that make it fun.</Review>
            <Review>While the movie looks great and kicks into satisfying high gear as it heads toward the last act...the tinhorn feeling of the bulk...leaves one yearning for another trip down the yellow brick road-the one first glimpsed by audiences in 1939.</Review>

            <Review>June Carter Cash is the kind of performer you just naturally tend to like, and you'll like her even more after seeing this new biopic.</Review>
            <Review>Jewel hits the right notes as June Carter Cash, but dutiful biopic doesn't quite carry a tune.</Review>
            <Review>Ross, who does a creepy, sniveling guy better than anyone, is totally miscast playing big, rough, tough Cash. In fact, it's so incomprehensible that it's, well, creepy.</Review>
            <Review>Except for the chance to hear a few country classics, the movie doesn't offer much else.</Review>
            <Review>Ring Of Fire compresses some sixty years in the life of June Carter Cash into roughly an hour and a half of screen time, not counting commercials.</Review>
            <Review>In making Johnny's drug abuse the main story of their life together, it leaves June to react to his actions, his troubles, and his needs.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Visionary, radical, spiritual seeker, renowned poet, founding member of a major literary movement, champion of human rights, Buddhist, political activist and teacher-Allen Ginsberg's remarkable life shaped the very soul of American counterculture. For 25 years, Academy Award (R)-nominated director Jerry Aronson accumulated more than 120 hours of film on Allen Ginsberg, resulting in this comprehensive portrait of one of America's greatest poets, author of Howl and other groundbreaking poems. The DVD includes exclusive and revealing interviews with his friends, family and contemporaries as well as never-before-seen materials made public because of the warm friendship that developed between subject and director. This compilation reveals the last 60 years of American culture beginning with the Beat era in the post-war Forties and Fifties, continuing through the revolutionary Sixties and concluding with the uncertainty and possibility of current times.

            <Review>There's a winning confidence to the filmmaking, which is deceptively stylish - Dupieux favours nervy close-ups and blurred foregrounds - and some real soul in Plotnick's performance.</Review>
            <Review>Dupieux makes the viewer work for it with Wrong. And it's not always worth the effort ...</Review>
            <Review>Dupieux has to be applauded for creating a unique universe, but sometimes he seems stuck in it - to the point where we feel we're not always in on the joke.</Review>
            <Review>In Wrong, reality and the world of the film will regularly upend themselves; it's never quite reliably clear, though, that these inexplicable events are happening for a purpose.</Review>
            <Review>Dupieux doesn't make films for everyone, but he does craft creative and abstract trips that are more than worth going on, even if they're fantastically difficult to explain to anyone who has yet to join the club.</Review>
            <Review>Dupieux's absurdism is simply muddled, masking the fact he doesn't really have much to say.</Review>
            <Review>The whole film feels a bit like a dream after a late-night burrito, leaving you wondering if moments in the film actually happened, particularly when mulling over it the next day.</Review>
            <Review>Apart from arousing fitful curiosity, this stretch of surrealism yawns into an arid expanse of flat quirkiness. Meanders between torquing noir clichés and drifting through a funhouse-mirror-maze of SoCal conventions. Little strange poetry emerges.</Review>
            <Review>Wrong wears out its welcome even at 94 minutes.</Review>
            <Review>A work of much playfulness and imagination, Wrong hints at a broader promise of budding, starburst auteurism upon which the film as a whole -- a nice, silly riff that could work better in truncated form -- doesn't fully deliver.</Review>
            <Review>Quentin Dupieux's brand of absurdism lands somewhere between the plays of Eugène Ionesco, the looniest sketches of Monty Python, and the most adventurous efforts of the Adult Swim brigade.</Review>
            <Review>This isn't a long film, but it lacks propulsion at times. Luckily, it maintains its wry outlook and never quite erases the good will that its best moments inspire.</Review>

            <Review>There are plenty of antecedents for the story, like "The Prince and the Pauper" and "Dave." But what it lacks in originality, it makes up for in Lee's performance.</Review>
            <Review>As predictable as these stories invariably are, Lee's wonderful turn reignites the potent fantasy of peasant wisdom - if given the power - melting politically cynical hearts and legislating through decency rather than fear.</Review>
            <Review>Following in the long tradition of lavish Asian epics, this new South Korean entry is a beautiful addition to the genre of period prince-and-the pauper themed films.</Review>
            <Review>Competently directed, the real pleasure in this high-grossing South Korean film lies in its performances, which lighten the regal solemnity with comic warmth.</Review>
            <Review>As entertainment, it's a decidedly unstuffy costume drama that's compelling to the end.</Review>
            <Review>a somewhat sentimental tale of royal intrigue and romance; a crash course on the claustrophobic, often bizarre details of courtly life; and a showcase for the acting talents of Korean superstar Lee Byung-hun, in dual roles.</Review>
            <Review>Director Choo Chang-min delivers a familiar tale with elegant skill and assurance. He proves that if you have a good story, there's no need to gild the lily.</Review>
            <Review>It's a robust, colorful, masterfully-spun yarn. It calls to mind the great MGM technicolor swashbucklers of the forties and fifties, particularly The Prisoner of Zenda</Review>
            <Review>Lavishly entertaining Korean period spectacle works on every level from an ancient but still effective source.</Review>

            <Review>Snitch runs close to two hours, and it's a credit to Summit Entertainment that they didn't reduce it to 90 minutes of Mexican drug loons trying to run John's truck off the highway.</Review>
            <Review>The film tries to paint in shades of gray with vague criticisms of the war on drugs, but the absurdity of its he-man Everyman plot ends up turning its moral palette a muddy brown.</Review>
            <Review>In the end, this is a movie that lives or dies on Johnson's performance, and luckily, the actor is perfect ...</Review>
            <Review>Yes, this is a film where The Rock Wikipedias "drug cartels." But somehow it works.</Review>
            <Review>Despite its apparent compromises to noble finger-wagging (initially) and requisite fist-pumping (eventually), Waugh has fashioned a sturdy character-first entertainment out of Snitch.</Review>
            <Review>Dwayne Johnson tries so hard to be taken seriously in the ponderous and preposterous drama Snitch that it hurts to watch him in much the same way it hurts to watch the weightlifting competition at the summer Olympics.</Review>
            <Review>"Snitch" is passable thanks to a sturdy second act and a decent performance by Dwayne Johnson, but it's never captivating.</Review>
            <Review>Effectively illustrates the great heights we occasionally rise to for the ones we love.</Review>
            <Review>Although hardly original, this tightly paced story will keep you invested through to the end</Review>
            <Review>A pseudo-serious hand-wringing action drama that uses social importance to disguise its unoriginality.</Review>
            <Review>It's intense and involving from the start, even when it turns preachy.</Review>

            <Review>More of a tribute than a hard-hitting piece of American filmmaking, which is too bad, because the subject - the imprisonment of ex-Black Panther figure Mumia Abu-Jamal - deserves a thorough, serious examination.</Review>
            <Review>Director Stephen Vittoria lines up a roster of writers and educators, actors and activists, to sing Abu-Jamal's praise. And praise they do.</Review>
            <Review>A film that would let us decide the pros and cons of his life for ourselves would certainly be welcome.</Review>
            <Review>"Mumia" gradually becomes a persuasive attempt to celebrate the content of his character, not the violence that apparently led to his imprisonment.</Review>
            <Review>Vittoria avoids discussing the crime for which Abu-Jamal spent 29 years in solitary confinement on death row, instead tracing the path of a brilliant journalist whose message cannot be silenced.</Review>
            <Review>The doc is unapologetically one-sided, and spends more time canonizing Abu-Jamal than exploring the murder and trial themselves.</Review>
            <Review>A movie about the liberating power of words that bends over backwards to paste flashy images on top of sentences that already speak for themselves.</Review>
            <Review>You don't have to agree with Abu-Jamal's politics to admire his work ethic-or his eloquence.</Review>
            <Review>Long Distance Revolutionary is a blistering indictment of institutionalized racism and also a sensitive picture of a fascinating human being.</Review>
            <Review>This tiresome documentary on activist journalist and convicted murderer Mumia Abu-Jamal buries its subject under waves of gratingly repetitive accolades.</Review>
            <Review>A documentary charting the extraordinary life and work of Mumia Abu-Jamal from his prison cell over the last 30 years.</Review>

            <Review>Is there such a thing as "tastefully smutty"? Director Im Sang-soo's moody and semi-Shakespearian The Taste of Money walks that line with some artfully lit humping and cross-generational seduction.</Review>
            <Review>As the sexual, financial and criminal shenanigans get ever more complicated, absurd and melodramatic, the film becomes increasingly tiresome; it's not even possible to enjoy its excesses in a 'so bad it's good' way.</Review>

            <Review>It feels like Im intended this as a moral fable. He should have played for laughs; material this blunt works best as satire.</Review>
            <Review>Sex, death, greed, corruption: they're all here in handsomely mounted and highly polished cases. Taste the money - smell the glove.</Review>

        <StoryLine>If a political candidate is personally flawed, but stands to make a positive difference in millions of lives, would you help him win? That question looms over the life of "true believer" Paul Turner (Rob Lowe), a savvy strategist sharply maneuvering politicians out of scandal and into public office. With the help of a bright young assistant (Jamie Chung) and a seedy operative (Richard Schiff), Turner spins every news cycle and a shrewd reporter (Julie Bowen) on behalf of his clients: a philandering Kentucky governor (Eric McCormick), a blackmailed California senator (David Harbour), and an idealistic doctor turned gubernatorial candidate (Carrie-Anne Moss). When the ugly side of Turner's work begins to haunt him, he learns that even in the bloodiest of battles, sometimes you have to fight clean. (c) IFC Films</StoryLine>

            <Review>His flamboyant rendering of the Mozart opera isn't as smug and stagey as Sleuth, but it is insufferable - and 40 minutes longer.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Join filmmaker Roger Paradiso as he follows two hip-hop legends on their quest to reclaim the names that were wrongfully stolen from them, and get the credit they've been denied for 30 years. In 1979, the Sugarhill Gang released the single "Rapper's Delight." An instant hit, it brought hip-hop music to the masses, and inspired generations of talented young rappers. Incredibly, what happened next is every musical artist's worst nightmare. Rife with corruption, the powers that be at Sugarhill Records erased the names of original writers and band members Wonder Mike (Michael Wright) and Master Gee (Guy O'Brien) on every release, trademarked both of their stage names and the name of the group, and commenced to making millions as the artists who wrote the music never saw a dime. Now, after three decades of injustice, the original members of the Sugarhill Gang break the silence about the swindle that cost them everything.</StoryLine>

        <Duration>108</Duration>
        <StoryLine>What would be the shortest route between Entre Ros in Argentina and the Chinese metropolis Shanghai? Simply a straight line through the center of the earth, since the two places are antipodes: they are located diametrically opposite to each other on the earth's surface. During his visits to four such antipodal pairs, the award-winning documentary filmmaker Victor Kossakovsky captured images that turn our view of the world upside down. A beautiful, peaceful sunset in Entre Ros is contrasted with the bustling streets in rainy Shanghai. People who live in a wasteland are connected to people dwelling next to a volcano. Landscapes whose splendor touches the soul are juxtaposed with the clamor of a vast city. These antipodes seem mythically connected, somehow united by their oppositeness. Kossakovsky's movie is a feast for the senses, a fascinating kaleidoscope of our planet. Vivan Las Antipodas! - Long Live The Antipodes! (c) Cinedigm</StoryLine>

            <Review>Unlike, say, similar globetrotting, image-led works like Koyaanisqatsi or Baraka, Kossakovsky's film is never preachy, allowing the visuals to percolate.</Review>
            <Review>You emerge wondering what (and who) might lie beneath your own feet.</Review>
            <Review>Lovely stuff.</Review>

            <Review>A living sculpture of sky, water, landscapes, and the tiny figures (humans and other animals) that inhabit them.</Review>
            <Review>Vivan las Antipodas! is never dull, thanks to Kossakovsky's constant inventiveness, always offering fresh perspectives, either through the physical angle of shooting or through the interesting juxtaposition of life on either side of the planet.</Review>
            <Review>'We are one' may have seemed like a twee message in the hands of a lesser artist, but Kossakovsky handles it with grace and intelligence.</Review>

            <Review>A sub-Apatovian farce that tries way too hard ...</Review>
            <Review>A noisy stab at wacky wrongness that starts with reasonably plump possibility as a dispatch from the frontlines of viral video embarrassment hell.</Review>
            <Review>A vibrantly vulgar comedy that never hangs around to admire its own cleverness.</Review>
            <Review>Tragically unfunny, Frankie is occasionally elevated by some of its gifted and game cast, but the film's nasty, comedically incoherent script limits its potential.</Review>
            <Review>Both actors somehow stay grounded despite all the shenanigans. Hunnam, in particular, is quite adept at playing against his movie-star looks.</Review>
            <Review>Provided one submits to its base level of intentional ridiculousness, there's some wacky charm to be found in this low-budget comedy of fraternal bickering.</Review>
            <Review>Toxic brother drives so-so comedy about mortifying video.</Review>
            <Review>... provides a few solid sitcom-style laughs before the bickering and mayhem become repetitive and the film simply runs out of gas.</Review>
            <Review>It's unbearable to sit through at times, watching decent actors flounder with intentionally ridiculous material, working themselves into a lather to serve writer/director Jordan Roberts's clumsy sense of humor.</Review>

        <Duration>98</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Jamie Chung stars in a searing contemporary drama, based on the true story of a Korean-American teenager who is kidnapped from a bar in New Mexico and transformed into a sex slave in Las Vegas by a band of ruthless international thugs. Beau Bridges plays an avuncular federal marshal, a good ol' boy, who turns out to be one of the operation's masterminds while Matt O'Leary is equally repellent as the boss's wildly erratic, drug-addled right-hand man. But it's Chung who breathes life into a story that could have been reduced to violent, even pornographic sensationalism, if not told so compassionately from the victim's point of view. Human trafficking is a $32 billion-a-year business, perpetrated throughout the world. EDEN gives a thoughtful, albeit mind-boggling perspective on how these crimes are sometimes committed in America within plain sight.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Griffiths lays bare a many-tentacled trafficking system sickening in its reach.</Review>
            <Review>A quite moving performance comes from Jamie Chung as Eden, repulsion sliding into fearful acceptance without the extinction of hope.</Review>
            <Review>Nearly every second is taken up with the horrors inflicted upon the heroine by the sorriest bunch of good ol' boy sadists since "Deliverance."</Review>
            <Review>Griffiths and her screenwriter, Rick Phillips Jr., manage the tricky business of evoking the specific horrors of sex slavery without languishing in the lurid and graphic.</Review>
            <Review>A few moments harp on the sentimental, but overall, this is a powerful addition to the small collection of films dedicated to spreading awareness of this horrific crime.</Review>
            <Review>Griffiths makes gripping drama from it all, thanks to an observant camera and nuanced characters.</Review>
            <Review>Jamie Chung gives a reserved, watchful performance, but the true surprise is perpetual nice guy Beau Bridges in a nasty turn as the head trafficker.</Review>
            <Review>Eden surprises by managing to paint a vivid and disturbing picture of the trafficking experience within the context of a conventional thriller.</Review>
            <Review>It's chilling, convincing, matter-of-fact realism.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Set in 1870 in the immediate aftermath of the Civil War, DEAD MAN'S BURDEN is the story of Martha (Clare Bowen, ABC's Nashville) and her husband Heck (David Call, Tiny Furniture), who are struggling to make ends meet on the rural New Mexico frontier. When a mining company expresses interest in buying their land, Martha and Heck see their ticket to a better life. Their hopeful plans are soon complicated when Martha's oldest brother Wade (Barlow Jacobs, Shotgun Stories), presumed dead during the war, returns to the family homestead after learning of their father's death. A defector to the Union Army, Wade soon discovers that Martha is hiding secrets of her own. As the two siblings become reacquainted, torn between a desire to reconcile with the only family they have left and their clashing convictions, tension and suspicion continue to mount. Filmed on location in the rugged high desert of northern New Mexico, DEAD MAN'S BURDEN, shot in the style of a classic western, marks Jared Mosh�'s directorial debut. (c) CineDigm</StoryLine>

            <Review>It's a strong debut for Moshe, who, with the exception of some of the oater dialogue, shows both a reverence for and a knowledge of the genre that's intriguing.</Review>
            <Review>Ponderous but lovely, simple but elegant, it should appeal to fans of Westerns.</Review>
            <Review>Small in scale but with a grand visual ambition, "Dead Man's Burden" draws nourishment from its burned-out desert setting and ambling pace.</Review>
            <Review>Despite visual nods to dozens of classic Westerns, the film cannot break through with its own vision.</Review>
            <Review>The story is modest to the point of occasionally seeming slight, and the ending is a tad too cute in the way it circles back to the beginning, but even those flaws just make it feel more authentic. See it now, before it gets rediscovered.</Review>
            <Review>You never get over the feeling that you're watching modern actors play frontier-drama dress-up. It's a deathblow.</Review>
            <Review>Moshé immediately establishes an unforgiving milieu for his moody, minimalist Western.</Review>
            <Review>The movie offers a convincing look at the sort of irreparable damage the Civil War did to families, but too often it feels like self-conscious role-play.</Review>
            <Review>Dead Man's Burden isn't [great], but it's not a bad horse opera and is unflinching in its depictions of harshness and violence.</Review>
            <Review>Oddly lifeless, despite the clearly devoted efforts of the cast and crew: It's admirable without being particularly engaging, so respectful of its cinematic predecessors that its own voice is strangled.</Review>
            <Review>It's always a pleasure to encounter genre ambition contained in such a sinewy-shot, emotionally resonant, and gorgeously photographed package.</Review>
            <Review>Though it sometimes wears its influences a tad too openly, Dead Man's Burden is still an atmospheric and emotionally satisfying indie western that could spark interest among serious fans of the genre.</Review>

        <Duration>95</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Warner Baxter, sporting a black mustache and a musical-comedy Mexican accent, stars as the Cisco Kid, the "Robin Hood of the Old West" created by O. Henry. Edmund Lowe co-stars as Cisco's "friendly enemy" Sgt. Mickey Dunne, the role that was originally to have gone to Raoul Walsh. Both men are madly in love with dusky beauty Tonia Maria (Dorothy Burgess), and in fact Cisco is so "far gone" that he composes a song in the girl's honor (actually, "My Tonia", first heard during the opening credits, was written by Fox studio tunesmiths Lew Brown, B.G. DeSylva and Ray Henderson). Alas, Tonia ends up betraying Cisco to Sgt. Burke. But the crafty, cold-blooded Cisco arranges for Tonia to be killed in the trap set for him (this plot resolution is faithful to O. Henry's original conception of the Cisco Kid, who wasn't really meant to be a "good guy"). ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>The first major Western in sound...One can occasionally feel the filmmakers showing off the technology, with close-ups of a crying baby or sizzling ham and eggs. [Blu-ray]</Review>
            <Review>Famous for being the first major sound western, this picture made progressive use of exterior sound and photography.</Review>
            <Review>Uneven film with brilliant comedy relief by Edmund Lowe, and lots to interest fans of Raoul Walsh.</Review>
            <Review>Warner Baxter, better known as the dying producer in 42nd Street, won Best Actor Oscar as the Cisco Kid in this primitivee Western, most of which takes place indoorse.</Review>

            <Review>Walsh presents the action in his usual clear, well-paced and exciting manner.</Review>
            <Review>If it appears that I'm being too hard on this film, one doesn't have to look very far to see far superior films, both sound and silent, released around the same time.</Review>

            <Review>It's not gruesome enough to please genre fans, but not nearly funny enough to be a comedy either. It tries to be a mixture of both and fails.</Review>
            <Review>A muddled teenpic.</Review>
            <Review>This is a love story, done with charm, humor, and tenderness.</Review>
            <Review>It's all very silly and sweet in that indie-nostalgic way that Levine ('The Wackness' and '50/50') has made his own.</Review>
            <Review>Warm Bodies doesn't even have the conviction to follow through on its lame ideas, let alone its good ones. It's a mostly terrible film that misses the opportunity to be a merely mediocre one.</Review>
            <Review>This is a bloody fresh twist on the zombie genre.</Review>
            <Review>The pallid, flesh-eating hunk in this case is played with appropriate weirdo charm by Nicholas Hoult.</Review>
            <Review>At its most stylish, the picture is worth taking in - the music video vibe overwhelms at times - but then it snaps out of its trance with nothing in particular to say.</Review>
            <Review>I liked it better than Zombieland, if you're lookimg for something in a similar wheelhouse.</Review>
            <Review>To truly appreciate this zombie Romeo &amp; Juliet you either go all the way with it or not at all.</Review>
            <Review>It's a toss-up which genre more needs the adrenaline boost Warm Bodies provides: the zombie movie or the romantic comedy.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2012</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>104</Duration>
        <StoryLine>After a meteoric rise to radio super-stardom in the late 1940's, Hank Williams, who called himself Luke the Drifter, had made a train wreck of his life. At the end of 1952, Hank Williams gathered what was left of his physical strength to make things right and began the long road back. On his way to a couple of New Year's shows in West Virginia and Ohio, he hired a local kid who didn't even own a radio, much less know who this legend was, to drive him to the gigs from Montgomery, AL. Hank Williams never got there. Inspired by the mysterious final days of Hank Williams' life, The Last Ride is the story of that final drive through the bleak Appalachian countryside of 1950's America. -- (C) Category One</StoryLine>

            <Review>The 1952 El Dorado represents Williams' success as a songwriter and country singer, but it also serves as his refuge from an increasingly chaotic life.</Review>
            <Review>Alas, "The Last Ride" doesn't deliver much insight into Williams or the lifestyle that killed him.</Review>
            <Review>The Last Ride doesn't give us a complete picture of Hank Williams. But it does ably illustrate the final days of his life.</Review>
            <Review>James does a fine job of portraying a naïve youth whose eyes slowly open to glimpse both the pleasures and the pain of living.</Review>
            <Review>Dramatically thin, formally uninspired and thematically weak, "The Last Ride" really goes nowhere.</Review>
            <Review>Bearing all the hallmarks of a small-budget labor of love, The Last Ride is a leisurely paced but modestly engaging road trip that gets considerable mileage from the byplay between its two lead characters.</Review>
            <Review>A romantic "what-if" version of the story, interesting only as a cultural artifact...dramatically inert</Review>
            <Review>Henry Thomas shows he beat the child star jinx with his heartfelt portrayal of Hank Williams.</Review>
            <Review>The Last Ride squanders its potential, much like its tragic subject.</Review>
            <Review>Alabama teen drives country-music star Hank Williams on his fatal trip to a concert in West Virginia. Squeaky-clean period tale is well-mounted but thin.</Review>
            <Review>A typical wax-museum reproduction of the American South in which every detail is Southern in bold all caps, and not a single scene over the course of the film's 102 minutes rings true.</Review>
            <Review>... an evocation of an era, of a lost-highway America evidenced today only in the roadside ruins of old service stations and downtown hotels, of a South before it was swamped by leveling and homogenizing waves of globalization and television.</Review>

            <Review>I didn't think it was physically possible to doze off at a movie as loud as A Good Day to Die Hard, but for a few moments my mind found some distant, peaceful refuge.</Review>
            <Review>It's all more than a little silly, but Willis' presence at least provides undercurrents of easy jocularity.</Review>
            <Review>For anyone who remembers the "Die Hard" adventures at their vital and exciting best, this film feels like a near-death experience.</Review>
            <Review>Few fans of the series would disagree that this sclerotic fifth installment should probably be the last.</Review>
            <Review>It is, for anyone who loved the original films, an abomination.</Review>

            <Review>Guerrero's attitude toward the teenagers - understanding and affectionate, without being cloying - is what holds your interest.</Review>
            <Review>"Mosquita y Mari," an unassuming indie jewel, resists all of the clichés that its story of the fraught friendship between two 15-year-old girls invites.</Review>
            <Review>[It] doesn't aim to make any grand statements. It doesn't need to. The sweetness and sincerity Guerrero and her leads infuse into their intimate coming-of-age story is more than enough.</Review>
            <Review>First-time writer-director Aurora Guerrero beautifully captures the fluctuating dynamics of friendship between 15-year-old girls in Mosquita y Mari.</Review>
            <Review>The film thankfully resists being either a typical coming-out movie or an ethnocultural curio, but it doesn't offer much insight into the twosome's attraction, platonic or otherwise, to each other.</Review>
            <Review>Unreels with outstanding compassion and tenderness, and authentic detail...</Review>
            <Review>It knows the conventions surrounding the type of tale it is telling, and it steers clear of them...</Review>

        <Duration>89</Duration>
        <StoryLine>The 3D animated family comedy catapults moviegoers to planet Baab where admired astronaut Scorch Supernova (Brendan Fraser) is a national hero to the blue alien population. A master of daring rescues, Scorch pulls off astonishing feats with the quiet aid of his nerdy, by-the-rules brother, Gary (Rob Corddry), head of mission control at BASA. When BASA's no-nonsense chief Lena (Jessica Alba) informs the brothers of an SOS from a notoriously dangerous planet, Scorch rejects Gary's warnings and bounds off for yet another exciting mission. But when Scorch finds himself caught in a fiendish trap set by the evil Shanker (William Shatner) it's up to scrawny, risk-adverse Gary to do the real rescuing. As the interplanetary stakes rise to new heights, Gary is left to save his brother, his planet, his beloved wife Kira (Sarah Jessica Parker) and their adventure hungry son Kip.

            <Review>Just like its hero and his grounded starship, Escape From Planet Earth is, for much of the film, a decidedly earthbound adventure.</Review>
            <Review>Colorful as the 3-D aliens-among-us comedy is to look at, though, Corddry is handed a role that's beige as can be, and so are his castmates.</Review>
            <Review>A lightweight, warp-speed, brightly colored trifle that should delight small children and sporadically amuse their parents.</Review>
            <Review>It never discovers new worlds, but "Escape From Planet Earth" is, in its genial way, escape enough.</Review>
            <Review>A children's movie about space-traveling blue beings that has lots of high-flying escapades but fairly low aspirations.</Review>
            <Review>One only has to think of Battlefield Earth and After Earth to realise that putting the name of our planet into a movie title isn't always a good idea. Happily, Escape From Planet Earth is a reasonable exception.</Review>
            <Review>The animation is hardly out of this world, but a script polish from Stephen Fry and others means that there is a sprinkling of good gags to accompany the siblings' adventures.</Review>
            <Review>This is very much by-numbers pre-teen fare, spiced up by the sound of William Shatner enjoying himself.</Review>
            <Review>Its secret weapon is a satirically inclined script, reworked by Stephen Fry among others, that disrupts the general factory-line vibe with regular funny lines.</Review>
            <Review>It's a lively, unpretentious adventure that should delight young children and has enough pop culture gags and sly humor to amuse their parents.</Review>
            <Review>A painted-by-numbers 3D kid-flick enlivened mostly by Rob Corddry, who plays the fastidious, nerdy brother to Brendan Fraser's doomed Buzz Lightyear clone.</Review>

He refuses to go to college, after being accepted at Brown, and is interested in nothing - barring visits to his enigmatic, free-spirited grandmother Nanette, played by Oscar winner Ellen Burstyn, the only one who seems to understand just how lost a restless 17-year-old can feel while trying to find himself in a confusing world. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>Up until he becomes somewhat manly, Bateman's character's supreme ineptness is less funny than nerve-wracking. There's way more grossness than hilarity. Don't get conned.</Review>

        <StoryLine>From Myriad Pictures, CHARLIE ZONE is a twisting dramatic thriller set against the drug-ravaged streets of one of Canada's roughest neighborhoods. Avery Paul, a disgraced boxer and ex-convict, is hired to abduct a runaway from a crack house in the city's notorious "Charlie Zone," and return her safely to her family. But nothing goes quite as planned and nothing is quite what it seems. What follows is a harrowing ride through the underbelly of a seemingly picture-postcard Canadian city, as two lost people attempt to face the darkness-in their world and themselves-and hopefully find redemption.

        <StoryLine>Star Gloria Swanson also co-produced this British film, a romantic comedy/drama that teamed her with a young Laurence Olivier. Judy Rogers (Swanson), an American vacationing in England, meets aristocrat Nicholas Randall (Olivier) and the two fall in love. They agree to marry but insist they'll never have any disagreements -- while both intending to maintain their independence. After an idyllic honeymoon, they are separated briefly and Nicholas strays with Lady Stephanie Fitzmaurice (Nora Swinburne). After he confesses to Judy, she decides to date the eligible Ivan Ronnson (John Halliday), but keeps the encounter a flirtation only. Their marriage becomes shaky, but Judy and Nicholas weather their doubts and come to love each other all the more. Note the film's co-writer: Michael Powell, who would later direct, write, and produce Black Narcissus and The Red Shoes (in collaboration with Emeric Pressburger). ~ Nicole Gagne, Rovi</StoryLine>

As questions are asked, personal stories about their lives are revealed, from why they chose the business of sex to how they got into it in the first place. These porn stars have always been discreet about their private lives in the past, yet Anderson has a way of opening up a dialog allowing them to share more than just their naked skin on screen. Their true inner vulnerability is touching, yet the characters they have created are confident and intoxicating. Once you hear their stories, you'll never look at them in the same way again.

            <Review>It has an inviting softness, but the background music, odd camera angles, close-ups and lingering shots only distract and objectify.</Review>
            <Review>For a film that purports to go beyond the surface and uncover the "true essence" of adult film stars, "Aroused" spends a lot of time admiring the surface.</Review>
            <Review>Director Deborah Anderson ... turns a welcome opportunity into a shameless example of exploitation and self-promotion.</Review>
            <Review>Aspires to be a consciousness-raising documentary but is only as deep as a tube of lipstick ...</Review>
            <Review>'Aroused' is well done, and like the best documentaries and the best artwork it alters the way you see a subject and the way you think about things. But it is NOT arousing.</Review>

            <Review>Faux feminist quotes ridiculously compare the porn stars to Anais Nin, Joan of Arc and yes, Eleanor Roosevelt. As Anderson cheers them while they get gussied up for oral, anal and mock rape scenes, exposing their souls way less than flashing flesh.</Review>

        <Duration>101</Duration>
        <StoryLine>What is legal and what is just? The wide gap between the two is explored meticulously by this Israeli investigation (winner of the Best Documentary Award at the Sundance and Jerusalem Film Festivals) of the legal structure created after the 1967 Six Days War, specifically to treat the West Bank and Gaza Strip as occupied territories. Speaking with some of Israel's most respected lawyers and judges - men who helped to craft and later interpret these laws - filmmaker Ra'anan Alexandrowicz asks tough, pointed questions and gets even tougher answers. He asks his subjects to consider the consequences of their actions in a highly politicized environment. THE LAW IN THESE PARTS takes the position that unjust laws create unjust realities. Laws that everyone admits are not perfect but are the best that can be done under difficult circumstances may result in tragedy for everyone: both the judges and the judged.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Funny and fresh.</Review>
            <Review>Weaver's last ditch attempt to upend rom-com convention and rewrite the movie as a skeevy lout's comeuppance hardly makes up for the clichéd slog that comes before.</Review>
            <Review>Imagine Tucker Max minus the charm and you've got . . . well, Tucker Max, but also Blayne Weaver, the star-writer-director of the indie rom-com "6 Month Rule."</Review>
            <Review>An ostensible romantic comedy that's really just a grating portrait of an irredeemable jerk.</Review>
            <Review>As with the latest Kate Hudson comedy, it's a formula for irrelevancy pretty much as a rule.</Review>
            <Review>Budget indie-house comfort food for the '90s-romcom-besotted soul.</Review>
            <Review>If the plotting and payoffs of this love triangle are a bit problematic and less satisfying than one wished, there are also pleasant inversions to be found in the film's finale, reminding viewers that every down is a prelude to an up, and vice versa.</Review>
            <Review>There are some scattered amusing moments among the supporting characters, but the protagonist is consistently smug and pretentious.</Review>
            <Review>The film is far too indulgent with its lead character to do more than hint at the ways that one form of male egotism can morph into another.</Review>

            <Review>Lore, from Australian director Cate Shortland, proceeds like a long-ago fairy tale, dark-hued, grounded in real-life 20th-century horrors.</Review>
            <Review>The young principals here, Malina and especially Rosendahl, are superb at conveying that premature hardening, their elastic minds pummelled by inelastic forces.</Review>
            <Review>The sins of the Fatherland send a German teenage girl and her Nazi-connected family on the run in Australian director Cate Shortland's vividly rendered and sensual drama Lore.</Review>
            <Review>It's a harrowing walk through the heart of darkness.</Review>
            <Review>With a child's perspective on war, "Lore" deserves comparisons with "Empire of the Sun" and "Hope and Glory," and with a feisty female protagonist it stands virtually alone.</Review>
            <Review>Saskia Rosendahl gives an impressively poised performance as the beautiful teenager, whose determination to protect her remaining family coincides with her growing revulsion toward her parents.</Review>
            <Review>Remarkable. Raw, disorienting and it never bothers to tell you what it can instead show.</Review>
            <Review>Cate Shortland infuses a fresh perspective and a haunting moral quandary to the WWII genre, bringing a little seen part of human history to chilling life.</Review>
            <Review>Rosendahl puts the onslaught of horror and absurdity in poignant perspective with her limpid depiction of her character's growing resourcefulness and awareness.</Review>
            <Review>Lore is a akin to a bourgeois German version of Elem Klimov's 1985 Belarus-set Come and See, and it has some outstanding features. The star turn is the lurking cinematography of Adam Arkapaw.</Review>
            <Review>The deep-feeling Rosendahl makes a major impression as an intelligent girl learning the power of her sexuality and resolve under maximum stress.</Review>
            <Review>Shortland may not leave us with certainty, but in the context of so bloody a conflict fueled by intransigence and misguided idealism, the hope and the beauty of Lore is only strengthened by its embrace of youthful uncertainty.</Review>

            <Review>With Cusack's help, Barfoed holds your interest without resorting to car chases, a rarity in a contemporary thriller.</Review>

        <Title>The Dark Command</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 1940</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>95</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Set in the years leading up to the Civil War and its outbreak, Dark Command tells a fictionalized version of the story of William Clarke Quantrill, the schoolteacher-turned-renegade, whose raids -- ostensibly on behalf of the Confederacy -- turned Kansas into a charnel house. John Wayne plays Bob Setton, a young Texan who arrives in Lawrence, KS, in 1859 on his way west, partnered with George "Gabby" Hayes. He meets Marie McCloud (Claire Trevor) and her younger brother, Fletch (Roy Rogers), and takes a liking to them, especially Marie. His only competition for her is William Cantrell (Walter Pidgeon), the local schoolteacher, who has big ambitions in life. He is nominated for town marshal and seems a shoo-in, especially as his only rival is Bob Setton, who admits he knows nothing about the law and can't even read, but Setton wins with his honest, unpretentious speech. At the time, Kansas is riven by strife, as settlers from the North opposed to slavery and those from the South supporting it pour into the territory, and Setton has his hands full. His most difficult personal moment comes when he must arrest Fletch for shooting an anti-slavery farmer (Trevor Bardette) to death. Cantrell leads a campaign of terror against the jury, however, which finds the young man not guilty just as the Civil War breaks out. In the months that follow, Setton and his posse go after the raiders who are stealing and destroying huge amounts of property in Kansas on behalf of the Confederacy. He suspects Cantrell is their leader, but can't prove it, and has to tread carefully. As the raids worsen, and the war drags on -- even Marie's pro-Confederacy banker father is murdered during a run on his bank -- their conflict comes to a violent end as Cantrell launches an attack on Lawrence, vowing to destroy the town, with only Bob Setton and Cantrell's own mother (Marjorie Main) standing in his way. ~ Bruce Eder, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>Thomas Bach (Victor Brown) is on top of his game. A popular right-wing radio talk-show host in Minneapolis and a hero of the Tea Party Movement, he is handpicked to run for the U.S. Senate. But first he must fly to Los Angeles and clean up some dirty laundry that might damage his campaign. A victim of an attack, Thomas wakes up on the streets of Los Angeles without his memory and unaware that he is a diabetic. Wandering skid row, he inevitably blends in with the homeless population and, without medication, becomes more and more ill. As he experiences both the violence and hardship as well as the courage and humanity of the homeless community, a more compassionate Thomas Bach emerges. Upon regaining his memory a week later, Thomas returns home, a hero of the media, with a great story for the campaign. But with experiences that conflict with his political rhetoric, he now faces a choice between career and conscience. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

        <Title>In Old California</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 1942</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>89</Duration>
        <StoryLine>With its slight resemblance to Destry Rides Again (1939) -- probably not entirely coincidental -- this rousing Western from Republic Pictures remains a joy throughout. John Wayne plays Tom Craig, a mild-mannered druggist from Boston who opens a shop in wild and woolly Sacramento shortly before the Gold Rush. The town is "owned" by the Dawson brothers, Britt (Albert Dekker) and Joe (Dick Purcell), who poison Craig's tonic when saloon hostess Lacey Miller (Binnie Barnes) takes too much of an interest in the handsome newcomer. Town drunk Whitey (Emmett Lynn) has one drink too many, and all of Sacramento is soon in a lynching mood. The news of "gold in them thar hills" saves the druggist in the nick of time, but his business is destroyed. While everyone is heading for the gold fields, Craig prepares to leave town with snobbish debutante Ellen Sanford (Helen Parrish), whom he intends to marry. News of typhoid fever among the prospectors changes his mind, however, and the man once referred to as "a human hitchin' post instead of a two-legged man," risks his own life to save the suffering populace. The Dawson brothers, meanwhile, plan to hijack the medical supplies and sell them to the highest bidder, but when Britt Dawson learns that Lacey is helping the sick and may be stricken with the disease herself, he has a change of heart and eventually confesses to spiking Craig's medicine. Cast against type for most of the film, John Wayne fails to make his amiable druggist entirely believable but remains simply John Wayne throughout -- which is as it should be. Binnie Barnes is rowdy and fun whether leading a chorus of "California Joe" by Johnny Marvin and Fred Rose, or jealously interrupting a t�te-�-t�te between Wayne and 19-year-old Helen Parrish. Usually cast as glacial "other women" in Hollywood films, the British-born Barnes had actually begun her professional career touring Europe and South Africa with bucolic American headliner Tex McLeod, which was as good a preparation as any to play In Old California's saloon belle. Patsy Kelly, who shoots down her laundry with a Winchester, and Edgar Kennedy, as Wayne's tooth-ache plagued sidekick, add to the general fun. ~ Hans J. Wollstein, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>Dark Skies writer director Scott Stewart has a solid cast, an interesting premise, and some admirable ambitions, but he can't figure out what to do with any of them, and the result is a dull, muddled effort that will bore all but the most devoted horror buffs.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Time and again, Stewart squanders the opportunity to do anything remotely interesting or worthwhile ...</Review>
            <Review>There's little to fear from this rather tame genre outing.</Review>
            <Review>Dark Skies is sort of supernatural, but it's really more super natural....[it's] about the fragility of family, a muted meditation on how precious it is.</Review>
            <Review>Stewart has some lofty ambitions, some of which he almost fulfills.</Review>
            <Review>Those elements are employed with consummate dexterity.</Review>
            <Review>Dark Skies is a bore that even the most forgiving genre buffs will find difficult to defend or endure.</Review>
            <Review>Works perfectly well as a turn-off-the-lights (and be-willing-to-play-along) piece of sci-fi-sprinkled horror amusement.</Review>
            <Review>Sneaks by being a retread, mainly because of the really thick tension and suspense [the director] pulls off with an effective score and sharp direction.</Review>
            <Review>Dark Skies may not be a revelatory experience, but as a pure exercise in genre filmmaking, it excels.</Review>
            <Review>Dark Skies won't totally scratch that itch for a good scare, but it's a welcome treat for those who follow the old X-Files credo, "The truth is out there".</Review>
            <Review>When writer-director Scott Stewart eventually reveals his hand, the film loses its way, but Hamilton and Russell's solidly convincing performances keep things more grounded than you might expect.</Review>
            <Review>Dark Skies unveils its horror slowly, creating a suspenseful ride that feels satisfying even though we're traveling a familiar road.</Review>

            <Review>Sara Rue delivers a charming and funny turn in this otherwise hopelessly formulaic rom-com.</Review>
            <Review>Inoffensive to everyone besides the homeless living on L.A.'s skid row, whom Dorfman shies away from like they're soul-sucking dybbuks</Review>
            <Review>The plotting is like uninspired Mad Libs and the premise so slight it's practically transparent. Nor is there much going on visually, beyond Jay's to-die-for loft.</Review>
            <Review>The sentiments are heartfelt, but the execution is common.</Review>
            <Review>The story is simple and predictable, harmlessly pleasant (except when it tries to be a little edgy; then it's just silly).</Review>
            <Review>Brad Leong's "quirky" romantic comedy retreads ground that is already so well worn, everyone just slides right through.</Review>
            <Review>It would all be rather unbearable without the effervescent personality of Rue, who is as gifted with selling wacky slapstick as she is the romantic drama.</Review>
            <Review>A romantic comedy about the changes that transform a young woman with low self-esteem.</Review>
            <Review>Breezy with a charming performance by Sara Rue, but too sitcomish and shallow to rise above mediocrity.</Review>
            <Review>Forced and unfunny portrait of a Young Woman as a Loser.</Review>
            <Review>Sara Rue is charming as the title character in this generous, slightly fizzy character study of a woman on the verge. The story, however, lets her down.</Review>
            <Review>The film's moral lesson is too contradictory to be taken seriously.</Review>

        <Duration>92</Duration>
        <StoryLine>With Gary Cooper and Barbara Stanwyck in the cast, Blowing Wild was a guaranteed hit even before the cameras began turning. Cooper plays oil wildcatter Jeff Dawson, who does his best to bring in a gusher in Mexico despite continual bandit raids. Dawson asks for help from his ex-employer Ward Conway (Anthony Quinn), but Conway, now married to Dawson's ex-lover Marina (Barbara Stanwyck) refuses, fearing that his wife will want to renew her romance with the other man. The predatory Marina, still in love with Dawson, murders her husband, admits her crime to Jeff, and pleads to be taken back to America with him. A timely bandit attack solves everyone's problems in ultra-violent fashion. Blowing Wild was filmed through the facilities of Mexico City's Churubusco Studios. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <ReleaseDate> 1964</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>116</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Deliberately casting his established screen image to the four winds, Cary Grant plays Walter Eckland, an unkempt, uncouth and unshaven beach bum in Father Goose. During World War II, Walter keeps busy relaying radio reports of Japanese air activity. But he's no hero, and in fact volunteered for this mission only because he's been promised a shipment of liquor by Australian naval officer Frank Houghton (Trevor Howard). Making matters worse for the misanthropic Eckland is the arrival of French schoolmistress Catherine Freneau (Leslie Caron) and her seven little-girl charges, whose plane has crashed nearby. The animosity between Walter and Catherine erupts into a slapping contest, with Walter dishing it out as well as taking it. Only when Catherine is bitten by a deadly snake does Walter express his affections for her. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>A fun lightweight adventure, one of the better Cary Grant films, and a darned good "starter" romantic comedy because of all the other distractions and a world that threatens to tear this couple apart before they can even come together.</Review>
            <Review>Watching Cary Grant shuffle about like an angry, disheveled bum is funny to a degree that it wouldn't be for virtually any other actor who could have conceivably fit the role.</Review>
            <Review>One of Cary Grant's last pictures (he retired 2 years later) is one of his most commercially popular vehicles, with an Oscar-winning script by Peter Stone and Leslie Caron (who's half his age) as love interest.</Review>
            <Review>Though Cary Grant manages to get the most he can from the role, it's not enough to cover up the film's emptiness.</Review>
            <Review>Not up to Grant's stature</Review>
            <Review>Grant cheerfully plays against a lifetime of typecasting in this modestly entertaining romantic comedy sparks of more than one sort fly between [Grant] and [Caron].</Review>
            <Review>Suddenly, it looks like it may be a very long war for Walter.</Review>

        <StoryLine>A rousing chorus of No�l Coward's "Stately Homes of England" is heard as the opening titles of The Grass Is Greener fade into several stock shots of those stately homes. One of these mansions is owned by British earl Victor Rhyall (Cary Grant), who opens his home to American tourists in order to make ends meet. One such tourist is wealthy Texan Charles Delacro (Robert Mitchum), who sets his sights upon Victor's lovely wife, Hilary (Deborah Kerr). In his efforts to win back his wife, Victor presses his former girlfriend Hattie Durant (Jean Simmons) into service. The Grass Is Greener was adapted by Hugh and Margaret Williams from their own stage play. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <ReleaseDate> 2012</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>77</Duration>
        <StoryLine>This Oscar-shortlisted film is the definitive account of the landmark 1967 Supreme Court decision that legalized interracial marriage: Loving v. Virginia. Married in Washington, D.C. on June 2, 1958, Richard Loving and Mildred Jeter returned home to Virginia where their marriage was declared illegal-he was white, and she was black and Native American. Hope Ryden's luminous, newly discovered home movie footage of the Lovings and their feisty young lawyers and rare photography by Grey Villet are stitched together in the debut feature by Full Frame Documentary Film Festival founder Nancy Buirski in a film that takes viewers behind the scenes of a pair of unlikely civil rights pioneers and their real-life love story.</StoryLine>

            <Review>The tone of the film is solemn and pious, which seems almost inevitable when the topic is segregation and racial intolerance. But there are other reasons to watch this film besides feel-good expediency.</Review>
            <Review>Their story is a powerful statement about freedom.</Review>
            <Review>A low-key but moving documentary about two low-key people and their moving struggle.</Review>
            <Review>The film strikes a quiet, contemplative tone that befits its soft-spoken subjects rather than the tumultuous times in which they lived.</Review>
            <Review>The Loving Story is a different kind of 1960s civil rights tale, one that in many ways has a deeper level of warmth.</Review>
            <Review>One of the many virtues of Buirski's film is that it doesn't hit viewers over the head with the parallel between the Lovings' case and the debate over same-sex marriage.</Review>
            <Review>Not to take away from the film's importance, the whole is like Richard Loving, stolid and admirable but not inspiring.</Review>
            <Review>Reason both to be horrified and inspired by what people can accomplish, and a reminder that progress only happens through coordinated and relentless activism.</Review>
            <Review>A riveting documentary about the case that went all the way to the Supreme Court and legalized interracial marriage in 1967.</Review>
            <Review>The film's story of this Supreme Court victory lays out both its legal and moral import, and then turns back to Richard and Mildred Loving's experience.</Review>
            <Review>The verite footage from the time is a real blessing and the documentary's primary cinematic attraction. The rest, though, is occasionally its technical distraction.</Review>
            <Review>Perhaps the strongest aspect of Nancy Buirski's doc is that it allows the Lovings to tell their story in their own words.</Review>

Angie (Camilla Belle) is an artist who was becoming trapped in a life that she didn't want. Taking flight, she found the freedom she craved on the open road, occasionally waitressing when he funds began to run low. She never knew the warmth of a true human connection until she encountered a wise drifter (Andy Garcia), a charming small-town cop (Colin Egglesfield) and his kindhearted yet slightly suspicious sister (Juliette Lewis). Now that Angie has found people who really care about her, she finally starts to understand how it feels to have a home. Could it be that she's finally found a place where she can settle down, or is this merely the first stop on her long journey to self-discovery?</StoryLine>

            <Review>Once Upon a Time in Brooklyn's vision of the Mafia comes filtered through a needlessly complex screenplay, as if the creators felt the need to prove they've seen a few Arnaud Desplechin films alongside Goodfellas.</Review>

        <Duration>92</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Il Grande Duello is the original title of this Italian/French/West German production. The titular duel pits hard-bitten gunslinger Clayton (Lee Van Cleef) against the equally gritty Saxon (Horst Frank). Before this takes place, however, Clayton champions the cause of Newland (Peter O'Brien) a young punk who'd been framed on a murder charge. One of the beauties of the spaghetti western genre is that there were seldom any clearly defined Good or Bad Guys. This helped to keep the audience guessing as to the ultimate outcome of the film, thereby increasing the entertainment value tenfold.</StoryLine>

        <ReleaseDate/>
        <Duration>94</Duration>
        <StoryLine>A charming sociopath's life begins to unravel in this independent drama from Irish filmmaker Terry McMahon. Charlie (Emmett J. Scanlan) is a successful and well-to-do businessman who is attending a weekend-long conference with his wife, three of his best friends and their spouses. What most of them don't know is Charlie's life is a house of cards; his business is falling apart, his investments are going bust, his marriage is on its last legs, he's been having an affair with a friend's wife, and he's using credit cards to fend off his inevitable financial collapse. En route to the conference, Charlie runs over a working-class woman with his car; he decides to let the draw of a card determine if he calls the police or simply moves on, and over the rest of the weekend, he uses a deck of cards to make his choices. As chance takes the place of Charlie's stunted conscience, his actions and statements become increasingly ugly and abusive while his arrogance, his sense of privilege and his contempt for nearly everyone around him become obvious. Writer and director McMahon raised the financing for Charlie Casanova and recruited most of his cast and crew through postings on Facebook, with the filmmaker claiming it was the first feature film conceived and launched though the use of the social networking site. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>The weaponry is so ridiculously bountiful that the movie must be a defense against something. But it's just another lousy action movie. And for more than an hour, it's less than that.</Review>
            <Review>The movie's tongue in cheek humor will buy off most of the target audience. And Arnie? He's indestructible.</Review>
            <Review>Schwarzenegger can still hold the screen, but these days he grinds through his one-liners like a truck driver taking a steep hill ...</Review>
            <Review>The result is diverting enough for a low-expectations Friday night, but the ingredients were in place for something more.</Review>
            <Review>Not the most iconic choice for Schwarzenegger to announce that he's back, but not one that's completely prefab, either.</Review>
            <Review>Just bold enough, brutal enough, and dumb enough to feel like a return to form.</Review>
            <Review>The Last Stand is not a character study. It's not a dramatic masterpiece. It's a slam-bang action flick-and a good one.</Review>
            <Review>It's a film of mythic incompetence, the most uproariously ill-conceived studio picture since Nicolas Cage's "Wicker Man" remake.</Review>

            <Review>A cool, violent, efficient adaptation of the taciturn anti-hero (the creation of Donald E. Westlake, writing as Richard Stark), who's out to restore order in a bloody world in his own bloody way.</Review>
            <Review>For an old-fashioned crime thriller, you need real pros. Mr. Statham is to acting what Taco Bell is to nutrition.</Review>
            <Review>Poster quote: "Parker," a film that's a little better than you'd expect!</Review>
            <Review>Parker's vengeance isn't thrilling, there's a pointlessly developed non-love triangle, even the glam settings look cheap, and the tough-guy exchanges are inexplicably flat.</Review>
            <Review>Hollywood hasn't butchered Parker-which is to say that it has let him remain a butcher.</Review>
            <Review>Randomly in the future you'll come upon it late one night on Starz, watch twenty minutes or so, then change the channel.</Review>
            <Review>A little more energy behind the camera and a different leading lady and Parker could have been something great. As it stands it's a treat for Statham fans only.</Review>
            <Review>As a tasty but un-nourishing rehash, it's not bad.</Review>
            <Review>The movie seems to suffer from a misguided attempt to chase the female demo.</Review>
            <Review>The action flick doesn't do much to wow you, but keeps things exciting.</Review>
            <Review>Calling "Parker" run-of-the-mill insults the pleasures of the potboilers it's trying to emulate. It feels like the product of misfits who broke into a mill shuttered on the edge of town and fired up the machines without understanding how they work.</Review>

            <Review>Ecstasy is to ecstasy what Trainspotting was to heroin. Different times, different drugs, but the Scotland-set story of addiction and redemption is pretty much the same.</Review>
            <Review>Not so much chemical romance as serious downer, it all seems so old.</Review>
            <Review>A drug-fueled landscape impacted by the Thatcher years, characterized by Scottish working class misery and massive unemployment feeding the underground drug economy. And reflecting Welsh's own conflicting personas as cult figure, pariah and antichrist.</Review>
            <Review>Ecstasy attempts to conjure the same sense of insanity, musical muscle, and impish wit, only to stumble repeatedly as it struggles to put on a dazzling sound and light show.</Review>
            <Review>Its fondness for the writer and the drug film genre may be evident; however neither can turn Irvine Welsh's Ecstasy into anything more than an inferior homage.</Review>
            <Review>In the end, ECSTASY wants to have it both ways -- drugs are celebrated at the beginning of the film, and condemned -- or at least the crime connected with them is - by the end.</Review>
            <Review>One gets the feeling this director doesn't think his target audience is all that smart.</Review>
            <Review>A crass and shallow exploration of a potentially interesting topic, which makes for one downer of a cinematic trip.</Review>
            <Review>Only those still clubbing on ecstasy are likely to enjoy this but then they love everything.</Review>
            <Review>Ecstasy proved itself to be resoundingly more soporific than serotonin enhancing.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately disappointing, thanks to some dodgy performances, irritating characters and a hackneyed, seen-it-all-before script that has nothing new to say.</Review>
            <Review>Getting a fix on reality is the challenge in this exploration of truth, lies &amp; ecstasy set in Edinburgh drug &amp; club scene.. captures the claustrophobic essence of the scene it depicts in a world without light</Review>

        <Duration>131</Duration>
        <StoryLine>A history of violence and oppression threatens to engulf the residents of an affluent seaside community in Neighboring Sounds, a thrilling debut from filmmaker Kleber Mendonca Filho. A palpable sense of unease hangs over a single city block in the coastal town of Recife, Brazil. Home to prosperous families and the servants who work for them, the area is ruled by an aging patriarch and his sons. When a private security firm is reluctantly brought in to protect the residents from a recent spate of petty crime, it unleashes the fears, anxieties and resentments of a divided society still haunted by its troubled past. -- (C) Cinema Guild</StoryLine>

            <Review>One of the strongest feature debuts of the last decade ...</Review>
            <Review>The film promises a little more than it delivers, and at over two hours there are moments where it drags. But as a statement of intent, 'Neighbouring Sounds' is incredibly bold.</Review>
            <Review>Economically packed with social issues of wealth, property and class, and deft cinematic references, this is a movie built for the modern global high-rise condo market.</Review>
            <Review>Similar to the slow-creep style of Dogtooth director Giorgos Lanthimos, the narrative unfolds with escalating tension, the cause of which is heard and felt but not always seen.</Review>
            <Review>"Neighboring Sounds" presents itself not only as a character study, but also as an authentic socio-economic class study.</Review>
            <Review>A Brazilian drama with a powerful and enveloping sense of place ...</Review>
            <Review>Rural and urban, property lines and blood feuds, family histories and petty battles . . . in a film that reframes Brazil as a place where blood is thicker and murkier than water, even in homes that seem so clean and white and safe.</Review>
            <Review>Entrancing but vaguely discomfiting.</Review>
            <Review>Empty, anxious and puzzling: Neighboring Sounds has an intriguing tone of half-seen unhappiness that never pays off either in black humour or the terror of modern existence.</Review>
            <Review>It's a remarkable, understated fable about social strata and urban paranoia, although its stretches of plotlessness may push patience at 124 minutes.</Review>
            <Review>With each scene, Kleber Mendonça Filho adds layers of meaning to his characters and the neighbourhood, many that no doubt can only be properly appreciated by Brazilian audiences.</Review>
            <Review>A hugely impressive debut feature from Kleber Mendonça Filho.</Review>

            <Review>It's just fun to watch Pacino, Walken and Arkin work together, very much enjoying the shared experience. Seeing Stand Up Guys is an offer you could easily refuse, but hey, why fight it?</Review>
            <Review>If you don't think Al Pacino still has it in him, this is a welcome chance to be proved wrong.</Review>
            <Review>Is it fun? Sure, some of the time. Is it good? That's a stretch. Does it tap the potential of these three actors? Fuggedaboutit.</Review>
            <Review>The degree to which "Stand Up Guys" succeeds at all is completely dependent on Walken, who elevates everything around him by seemingly doing nothing at all.</Review>
            <Review>At least Pacino and Arkin will always have "Glengarry Glen Ross."</Review>
            <Review>The pace is too slack, the gags too tired and the plot too hackneyed for the film to be more than fitfully engaging for all but die-hard Pacino and Walken fans.</Review>
            <Review>Thanks to Al Pacino, Christopher Walken, and Alan Arkin - mostly just for being charismatic old pros who are fun to hang out with - Stand Up Guys is watchable, occasionally amusing, not altogether insufferable.</Review>
            <Review>A messy script isn't enough to undermine these clever veteran actors, who manage to make the most of the humour, drama and action without ever losing their dignity.</Review>
            <Review>Stand Up Guys probably won't appeal to anyone whose father hasn't got friends of pensionable age.</Review>
            <Review>It's depressing to see the likes of Pacino reduced to making erectile dysfunction jokes, more so when the film labours the gag by having him overdose on Viagra.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2012</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>77</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Gregory Crewdson's riveting photographs are elaborately staged, elegant narratives compressed into a single, albeit large-scale image, many of them taken at twilight, set in small towns of Western Massachusetts or meticulously recreated interior spaces, built on the kind of sound stages associated with big-budget movies. Shapiro's fascinating profile of the acclaimed artist includes stories of his Park Slope childhood (in which he tried to overhear patients of his psychologist father), his summers in the bucolic countryside (which he now imbues with a sense of dread and foreboding), and his encounter with Diane Arbus's work in 1972 at age 10. Novelists Rick Moody and Russell Banks, and fellow photographer Laurie Simmons, comment on the motivation behind their friend's haunting images. -- (C) Zeitgeist</StoryLine>

            <Review>If only "Struck by Lightning" had a sharper, stronger perspective, it might have made more of its conceit.</Review>
            <Review>Except for Ms. Janney's monstrous mother and an Alzheimer's-afflicted grandmother (Polly Bergen), "Struck by Lightning" gives its characters no dimension.</Review>
            <Review>There isn't much to say about Struck by Lightning, except that it's one of those interchangeable teen movies that lands in theaters in early January, the morgue for films nobody knows what to do with.</Review>
            <Review>In his screenwriting debut, Glee's gifted Chris Colfer, 22, proves he can lace a line with sass and soul.</Review>
            <Review>A sincere rather than charming or laugh-out-loud movie-and tonally, one of the latter would have made it work much better. It's also too serious-one wants more outrageousness-because that's what the fun little premise promises but doesn't quite deliver.</Review>
            <Review>This is a highly confused film that doesn't seem to know exactly what it wants to be.</Review>
            <Review>Likeable, frequently funny comedy enlivened by snappy dialogue and strong performances from a superb comic cast, though the overall plot is weak and the opening conceit referenced in the title fails to convey any dramatic or emotional weight.</Review>
            <Review>There are some nice spins on old high school clichés and enough off-center characters and good, occasionally great, dialogue that should make this one of the year's early hits in the art house market.</Review>

            <Review>This fantasy about witches and warlocks walking among us was clearly produced for the Twilight crowd, but a witty script and the enjoyably hammy performances from Emma Thompson and Jeremy Irons broaden its appeal.</Review>

            <Review>A superficial supernatural story that aimlessly seeks to follow in the footsteps of 'Twilight.'</Review>
            <Review>May tap into familiar themes of forbidden love oppression, but it's the unique texture of the world, along with the phenomenal cast surrounding it that makes this the most promising teen supernatural drama yet.</Review>

            <Review>Knoller is wonderful as the emotionally cut-off, yet vulnerable Yossi, who yearns for something more from life, but feels both terror at the prospect and unworthiness to claim it.</Review>
            <Review>Yossi is an early spring breeze of a film - too delicate to be substantial but definitely holding the promise of warmth.</Review>
            <Review>It's serious about its characters and their emotions, but still finds room for humor.</Review>
            <Review>"Yossi" has an air of lightness but never feels insignificant.</Review>
            <Review>Eytan Fox depicts modern gay life and contemporary Tel Aviv with sympathy and knowing insight, and he excels at creating casual rapport among actors; yet in film after film he undermines these gifts with hamfisted melodramatic plotting.</Review>
            <Review>Knoller manages to make even a withdrawn character compelling, and worth rooting for as Yossi struggles to shed his shell.</Review>
            <Review>a very real portrait of a man on the verge of accepting himself</Review>
            <Review>Filled with many of the awkward life moments that many gay men will recognise, as well as a freshly lensed look at the new Israel, Yossi is a strong and touching take on grief.</Review>
            <Review>Yossi is a stronger film than its predecessor, more deeply felt and less reliant on love-story conventions.</Review>
            <Review>... an awfully familiar fantasy-for gays and straights alike-about an emotionally repressed older man saved by a young beauty who sees the kind soul and intelligence under the frumpy surface.</Review>
            <Review>Fox understands that the joys and tears of looking for love are not unique to gay Israeli men...viewers can relate to the emotional conflicts regardless of one's orientation.</Review>

            <Review>Soderbergh is less interested in making statements than he is in skillfully fulfilling genre expectations.</Review>
            <Review>A crafty teaser that presents itself as one kind of film before gradually evolving into another kind altogether. I, for one, enjoyed both enormously.</Review>
            <Review>Steven Soderbergh is one of our best and most versatile directors.</Review>
            <Review>A trimly paced thriller that plays with audience expectations and keeps viewers off-balance.</Review>
            <Review>It is, when the end credits roll, a sold, sturdy little mystery - sleek, and more than a little junk-foody.</Review>
            <Review>The script by Scott Z. Burns is deliciously sinuous.</Review>

        <StoryLine>From ACORN to Weinergate, HATING BREITBART tells the story of one man with a website who forever changed the media paradigm, upending the traditional press and changing the ground rules of political journalism.

In the process, he repeatedly found himself the target of a media feeding frenzy as the old paradigm's supporters pushed back. (c) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>Marcus makes little effort to illuminate Breitbart's character or motivation, so this high-pitched portrait ends up a little flat.</Review>
            <Review>Lacking the objectivity or contextual analysis to more fully examine the important issues it raises, it's a minor chapter in an unfinished story.</Review>
            <Review>This is less a documentary than a wholly uncritical celebration ...</Review>
            <Review>Overall, Hating Breitbart is conspicuously parsimonious when it comes to providing biographical info about its subject.</Review>
            <Review>Docu one-sidedly reveres late right-wing media provocateur.</Review>
            <Review>You have to give Hating Breitbard credit. No other film on the subject would be as slavishly non-objective as this one.</Review>
            <Review>... as far as this film is concerned Andrew Breitbart was a great American, a nearly mythical figure like Daniel Boone. (Who, as members of my generation will remember, also "fought for America, to make all Americans free.")</Review>
            <Review>Perhaps because of its subject's unexpected death, "Hating Breitbart" leaves you wondering how far Breitbart could have taken his crusade for new media to topple the old and take back the power of storytelling.</Review>

        <Title>Nightfall</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 1999</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>70</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Isaac Asimov's classic science fiction story "Nightfall" posited a world bathed in perpetual sunlight because of its six suns, which are all in constant orbit so one is always shining. But once every 2,000 years or so there is an eclipse that throws the plant into darkness and drives people mad. Asimov is after a comparison of religious superstition and scientific knowledge here, centered on the poetic sense of awe evoked when darkness falls and the stars are visible for the first time. The present filmed version loses all the poetry, exacting science, and subtlety of its inspiration and adds instead the wooden, uncommitted acting of David Carradine (Kung Fu) as a scientist, hordes of Indian extras (it seems to have been filmed in Bombay), and some botched pyrotechnic battle sequences. Clearly the filmmakers lost their way from story to screen, opting instead for a Raiders of the Lost Ark feeling, with lots of lame action and adventure usurping the story's core concept. The Asimov story has garnered top honors in poll after poll, including one done by the Science Fiction Writers of America, and the packaging tries to capitalize on that cachet. Understandable, since this movie has nothing else going for it. --Jim Gay</StoryLine>

            <Review>It hits all the expected beats of a thoroughly vanilla biopic as an aging Leonie reflects on her unconventional life via plodding voiceover while doddering through a forest collecting berries.</Review>
            <Review>As a portrait of female strength and a celebration of the artistic spirit, "Leonie" too seldom comes fully alive.</Review>
            <Review>Failing to carve anything graceful or fluid out of a slab of biography, helmer Hisako Matsui does bring to light a curious and intriguing story of a great-woman-behind-a-great-man in Leonie.</Review>
            <Review>Lushly photographed and featuring a stellar performance by the luminous Emily Mortimer in the title role, Hisako Matsui's film is deeply heartfelt but only intermittently compelling.</Review>
            <Review>Leonie Gilmour was almost certainly unusual and unusually self-reliant. Too bad that the film that bears her name ultimately reduces her to the mother of her child.</Review>
            <Review>Color it inspirational.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is more enjoyable when pictures rather than words do the talking. Mortimer is wonderful, but her speeches are less memorable than the simple shots of Japanese flowers, fields and homes that Matsui uses as artistic grout to connect scenes.</Review>
            <Review>Though Leonie is slow at times, it highlights a little-known historical figure in a manner that is emotionally and intellectually satisfying.</Review>
            <Review>Despite some nice period elements, it's a mostly sparkle-free affair, sticking so closely to the genre blueprint as to be generic.</Review>
            <Review>Matsui's Leonie is, very simply, a beautiful film, and one that will live in our hearts and minds long after it ends on screen.</Review>
            <Review>Uneven, but it captures a time, and a woman ahead of her time.</Review>
            <Review>"Love is one of life's most spiritual and beautiful chapters," Mortimer is forced to purr. Later: "It seems I am fated to move wherever it is I seek to build my dream."</Review>

            <Review>Bowler and Lohan never approach the kind of magnetism that a movie about Burton and Taylor must conjure in order to be convincing.</Review>
            <Review>It feels throughout like those behind it made a deliberately campy, dumb, over-the-top and wildly unconvincing film to satisfy the whims of an audience eager to laugh at, rather than with, it.</Review>
            <Review>No matter what you think of the actors, the great period stylings, not to mention Cleopatra-period costumes, make this jewel-encrusted, cocktail-soaked, often tragic saga a rip-roaring good time.</Review>

            <Review>There are intimations throughout that Charlie may not have the strongest grip on reality, though there's nothing ambiguous about the picture's overriding tedium.</Review>
            <Review>This turgid and pretentious thriller is all style, no substance.</Review>
            <Review>The makers of "Tomorrow You're Gone" were definitely going for a specific something with the film. The question is - why?</Review>
            <Review>Tomorrow You're Gone looks like it was made after reading the first chapter of Noir for Dummies.</Review>
            <Review>For some reason, Stephen Dorff has been cast yet again as... anybody.</Review>
            <Review>It's almost as if Jacobson and writer Matthew F. Jones changed their minds at the last minute, leaving us all in the lurch.</Review>
            <Review>Whilst Dorff is fairly blank in the central role, Monaghan is superb, creating a character whose unlikeliness doesn't detract from her believability.</Review>
            <Review>Stephen Dorff struggles to rise above the plainness of the film's premise.</Review>
            <Review>Simmering undercurrents of dread and distrust drive this updated "Bonnie and Clyde" set in the dark inner city.</Review>
            <Review>Assuming a series of increasingly empty noir postures and grimaces, Dorff expedites the plunge into frustrating pointlessness of this curious psychological drama.</Review>
            <Review>Tomorrow You're Gone may be overly confusing from start to finish, but there's no confusion about the fact that it's simply not very good.</Review>
            <Review>Despite its great cast, this murky thriller disappoints because of a lack of cohesiveness and less than stellar production values.</Review>

            <Review>Texas Chainsaw 3D isn't exactly good, but despite its many clichés and generic indulgences, you want to give it some points for trying.</Review>
            <Review>The original "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" leaves audiences feeling hollowed out, dispirited and dissolute. "Texas Chainsaw 3D" is simply a bummer for being a big nothing.</Review>
            <Review>As pointless as one feared it might be.</Review>
            <Review>Alexandra Daddario, playing a distant Leatherface cousin set to inherit the manor (and manner), continues her sad career in unbuttoned bondage, and the 3-D effects are especially ruinous.</Review>
            <Review>All the makers of "Texas Chainsaw 3D" cared about was getting your $16.</Review>
            <Review>Try as [Luessenhop] might to honor the original -- flashbulb transitions, a skeevy (yet buff) hitchhiker, metal doors, and meat hooks -- there's little of its mounting dread.</Review>
            <Review>The trend lately in Hollywood is that the first weekend in January belongs to horror. Unfortunately for us, it's subpar horror.</Review>
            <Review>Characters usually suffer their terrible fates through blatant stupidity.</Review>
            <Review>embarrasses a horror icon</Review>
            <Review>The gore is plentiful, the acting is solid, and Leatherface is a monster once again.</Review>
            <Review>With acting that falls way under the bar, poorly written characters, a ten year gap that everyone ignores, and a pretty laughable storyline, Texas Chainsaw is somewhat watchable thanks to the legacy its built on that it nearly pisses all over.</Review>
            <Review>There's a great deal of potential in the approach. The execution, however, is half-baked and half-assed.</Review>

            <Review>It's refreshing to watch a music doc, especially one with such intimate access to its subject, in which barely anyone is unreservedly polite about the person in question.</Review>
            <Review>Ginger Baker has been revealed as a major talent, an innovator and an unlikely survivor. And a not very nice guy.</Review>
            <Review>Ginger Baker is, and was, a train wreck. Yet this film, like Baker's onstage playing, is always riveting, and something you can't look away from.</Review>
            <Review>"Beware of Mr. Baker" is comprehensive, if somewhat overly glowing.</Review>
            <Review>The takeaway: great musician, deficient family man, taxing friend and bandmate, excellent documentary subject.</Review>
            <Review>This is warts and all, with the emphasis on the warts.</Review>
            <Review>An entertaining doc on the volatile but great jazz and rock drummer, the controversial London born Ginger Baker.</Review>
            <Review>The constantly gripping film is adroitly assembled.</Review>
            <Review>With no preconceptions, I found this to be one of the films of the year - an extraordinary story about an even more astonishing talent.</Review>
            <Review>Bleakly entertaining, Beware of Mr Baker neither eulogises nor patronises its subject; one day (though possibly not soon), Baker may take it upon himself to say thanks.</Review>
            <Review>It's a broadly forgiving portrait of an impossible, irascible talent, who seems to have treated life much like his instrument.</Review>
            <Review>We are always being told that books and movies have to have "sympathetic" lead characters - well, here's a documentary that does very well without one.</Review>

        <Duration>86</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Set in a stylized Los Angeles, 'A GLIMPSE INSIDE THE MIND OF CHARLES SWAN III' is a playful comedy of lost love, friendship, revenge fantasies, and Brandy Alexanders. Charles (Charlie Sheen) is a successful graphic designer whose fame, money and charm have provided him with a seemingly perfect life. When his true love, a perplexing beauty named Ivana, suddenly breaks off their relationship, Charles' life falls apart and he swirls into a downward spiral of doubt, confusion and reflection. With the support of his loyal intimates- Kirby (Jason Schwartzman), Saul (Bill Murray), and his sister, Izzy (Patricia Arquette) -- he begins the hard road of self-evaluation to come to terms with a life without Ivana. The film begs the question: Is it possible to love and hate someone at the same time? (c) A24</StoryLine>

            <Review>This giant turkey was produced, written, and directed by Roman Coppola, who must have thought the dumb fantasy sequences, steeped in movieland imagery, would remind people of 8-1/2 (or, at the very least, Head).</Review>
            <Review>The audience finds out just how long 84 minutes can be. The answer: really long.</Review>
            <Review>Perhaps the best thing that can be said about the film is that it adequately depicts the narcissism of its star ...</Review>
            <Review>A film is a terrible thing to waste.</Review>
            <Review>The execution ... is perilously self-absorbed ...</Review>
            <Review>A movie that doesn't really seem to have any reason to exist, other than maybe to give writer and director Roman Coppola and star Charlie Sheen something to do for a few weeks.</Review>
            <Review>It's rare to witness a film with such a profound disconnect between the director's intention and the final product. It's clear Coppola is striving for some kind of meaningful sublime statement but in reality he has created an interminably vacuous picture.</Review>
            <Review>The what-the-heck-was-that? novelty wears off with astonishing speed once it sinks in that none of this is going anywhere.</Review>
            <Review>Sheen is about as capable of playing a character who isn't Charlie Sheen as he is of playing a dog, or a muffin, or a bottle of shampoo.</Review>
            <Review>a Walter Mitty approach to justify the decadent and pathetic life of Charlie Sheen</Review>
            <Review>A light (and slight) surrealistic comedy of emotional waywardness -- intriguing enough to qualify as a playful lark.</Review>

        <StoryLine>A North Henan landlord embarks on a pilgrimage to Shaanxi province during the 1942 famine, struggling to survive as war with Japan looms on the horizon. His house beset by starving villagers, Landlord Fan (Zhang Guoli) endeavors to calm the crowd by preparing a feast. But his house is burned down in the chaos, prompting Fan, his teenage daughter Xing Xing (Fiona Wang), his servant Shuang Zhu (Zhang Mo), and his tenant Hua Zhi (Xu Fan) on a treacherous journey south. Along the way, encounters with an American journalist (Adrian Brody), a judge (Dan Wei), and a priest (Zhang Hanyu) who has lost his faith reveal the true depth of the despair that grips the country. But the hardships along the way prompt Fan to make some devastating sacrifices that leave him a broken man. Meanwhile, the Japanese government attempts to turn the Chinese people away from their government by offering them sustenance, and the Chinese government finds themselves forced to choose between feeding their troops or the masses. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi</StoryLine>

With a set of master keys allowing him free access to every room in the school, Drake rolls camera on his most ambitious project to date as personalities clash, and the ugly truth about their suffocating social hierarchy slowly comes to light. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <Duration>80</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Director Mark Manning and Iraqi journalist Rana Al-Aiouby give a voice to the people most directly affected by the Iraq War in this documentary filmed shortly after that conflict's largest battle. Only by getting a clear picture of the reality on the ground can the issue be humanized, and as the stories of survivors and the less fortunate play out right before our very eyes, we come to understand that the people who lost their lives in this conflict are not merely statistics, but mothers, fathers, brothers, and sisters, just like the people we hold dearest in our daily lives. A joint production between American ad Iraqi filmmakers, The Road to Fallujah rejects the veneer perpetuated by Western media to highlight the complex realities of the battle of Fallujah. Conversations with Iraqi citizens, resistance fighters, refugees, American soldiers, and proponents of peace such as Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Thich Nhat Hanh, and Arun Gandhi make for a well-rounded discussion about a most controversial war.</StoryLine>

        <ReleaseDate> 2012</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>94</Duration>
        <StoryLine>I Am Bruce Lee tells the amazing story of one of the most iconic human beings ever to enter the public consciousness. Voted as one of the most important people of the 20th century in Time Magazine's Time 100, as well as one of the Greatest Pop Culture Icons by People Magazine, Bruce Lee continues to be honoured and remembered for his enduring legacy. Bruce Lee's often revolutionary and sometimes controversial thinking on a multitude of planes has become a source of inspiration and debate for a generation of philosophers, actors, filmmakers and athletes. The film is a compelling and visually stunning uncovering of Bruce's life, his enormous impact, and his ever-expanding legacy in the world of martial arts, entertainment, and beyond-despite his tragic and sudden death at the age of 32. -- (C) D&amp;E</StoryLine>

            <Review>"I Am Bruce Lee" is a documentary that mostly praises a mighty icon in the world of martial arts. It's a thoughtful repackaging of information we've seen before.</Review>
            <Review>It's safe to say that every inch of Bruce Lee's legacy has been covered and I Am Bruce Lee is just an excessive amount of icing added to an already well decorated cake.</Review>
            <Review>If you want to kick back and bask on Bruce Lee glory for ninety minutes, "I Am Bruce Lee" definitely fits the need.</Review>
            <Review>Its odd agenda rather overshadows some fascinating archive footage and reminiscences from Lee's family.</Review>
            <Review>Features some interesting testimony, useful background material, rarely seen home movie footage and great clips...</Review>
            <Review>Well-researched and essential viewing for Bruce Lee fans.</Review>
            <Review>Martial-arts fans will love this Bruce Lee tribute - cinephiles might be less satisfied.</Review>
            <Review>Baggy, braying and kinda unhelpful, this one is strictly for paid-up Lee lovers.</Review>
            <Review>Watchable documentary that's chiefly notable for its archive footage of the man himself, though it's also all rather one-sided and there's very little here that will be new to Bruce Lee fans.</Review>
            <Review>How does a small Chinese guy become the movies' greatest martial artist of all time? That question drives this reverential documentary about the man with the one-inch punch.</Review>
            <Review>Whether you're a mixed martial arts fan, a kung fu movie junkie or a pop culture enthusiast enthralled by Lee's iconic image, you'll find something in "I Am Bruce Lee" to enjoy.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Argentina, 1979. After years of exile, Juan (12) and his family come back to Argentina under fake identities. Juan's parents and his uncle Beto are members of the Montoneros Organization, which is fighting against the Military Junta that rules the country. Because of their political activities they are being tracked down relentlessly, and the threat of capture and even death is constant. However, Juan's daily life is also full of warmth and humor, and he quickly and easily integrates into his new environment. His friends at school and the girl he has a gigantic crush on, Maria, know him as Ernesto, a name he must not forget, since his family's survival is at stake. Juan accepts this and follows all of his parents' rules until one day he is told that they need to move again immediately, and leave his friends and Maria behind without an explanation. This is a story about militancy, undercover life, and love. The story of a clandestine childhood. (c) Film Movement</StoryLine>

            <Review>Ávila can't quite thread the needle between telling his personal story and connecting it to larger social currents.</Review>
            <Review>'Clandestine Childhood'' is the impressive first feature by Argentine director Benjamín Avila.</Review>
            <Review>When a filmmaker proves as reluctant as Mr. Ávila to speak up about the past, to engage with its full complexity, it can be hard to hear what he's saying.</Review>
            <Review>The calmer scenes are staged in staid and somewhat clunky fashion, but the graphic animation depicting the worst moments is starkly effective.</Review>
            <Review>Outré flourishes don't fully lift the story past the limitations of innocence-lost storytelling.</Review>
            <Review>A charming, involving first feature, Clandestine Childhood muscles its familiar coming-of-age material into something more vibrant and urgent than the usual.</Review>
            <Review>A solemn reverie about an urban guerrilla mother in revolutionary struggle, and the maternal ideal as ambivalent myth and martyr. Giving rise to the contemplation of art as an act of necessity, and the creative journey of the life of an idea in a film.</Review>
            <Review>Benjamín Ávila structures the film as a series of precious moments, remembrances of a difficult year when the politics of patria and family got in the way of his puppy love.</Review>
            <Review>The pic has strong moments, but is bogged down by a script that regurgitates standard-issue ideas without finding anything interesting to say.</Review>
            <Review>As is often the case with directors who adapt their own life-histories, there's the sense that Avila is a little too close to his material.</Review>

            <Review>Finding Nemo is distributed by Disney, and it has what the most heartfelt Disney animated features used to have: rapturous imagery matched with real wit.</Review>
            <Review>The latest flood of wizardry from Pixar, whose productions, from Toy Story onward, have lent an indispensable vigor and wit to the sagging art of mainstream animation.</Review>
            <Review>Finding Nemo is laced with smart humor and clever gags, and buoyed by another cheery story of mismatched buddies: a pair of fish voiced by Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres.</Review>
            <Review>Like Pixar's previous films, Finding Nemo mines humor from the oddities of an unknown world but stays grounded in a familiar one, finding recognizable elements of heartbreak and happiness amid the ink-jetting octopi and irritable flounders.</Review>
            <Review>While Mr. Brooks is very funny, Ms. DeGeneres gives a bravura comic performance, as well as a touching one.</Review>
            <Review>A genuinely funny and touching film that, in less than a decade, has established itself as a timeless classic.</Review>
            <Review>...a good-but-hardly-great animated endeavor from Pixar.</Review>
            <Review>Finding Nemo is ultimately a rewarding, engaging, compelling, and even spiritual adventure that works charismatically on multiple levels.</Review>
            <Review>It looks great, of course: All the Pixar movies do. But the genius of those other movies lay in their actual stories -- stories as inspired as the animation.</Review>
            <Review>Visually, Finding Nemo is spectacular. The animators render theses scenes with exquisite detail and vibrant color, reaching beyond mere CGI-wizardry to artistry.</Review>
            <Review>A beguiling piece of storytelling and creates a magical underwater world through its imaginative graphics and sound effects.</Review>
            <Review>Artistically, it's up there with the all-time animated greats.</Review>

        <Title>The Rabbi's Cat</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2012</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>89</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Based on the best-selling graphic novel by Joann Sfar, The Rabbi's Cat tells the story of a rabbi and his talking cat - a sharp-tongued feline philosopher brimming with scathing humor and a less than pure love for the rabbi's voluptuous teenage daughter. Algeria in the 1930s is an intersection of Jewish, Arab and French culture. A cat belonging to a widowed rabbi and his beautiful daughter, Zlabya, eats the family parrot and miraculously gains the ability to speak. Along with the power of speech comes unparalleled sardonic wit, and the cat - and filmmaker Sfar - spare no group or individual as they skewer faith, tradition and authority in a provocative exploration of (among other things) God, lust, death, phrenology, religious intolerance, interspecies love, and the search for truth. Rich with the colors, textures, flavors and music of Mediterranean Africa, the film embarks on a cross continent adventure from the tiled terraces, fountains, quays and cafes of colonial Algiers to Maghrebi tent camps, dusty trading outposts, and deep blue Saharan nights in search of a lost Ethiopian city.

            <Review>Like the title character, the makers of The Rabbi's Cat follow their noses wherever a new scent leads. Their eternal curiosity buoys this Cat, then impairs it somewhat, but redeems it by the end.</Review>

            <Review>A workmanlike action thriller, competent but never particularly thrilling.</Review>
            <Review>Jack Reacher is an absurdly self-confident, sociopathically laser-focused detective-bot. That is to say, he's a hero that only Tom Cruise could love.</Review>
            <Review>This hard-charging action flick, based on the bestselling series of novels by Lee Child, is a throwback to the tough-nosed crime dramas of the 1960s and 1970s.</Review>
            <Review>It's so forgettable that its rewatchability factor could be off the charts.</Review>
            <Review>Plain, cleanly directed meat-and-potatoes action filmmaking that aspires to competence and simplicity. A nice change of pace.</Review>
            <Review>Usually McQuarrie keeps things light, letting us enjoy the fantasy of one man defending himself against five enemies with nothing but his fists.</Review>
            <Review>Christopher McQuarrie's Jack Reacher is that rare blend of hard-hitting action and smooth-talking dialogue that makes for an entertaining film.</Review>
            <Review>Cruise does his best to keep a straight face and make himself halfway believable as a brainy roughhouser - think of a less intense Jason Bourne - but ridiculous plotting undermines his efforts.</Review>

        <Duration>83</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Barrymore, set in 1942, follows acclaimed American actor John Barrymore (Christopher Plummer), a member of one of Hollywood's most well-known multi-generational theatrical dynasties. No longer a leading box office star, the film finds Barrymore reckoning with the ravages of his life of excess. He has rented a grand, old theatre to rehearse for a backer's audition to raise money for a revival of his 1920 Broadway triumph in Richard III. It leads him to look back on the highs and lows of his stunning career and remarkable life. -- (C) The Film Sales Company</StoryLine>

            <Review>Think of it as one great performer saluting another.</Review>
            <Review>Plummer commands the stage as easily and firmly as Barrymore must have. He makes us believe that Barrymore would indeed, as he tries to reach deep into his past and revive Richard, keep recalling his wives or breaking in to sing a pop song of the day.</Review>
            <Review>The interest is in Plummer himself-who he is, what he can do.</Review>
            <Review>Mr. Plummer stumbles beautifully, poignantly and often, leering and searching through a haze of memory or, with concern edged with panic, calling for 'a line, a line' much as Richard III calls for a horse.</Review>
            <Review>You wish you could be seeing this performance live, as it's meant to be seen - but lacking that, "Barrymore" on the big screen provides its own thrills.</Review>
            <Review>Plummer is marvelous, flitting between reminiscence and Shakespearean recitation as a gifted artist aware of his own wretchedness.</Review>
            <Review>Plummer is phenomenal, but be warned: you really have to like one-person shows in order to enjoy this 84-minute tour de force.</Review>
            <Review>In spite of creating a CGI world around Plummer, much is lost in this translation, making an impressive performance from him seem inert.</Review>
            <Review>As an acting masterclass, it's educational and entertaining.</Review>
            <Review>Christopher Plummer works hard to give us his idea of John Barrymore in this record of a theatrical tour-de-force, which is more dramatically florid than biographically enlightening.</Review>
            <Review>Director Erik Canuel fails to deliver us from the inevitable hermeticism of the material.</Review>
            <Review>Erik Canuel, who directed and adapted the work, employs a host of cinematic techniques to enhance Plummer's spell-binding turn as a crotchety has-been who, in 1942, attempts to revive his career by playing Richard III.</Review>

            <Review>The Oranges displays an air of efficient economy. Nothing is messy, no beat too long, the actors hit their marks.</Review>
            <Review>The Oranges dabbles with transgressive ideas (for a moment it felt like the film was implying that infidelity could be a positive force in everyone's lives) before retreating into stupefyingly predictable and safe rhythms.</Review>
            <Review>Although the film suffers during certain plot developments, the set-up and much of the dialogue ring true in this dramedy.</Review>
            <Review>It's the cast that carries a film like this, offering a strong level of acting gravitas to support a bitingly cynical script about the tawdry happenings in a suburb.</Review>
            <Review>The problem is that there's nothing terribly funny about families and friendships being torn asunder.</Review>
            <Review>The acting almost varnishes the fractured surface, enabling the audience to accept the film as a deeply felt, feelgood family comedy.</Review>

            <Review>Byrd and Jenkins earn the film its critical points, but the screenplay has too many moments that feel network-TV-bland.</Review>
            <Review>There's something sweet about Jonathan Segal's modest high school drama, "Norman," despite the contrivances of its protagonist's predicament and its stacking of the emotional deck.</Review>
            <Review>There's a winning emotional truth in the father-son scenes in this Spokane-shot sleeper, directed with skill and sensitivity by Jonathan Segal.</Review>
            <Review>For first-time screenwriter Wingate and Segal, in only his second feature (2004's "The Last Run), it's impressive work - they never overplay the pity card, opting for insight into the complexities of growing up instead.</Review>
            <Review>The director, Jonathan Segal, skillfully builds on the tension that this situation creates, though he can't quite make Wingate's ending click. Still, Segal is so good with his actors that you may not mind.</Review>
            <Review>Perhaps there was a disjuncture between director Jonathan Segal and screenwriter Talton Wingate, or the two first-timers didn't realize how difficult their movie-world premise makes it to take anything else in the film seriously.</Review>
            <Review>Affecting drama about terminal illness has mature themes.</Review>
            <Review>A small film with nicely etched performances, assembled in a way that is consistently engaging and surprising. How many movies can you say that about?</Review>
            <Review>A disquieting outing with little in the way of honest payoff.</Review>
            <Review>A would-be dark, self-congratulatory dramedy that lacks both transgressive laughter and honest engagement with its themes of death and teen depression.</Review>
            <Review>The trapped animal look in Norman's eyes feels more and more like an appropriate reaction.</Review>
            <Review>For me, Richard Jenkins is the heart of "Norman." How often I've admired him; even in unworthy roles, he has such strength, he never seems the need to try.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2012</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>75</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Madelyn Reid (Academy Award winner Marcia Gay Harden) accidentally learns of her husband's infidelity when she saves his sexy young mistress (Talk to Her's Leonor Watling) from a bungled suicide attempt. When her unsuspecting young rival suggests the two new "best friends" take each other's advice - on everything - Madelyn sees an opportunity to seize the upper hand. But the plan backfires when Lucy, an aspiring actress, insists Madelyn keep her end of the bargain - and orders her to star as King Lear in a very amateur production, with Lucy playing The Fool. Things really get out of control when Lucy starts giving Madelyn instructions on dealing with an amorous coworker and a handsome stranger (the ever delectable Aidan Quinn). Marcia Gay Harden gives a hilarious, touching and utterly believable performance in this delightful comedy about two women who become the unlikeliest of friends. With pitch-perfect chemistry between odd couple Harden and Watling, a fine supporting cast, plenty of laughs, and a few pearls of wisdom, If I Were You is a very entertaining look at the unexpected places that life can take us.(c) Kino Lorber</StoryLine>

            <Review>"If I Were You'' has more than its share of laughs, but director Joan Carr-Wiggin needed to cut half an hour to make this fly without interest flagging.</Review>
            <Review>Harden is a wonderful actress but struggles to find the complexity in so strained a situation.</Review>
            <Review>Buried in the bloat of Joan Carr-Wiggin's interminable "If I Were You" are the seeds of what might have been a lean, snappy farce about duplicitous, adulterous games.</Review>
            <Review>Bloody awful.</Review>
            <Review>The people responsible for a hapless load of bunk called If I Were You can only be described as delusional. They think they have made an actual movie, when nothing in it qualifies.</Review>
            <Review>An odd little duck of a film [that] kicks around enjoyably for a while in the same sandbox as some of Woody Allen's mid-career farces, before eventually pivoting and skipping off into less rewarding territory.</Review>
            <Review>A strangled endeavor that's 30 minutes too long and short-sheeted in the laugh department. Perhaps it was a blast to make, but to sit through the feature requires an extraordinary amount of patience.</Review>
            <Review>A screwball comedy for Canadians-not LOL funny, but as crazy as you might expect Toronto to get.</Review>
            <Review>The film's comic sense (exemplified by a drunken Harden acting inappropriately) is slack and its dramatic conclusion unfulfilling.</Review>
            <Review>If anything, that Harden shines in such a problematic starring role only reaffirms her stature.</Review>

        <Title>Mighty Fine</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2012</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>79</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Set in the 1970s, Mighty Fine is the story of Joe Fine, a charismatic, high-spirited man, who relocates his family-wife Stella, daughters Nathalie and Maddie - from Brooklyn to New Orleans, in search of a better life. Joe's devotion to his family knows no bounds, and he seeks to provide them with the ultimate in the good life, from a palatial home to a steady string of extravagant gifts. Unfortunately, Joe's spending spree is wildly out of touch with reality, as his apparel business is teetering on the brink of collapse, a fact he refuses to accept. Mighty Fine ultimately shows how coming to terms with the past without judgment is the most fruitful way to move toward the future. -- (C) Adopt Films</StoryLine>

            <Review>A well-meaning but unstable hand at the tiller, and a propensity for charting plot points, rather than a clear narrative destination.</Review>
            <Review>If you can overlook Andie MacDowell's Mitteleuropa accent as a Jewish Holocaust survivor (I know: big if), the cinematic roman a clef "Mighty Fine" has some quiet charms.</Review>
            <Review>"Mighty Fine," unfortunately, isn't.</Review>
            <Review>Mighty Fine is an incisive portrait of an insecure, manic-depressive tyrant that Mr. Palminteri makes entirely believable.</Review>
            <Review>Too many directions can be as much of a liability for a movie as too few, and "Mighty Fine" heads in all of them.</Review>
            <Review>Director Debbie Goodstein-Rosenfeld wraps so much narrative string around this slight ball it unravels messily, despite nice work from the reliable Palminteri.</Review>
            <Review>A somewhat drab and unimaginative telling further dents this dull melodrama of already rather limited psychological insights, and pat conclusions and catharses.</Review>
            <Review>We're left with something akin to a Lifetime movie, as there are a number of interesting possibilities, which could have added complexity and depth to the film, that are never fleshed out.</Review>
            <Review>Mighty bad.</Review>
            <Review>Debbie Goodstein-Rosenfeld's film seems oddly anemic when it deals with anyone but Chazz Palminteri's Joe.</Review>
            <Review>A semi-autobiographical story of a man's over-reaching, which leads him to consider violent options in dealing with himself and his family.</Review>
            <Review>Hard to imagine how a movie can manage to be so underdeveloped yet so depressing at the same time, but "Mighty Fine" manages to pull it off.</Review>

            <Review>Baker effectively juxtaposes two vastly different worlds, though he never makes the case that either is as significant as the gauzy visuals suggest.</Review>
            <Review>This is confident, engrossing storytelling, and the actors are terrific.</Review>
            <Review>Starlet sneaks up on you.</Review>
            <Review>Where it counts, "Starlet" ... allows its characters room to maneuver within the potential cliches.</Review>
            <Review>The film itself deserves praise for its portraits of these two women and the different worlds they inhabit.</Review>
            <Review>The plotline is unpromising - young porn actress befriends crotchety old lady - and the setup is underwhelming. But stick with "Starlet," and you'll reap unexpected rewards.</Review>
            <Review>...has a sunny SoCal vibe that belies its tawdry milieu</Review>
            <Review>Their friendship goes nowhere you might expect - Sadie doesn't teach Jane any hard-won life lessons, and Jane doesn't try to rekindle Sadie's lost youth. There are no montages here.</Review>
            <Review>Either avoids or transcends nearly every cliché we've come to associate with American independent film.</Review>
            <Review>No amount of strong acting, however, can entirely compensate for the dramatic conveniences or every shrill appearance by Jane's cartoonishly despicable roommates.</Review>
            <Review>"Starlet" is achingly sad, shrewdly funny, and shockingly honest.</Review>
            <Review>Fresh, though, is Baker's nonjudgmental approach. Much like its characters, Starlet simply drifts around the Valley, dividing itself from morality and watching guarded souls interact.</Review>
