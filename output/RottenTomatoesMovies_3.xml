            <Review>Like Godard's "Breathless" and Wong's "As Tears Go By," "Rebels" cunningly synthesizes both B-movie and art film.</Review>
            <Review>A breathtaking, disturbing look at urban angst and the emptiness of youth culture ...</Review>
            <Review>It seems so fresh and immediate you'd never know that it's 23 years old.</Review>
            <Review>A clinical, cool-suspicious dissection of disaffected youth maneuvering Taipei's grimier, noisier corners.</Review>
            <Review>[Rebels of the Neon God] is the director's most accessible film. That will seem like a funny observation once you've seen it, because Tsai's most accessible film is more unusual and uncompromising than any you're likely to see this year.</Review>
            <Review>Not to suggest that cigarette smoking or petty crime is cool, but is it possible to have a cooler entrance than that of Ah Tze and Ah Bing, first seen robbing a blue-lit phone booth on a rainy night in Taipei, cigarettes dangling from their lips?</Review>
            <Review>More than just watching an early film by an untouchable master; it allows you to see his style with newly fresh eyes.</Review>
            <Review>For fans of arthouse cinema, it's easily the most interesting thing to come along in some time.</Review>
            <Review>One of the great films about modern unrest and the pangs of youth. I can't wait to watch it again.</Review>
            <Review>Rebels of the Neon God still brims with the panache of someone still figuring himself out...</Review>
            <Review>Journeying through the grittier side of Taipei -- through musty love hotels, tenements, and street markets -- the film revels in the unabashedly grime-filled beauty of the city and basks itself in melancholy.</Review>

            <Review>It's a concept that's more often the basis of arrested development comedies about late bloomers who finally come into their own, but there's nothing funny about how the past looms over the adults that Gordo and Simon have become.</Review>
            <Review>The Gift chillingly illustrates what happens when fate reunites a class bully (Jason Bateman) with his prize victim, Gordo (Edgerton).</Review>
            <Review>Clever and atmospheric, the film has enough twists to keep the average viewer guessing.</Review>
            <Review>Officially, this is a blank-from-hell movie. But Edgerton has remixed the formula.</Review>
            <Review>The Gift starts out like so many other thrillers before it - with an attractive, well-to-do couple purchasing a big new house - and then beats its own, uniquely tense and twisted path from there.</Review>
            <Review>Just when we think we know where The Gift is going, we're surprised. And then surprised again.</Review>
            <Review>It concludes with one of the most repugnant turns this side of a '60s-era exploitation "roughie," a "twist" so vile it pretty much cancels out the considerable skill and accomplishment of what's preceded it.</Review>
            <Review>The third act of "The Gift" is so gross, so exploitative that it's a wonder it made it from page to screen uncontested.</Review>
            <Review>[The movie] twists an awkward encounter with an old high-school acquaintance into a cracking psychological thriller that offers some genuine surprises.</Review>
            <Review>Joel Edgerton has enogh smarts and directorial instinct so as not to bet everything on the screenplay's ingenuity. The film's strong spatial notion is proof of this. [Full Review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Anchored by a few strong performances and an intriguing central story, The Gift is certainly not without a fault, but it's got enough about it to leave it lingering in your mind after the credits roll.</Review>
            <Review>A film that shows us a potential great filmmaker that watches every detail in order to surprise you. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>

Larry (Jason Schwartzman) is an unqualified, unemployable, inebriated prankster who rides a tide of booze onto the glorious shores of an undiscriminating Quick-Lube.

            <Review>The film never allows the audience to truly get to know any of the characters in Larry's world, a world in which their uniform shirts emblazoned with company logos and their first names serve as reminders of their lot in life.</Review>
            <Review>By widening his soulful puppy eyes - matched only, quite eerily, by those of his French bulldog in real life, Arrow - Schwartzman successfully dares audiences to care.</Review>
            <Review>Schwartzman ... gives Larry enough humanity and a modicum of personal growth that you keep coming back for more.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director Bob Byington showed potential as a social satirist with his provocative 2008 indie RSO (Registered Sex Offender), but this slacker comedy lacks any such venom.</Review>
            <Review>7 Chinese Brothers is so slight it risks evaporating on contact.</Review>
            <Review>The sharpest moments cast mundane struggles in a nearly spiritual light.</Review>
            <Review>7 Chinese Brothers has an abundance of half-hearted slacker charm that it is hard to fault.</Review>
            <Review>"7 Chinese Brothers," modest and unassuming, wins us over too, even though I can't figure out what the R.E.M. song has to do with the movie. Plus, it looks like Byington could only afford 2 Chinese brothers at most.</Review>
            <Review>It's a small film, with some great performances and one irrefutably cute dog.</Review>
            <Review>With 7 Chinese Brothers, Austin-based filmmaker Bob Byington has made his most accessible film yet.</Review>
            <Review>The project is more of a sketchy workshop than a fleshed-out feature, but at least Schwartzman's freewheeling banter provides some modest amusement.</Review>
            <Review>Byington's words elucubrated by Schwartzman's rich varieties of mutter and mumble and banter are one of the genuine moviegoing treasures of a not-completely-half-bad year for emphatically idiosyncratic comedy. I laughed. A lot.</Review>

        <Title>Sunset Edge</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2015</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>87</Duration>
        <StoryLine>On a lazy afternoon, two tales intertwine in this meditative portrayal of disaffected youth set in a graveyard of abandoned mobile homes known as Sunset Edge. Four suburban teens rummage through the decay completely unaware of the shadowy figure that moves among them - a tormented soul with a horrific past. Day turns to night and people disappear as the secrets of Sunset Edge are revealed in a haunting finale. Part gothic thriller, part coming-of-age tale, SUNSET EDGE is a Hitchcockian mash-up that upends teenage horror films. Shot entirely on location in North Carolina, the director's Southern roots are the inspiration for the film. In setting his story amidst the rural decay of this pastoral landscape, Peddle captures a poignant snapshot of American culture. He manipulates time and linearity to create a gripping, layered story. Using only available natural light, he doesn't rely on special effects or gore to enhance the drama or tension. The sparse dialogue gives his characters a natural quality, permitting the audience the vantage point of unseen observer. (C) Cavu</StoryLine>

            <Review>Sunset Edge has a visually poetic quality that goes a long way towards compensating for its opaquely nonlinear, barely there narrative.</Review>
            <Review>An unusual, ambitious failure, mostly because the film's hyper-naturalistic style is meant to evoke a supernatural mood.</Review>
            <Review>Full of striking images but badly overestimates the entertainment value of abandoned trailer parks for the average moviegoer.</Review>
            <Review>A densely atmospheric portrait of disaffected youth by artist-filmmaker Daniel Peddle that flouts preconceived notions at every unconventional turn.</Review>
            <Review>As uninterested in examining its chosen milieu as it is in fashioning anything approaching an engaging narrative.</Review>
            <Review>The one thing that's lacking? A payoff. [But] director Daniel Peddle gets great performances from his non-professional cast and expertly builds a taut and disturbing atmosphere.</Review>
            <Review>This resolutely lo-fi and hauntingly lovely movie . . . ventures instead into the hypnagogic minimalist territory of other beautiful head-scratchers like Last Year at Marienbad or Picnic at Hanging Rock.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is being pushed by its makers as "Hitchcockian," but that's hardly the case. If anything, the film's natural look, isolated setting and supernaturally tinged tale bring to mind The Blair Witch Project far more than any Hitchcock endeavor.</Review>
            <Review>The first fiction feature by writer-director Daniel Peddle casts a slow, somber spell.</Review>
            <Review>A bounty of bucolic rural imagery, skateboard meanderings and bristles of crunchy sound design heighten its shambling assemblage of familiar teen coming-of-age details, lightly suggestive horror imagery and intermittent visual lyricism.</Review>

            <Review>An intriguing, if somewhat lo-fi, indie thriller.</Review>

            <Review>In terms of plot and motivation ... an illogical mess that no amount of carefully moody cinematography can save.</Review>
            <Review>Performances keep the tension building toward an incendiary climax.</Review>
            <Review>It's a minor story with minor ambitions, yet it manages to deliver a fully satisfying and moving experience.</Review>
            <Review>In Tony Ayres' Cut Snake, the true blue Aussie crime flick gets a queer coat of paint. It masks itself as a standard crime flick, but subverts what we have come to expect from these films...</Review>
            <Review>A tough little crime drama full of muted anger, growled dialogue and whispered threats...Much as we applaud the achievements of filmmakers working on small budgets, you can't hand out free passes when those limitations hobble the flow and feel of a film.</Review>
            <Review>An inconsistent film covering too much familiar ground, Cut Snake often gets distracted by the need to service an admittedly striking (though largely pointless) 1970s production design.</Review>
            <Review>It's a big movie, despite its small circle of characters, and rewarding for adventurous viewers.</Review>
            <Review>Artfully shot by Simon Ford, with fine period detail from production designer, Josephine Ford, Cut Snake is technically top-notch, and emotionally uncompromising, as Ayres again strides into largely virgin territory for Australian cinema.</Review>
            <Review>Perhaps the low-ish budget shows here and there, but Ayres' filming of Blake Ayshford's script has a fittingly lived-in '70s look, a cool soundtrack, strong work from the leads (and the supporting cast) and, at times, a sense of real foreboding.</Review>
            <Review>Performances are uniformly impressive, with Stapleton guaranteed a place in the pantheon of creepily charismatic Australian screen criminals.</Review>
            <Review>A young crim out of jail, trying to go straight... hardly an original concept, but Blake Ayshford's screenplay gives it a novel twist and extra layers, while director Tony Ayres pushes for an edgy delivery</Review>
            <Review>Is wasting a great idea better than having none at all? It's up for debate in Cut Snake, where one smart spin on crime caper conventions just isn't enough.</Review>

        <StoryLine>The documentary film Back in Time is, at its heart, a look at the very real impact the Back to the Future movies have had on our culture. What was once a little idea that spawned a tightly-focused documentary has grown into something truly amazing over two years of filming. Back in Time is a cinematic monument to the vastness of the trilogy's fandom. In addition to the footage and interviews revolving around the time machine itself, the crew found that simply by delving into the impact of the trilogy an epic journey began to unfold before them.</StoryLine>

        <ReleaseDate> 2012</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>110</Duration>
        <StoryLine>The sea is forgotten until disaster strikes. But perhaps the biggest seagoing disaster is the global supply chain, which - maybe in a more fundamental way than financial speculation- leads the world economy to the abyss. The film follows container cargo aboard ships, barges, trains and trucks, listening to workers, engineers, planners, politicians, and those marginalized by the global transport system. We visit displaced farmers and villagers in Holland and Belgium, underpaid truck drivers in Los Angeles, seafarers aboard mega-ships shuttling between Asia and Europe, and factory workers in China, whose low wages are the fragile key to the whole puzzle. And in Bilbao, we discover the most sophisticated expression of the belief that the maritime economy, and the sea itself, is somehow obsolete. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>Somehow, Vikander sells it all, not with braying and big gestures, but with vulnerability, sincerity and the sort of ethereal realness that can't be quantified. More, please, more.</Review>
            <Review>Though the movie at times feels oddly unfinished (you wonder what Miranda Richardson, in a tiny role as an Oxford professor, is there for), it's artful and moving.</Review>
            <Review>As a story, it evokes a word that no battlefield nurse would ever apply to her experiences: sterile.</Review>
            <Review>Testament of Youth isn't a typical biopic; it's a heartfelt manual on forging ahead.</Review>
            <Review>In what is a well-acted but fairly typical prestige period drama, it's Vikander's nuanced performance as the resolute but still-vulnerable Vera who gives the film its depth.</Review>
            <Review>This is Vikander's film and she is very good here.</Review>
            <Review>Nimbly tip toes around potential schmaltz, but still delivers the expected quota of emotion.</Review>
            <Review>An exquisite piece of work that shimmers with authentic emotion.</Review>
            <Review>It's very nicely, if a little safely made, and gives you a compelling sense of how blithely an entire generation was squandered.</Review>
            <Review>The actors are all extremely fine, with special credit extending not just to Vikander but to Colin Morgan in wonderfully open-hearted form as a fellow member of an all-but-lost generation.</Review>
            <Review>As this is a film about a witness bearer, it does well to capitalize on Vikander's perpetually observant eyes, which convey tenderness, intelligence, shock, incomprehension, comprehension, resiliency, and finally wisdom.</Review>
            <Review>This incredibly emotional film looks at one young woman who saw both her brother and fiancé volunteer to fight in the trenches.</Review>

            <Review>Paper Towns is particularly good at pinpointing that certain point in teenage male friendships where the guys are getting older, but they still sometimes resort to silly voices and goofy humor when the girls aren't around.</Review>
            <Review>Paper Towns is too nice. And that is, coincidentally, also the problem its hero has been facing.</Review>
            <Review>This is sensitive and often winning in its depiction of adolescent behavior; the characters speak openly about their vulnerabilities, which makes them sympathetic.</Review>
            <Review>Paper Towns is an exercise in artifice.</Review>
            <Review>Paper Towns is a movie that I really liked, but I probably would have loved if I'd seen it when I was 13.</Review>
            <Review>It's the rare movie that can sacrifice the clean lines of fantasy and melodrama for the messiness of ordinary life - that neither burnishes nor condemns the up-down turmoil of the teenage soul, but rather lets it be.</Review>
            <Review>I like everything about Paper Towns except for its premise and central romance. Yes, I know those sort of seem like dealbreakers, but the things I liked about Paper Towns marginally outweighed the things I didn't like. Marginally.</Review>
            <Review>Ferris Bueller said it best: 'Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.' 'Paper Towns' reminds us not to miss our life.</Review>
            <Review>'Paper Towns' may well be the Manic Pixie Dream Girl's nadir.</Review>
            <Review>Overall, Paper Towns is a good and solid, if somewhat lengthy, film. The film is structurally and visually conventional with the odd glimmer of indie quirk.</Review>
            <Review>Destined to play second banana to last year's critical and commercial darling "The Fault In Our Stars." But as second bananas go, it's not a bad one.</Review>
            <Review>A smart script peppered with genuinely witty dialogue and some nuanced acting by a young ensemble cast at least keep this coming-of-age story watchable throughout.</Review>

            <Review>It's enormously entertaining, thanks to the undeniable charisma of Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and the wanton CGI destruction of all of the West Coast's greatest landmarks (in 3-D, no less).</Review>
            <Review>Summer's upon us, and you could do worse than watch the undeniably appealing Johnson try to save the day while uttering the silliest dialogue imaginable.</Review>
            <Review>This movie didn't take much time escalating from realistic depiction of a disaster to giant, numbing CGI spectacle.</Review>
            <Review>My resistance to summer blockbusters crumbled like a collapsing skyscraper in the face of this big, loud, exuberantly destructive movie.</Review>
            <Review>Campy but never campy enough and far too numbingly artificial to ever drum up any real suspense or sense of awe, the film has a scale that's squandered on visual witlessness.</Review>
            <Review>The allure of San Andreas rests entirely on the calibre of its pandemonium, savored, ideally, with a brawling audience on a Friday night.</Review>
            <Review>San Andreas turns horror on an unimaginable scale into light entertainment. Pass the popcorn!</Review>
            <Review>All the moving parts are expertly juggled by director Brad Peyton and, yes, the special effects are impressive. But the disaster stuff is laid on way too thick.</Review>
            <Review>Maybe, if this film has any purpose at all, it's to make us stop for a moment and think about the reality.</Review>
            <Review>Empty, cynical destruction porn that's twice as dumb as it should be and not half as enjoyable.</Review>
            <Review>San Andreas typifies the modern Hollywood disaster movie - for better and for worse. The visuals are quite something, but it's all a bit hollow and there's little satisfaction in its conclusions.</Review>
            <Review>It's an unintentionally comedic look at mankind's selfish disinterest toward anyone in danger -- except for family.</Review>

            <Review>Whimsical, mysterious and subtly tragic ...</Review>
            <Review>Agreeable this film certainly is, but the shagginess never seems to take shape.</Review>
            <Review>Even if Güeros doesn't entirely work, it feels worthy: a film made independently and without interference whose reverence for the past thankfully doesn't result in too much solemnity or seriousness.</Review>
            <Review>More than perhaps any other country, Mexico has lobbed some real cinematic intelligence onto the world stage in recent years. "Güeros" continues that salutary tradition.</Review>
            <Review>With the Mexican student strike of 99 as a backdrop and the use of black and white photography and playful camerawork, Güeros is a fresh and interesting film that must be seen. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Güeros is not a perfect film, but it has freshness and honesty, it's ingenious and sensitive, and just for that it's worth seeing it. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>

            <Review>The characters are all paper-thin, but that doesn't matter because their sole purpose is to get chomped.</Review>
            <Review>So basically, Jurassic World is a big-budget indictment of corporate greed, jammed with product placement for Samsung and Mercedes-Benz and Beats by Dre and Coca-Cola.</Review>
            <Review>There is plenty here to divert, but little to leave you enraptored. Such is the fate of the sequel: Bigger. Louder. Fewer teeth.</Review>
            <Review>If you limit your expectations for Jurassic World to "more teeth," it will deliver on that promise. If you dare to hope for anything more-relatable characters, narrative coherence-you'll only set yourself up for disappointment.</Review>
            <Review>Trevorrow is having fun taking as little of this as seriously as he needs to.</Review>
            <Review>You don't go to the fourth Jurassic Park movie for up-to-date gender politics. You go for the crunchy dino-on-human action, and Jurassic World provides plenty of that.</Review>
            <Review>Messy nostalgia trip could bring back turtleneck sweaters.</Review>
            <Review>The whole thing is an elaborate fantasy, so it seems a bit churlish to say, "that's not believable!" But even a film like this needs some internal logic.</Review>
            <Review>As is the vogue among the current generation of blockbusters, it feels like the entire point here is to evoke memories of older, better movies. By those admittedly narrow standards, Jurassic World constitutes a roaring, stomping triumph.</Review>
            <Review>Die-hard fans insist no new 'Jurassic' movie could ever touch the original. Oh yeah? Come again? 'Jurassic World' just completely blew the doors off 'Jurassic Park.'</Review>
            <Review>For long periods, to be fair, Jurassic World is easy to watch and pretty entertaining, especially when Chris Pratt is on the screen.</Review>
            <Review>Narratively continuous to the original film but slightly disregarding its two sequels, Jurassic World is a spectacular rush of furious energy, spellbinding awe and alarming terror from beginning to end.</Review>

            <Review>Z for Zachariah has the tasteful dullness of a movie too afraid to make a choice in any direction.</Review>
            <Review>Zobel and Modi have crafted a thoughtful narrative about the experience of navigating and attempting to accommodate others' personalities.</Review>
            <Review>"Z for Zachariah" is ultimately too dramatically slight and brief for its ambitions, despite its sometimes labored myth-making script and visuals.</Review>
            <Review>The drama brims with religious allusion and questions of how faith manifests in a world without hope.</Review>
            <Review>An intriguing set-up yields a disappointingly ponderous payoff in Craig Zobel's post-apocalyptic drama, "Z for Zachariah."</Review>
            <Review>The deviations from O'Brien's plot don't always work, but the characters do come across as real people, in a believably fallen world, following a carefully planned-out path and trying to avoid a fatal misstep.</Review>
            <Review>It's well acted and beautifully shot and the storytelling restraint of director Craig Zobel allows us to fill in the gaps with our own observations and interpretations of the tensions.</Review>
            <Review>The film is far from what could've been, but the things it does right are enough to get you interested. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Margot Robbie's the only reason to see this film. She's an Australian Emma Stone, with a wide comedic/dramatic range, and charisma for days. She's going to be around a while.</Review>
            <Review>'Z for Zachariah' is a film of ideas, but those ideas never overpower the people it's about.</Review>

            <Review>Everything about The Wolfpack is extraordinary, beginning with the subjects of Crystal Moselle's mesmerizing documentary.</Review>
            <Review>The boys are bright and funny, and when they do go out together - shades on, long hair flowing down rail-thin bodies - they look like a somewhat awkward but cool rock band you'd like to get to know. Moselle's documentary is the next best thing.</Review>
            <Review>Whether they are dancing exuberantly to the cheesy 1980s pop hit Tarzan Boy or celebrating Halloween in their tiny living room, these kids figured out how to not only survive, but thrive. Sometimes, with a little luck and a lot of love, joy finds a way.</Review>
            <Review>It all adds up to a story of the human spirit's ability to survive and even thrive despite twisted circumstance.</Review>
            <Review>It's stunning (and amazingly well done) and hard to believe. Yet it's all true, as far as we know.</Review>
            <Review>Undeniably fascinating.</Review>
            <Review>[A] moving, troubling saga.</Review>
            <Review>A documentary that goes beyond the old stranger-than-fiction cliché into the realm of the genuinely perplexing.</Review>
            <Review>As a modern update on Grey Gardens with an added tribute to the love for filmmaking, The Wolfpack is an endlessly fascinating documentary, but it's not quite a great one.</Review>
            <Review>It's the brothers' singular sibling bond that comes across most vividly as they channel their joyful creativity and exuberance into their home movies.</Review>
            <Review>What would happen if you raised seven children in isolation from the rest of society with only movies to show them what the rest of the world is like? This movie gives some answers to that question.</Review>
            <Review>As if to air out any whiff of freakshow exploitation, Moselle tends to observe and not to impose. She's touchingly receptive to the boys' stories, and evidently aware that in her presentation they can become indistinguishable</Review>

            <Review>The film from director Mark Neveldine is so over the top that one can't help but imagine how the Wayans brothers might lampoon it, then embarrassingly recall them doing exactly so in "A Haunted House."</Review>
            <Review>Whose idea of a fun time is this?</Review>
            <Review>Mark Neveldine's first solo directorial effort is a silly, shrieky and eminently watchable exorcism thriller.</Review>
            <Review>The director Mark Neveldine deploys queasy lighting and a trembling score, but his best choice is to let Ms. Dudley stare at us. She conveys unnerving shifts in self-awareness and sinister intent with her eyes.</Review>
            <Review>It's been a few weeks since the last found-footage demonic-possession chiller, so it must be time for another.</Review>
            <Review>It's the rote B-movie that Neveldine up to now has tried so hard not to make.</Review>
            <Review>The Vatican Tapes - a generic and uncreative horror entry that fails to inspire, move or frighten.</Review>
            <Review>We couldn't expect more from Mark Neveldines debut. [Full Review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>It may be nothing new, bar a few moments of in-your-face ridiculousness, but The Vatican Tapes is a pretty decent addition to the ever-growing list of exorcism films.</Review>
            <Review>this hodgepodge of exorcism and possession clichés... flirt[s] uncomfortably with justifying clerical abuses as just a part of the Church's endless battle against Satan.</Review>
            <Review>With its above-average cast and a gritty, realistic tone, this exorcism thriller is a lot more involving than most.</Review>
            <Review>A routine regurgitation of demonology's familiar myths and legends: needless to say, possession is nine tenths of the lore.</Review>

        <Duration>77</Duration>
        <StoryLine>A perfect storm is brewing as agriculture pioneer Cary Fowler races against time to protect the future of our food. Gene banks of the world are crumbling, crop failures are producing starvation inspired rioting, and the accelerating effects of climate change are already affecting farmers globally. But Fowler's journey, and our own, is just beginning. From Rome to Russia and, finally, a remote island under the Arctic Circle, his passionate and personal journey may hold the key to saving the one resource we cannot live without: our seeds.

            <Review>Although it may not be the most vivid or exciting subject for cinematic exploration, the documentary "Seeds of Time" offers a vital, clear-headed look at the effects of climate change on global food security.</Review>
            <Review>The urgency of expanding the world's seed portfolio is made eminently clear, but the film falters at explaining how these preventive efforts would translate into an impact on a grand scale.</Review>
            <Review>McLeod stitches together these overlapping strands with skill, if not much flair.</Review>
            <Review>[An] accessible and handsome film.</Review>
            <Review>Seeds Of Time neatly utilizes stunning nature photography, zippy animation, map-centric graphics, and stock footage to further clarify its subject matter.</Review>
            <Review>First-person accounts from individuals most affected by the drop in agricultural productivity are rarely the focus of the film's vision.</Review>

        <StoryLine>November 17, 1988, is a day of mourning for some...and for others, a lucrative opportunity. On that date, eight university students were found murdered in the old arts building at the college. An anonymous source told police the 20-somethings were in the midst of a local role-playing game, called Chill. The name of the game is to stay alive. But for the players that November evening, few would be getting up for another round. But when a scheming student decides to profit from the tragedy and revive the whodunit game as a web series, the new players soon discover, for some, this game is still all too real...</StoryLine>

            <Review>A forgettable addition to the proud British tradition of haunted-country-pile movies.</Review>
            <Review>A standard haunted house set-up, only with strong acting, handsome cinematography, and an old-fashioned sense of crafty restraint.</Review>
            <Review>When so many horrors never stray from the usual route, it's laudable that Blackwood takes a detour somewhere unexpected.</Review>
            <Review>So trad it could have been made in the 60s, Blackwood nevertheless has the courage of its old-school convictions.</Review>
            <Review>The film-makers create a genuinely unsettling atmosphere and crank up the tension in effective fashion... Unfortunately, in the final reel, the film lurches into Grand Guignol silliness.</Review>
            <Review>A hokey, cliché-mining horror that boasts the odd haunted-house shock for the hardy viewer.</Review>
            <Review>Things soon go bump in the night, a broken clock chimes, a suspicious figure lurks in the woods etc.</Review>
            <Review>The film has some nice touches and interesting locations, although I felt it was contrived and ties itself in knots delivering the final twist.</Review>
            <Review>Blackwood never truly taps into any particular vein of overwhelming inchoate human terror.</Review>
            <Review>Blackwood's adherence to convention leaves it feeling strangely old fashioned.</Review>
            <Review>While efficiently filmed, Blackwood prefers using horror tropes as metaphors than for pure scares, lending events the feel of an ambitious but airless thesis.</Review>
            <Review>ingeniously overturns the creaky conventions of the haunted-house movie, [but] by the end it has over-explained its own trickery to a point where there is little room left for the uncanny to come out and play.</Review>

            <Review>It's hard to say exactly who the audience is for this packed-to-the-brim, sci-fi/action-adventure/family romp.</Review>
            <Review>Though it's not director Brad Bird's first retro-futuristic rodeo, Tomorrowland is his most stridently sermonizing.</Review>
            <Review>An aggressively optimistic script admonishes the lazy and irresolute and urges humanity to end war and save the environment; the proselytizing burdens an already onerous plot.</Review>
            <Review>Exhilarating on every level.</Review>
            <Review>Although "Tomorrowland" never runs out of objects or ideas, its supply of dramatic fuel soon springs a leak.</Review>
            <Review>Until its final act, Tomorrowland plays as a lighthearted techno-conspiracy thriller, Men in Black by way of Nancy Drew with the occasional whiff of Philip K. Dick paranoia and Pixarian high concept.</Review>
            <Review>Wholesome adventure with a dash of agitprop for the kiddies.</Review>
            <Review>Director Brad Bird (The Incredibles) and co-screenwriter Damon Lindelof (that guy, co-creator of Lost, knows from disappointing people) never quite match the hope they clearly want to inspire.</Review>
            <Review>'Tomorrowland's' an 'addiction of geography' utopia movie, allowing us fantasies of exploiting resources on other planets since we've already hoovered up everything down here.</Review>
            <Review>I wish -- oh how I wish -- it was a little bit better than it is.</Review>
            <Review>The aesthetics are easy to ape, but one should never underestimate the value Spielberg places on tight, clear, logical storytelling.</Review>
            <Review>In some ways, Tomorrowland feels like a tribute to Disney himself and even when it's getting preachy, it's hard not to be stirred by the message it's trying to send.</Review>

            <Review>The movie is overly ambitious but never dull, and the ensemble cast is fun to watch.</Review>
            <Review>The film's ability to confound expectations while delivering some big laughs may be its most crowd-pleasing characteristic but the anti-stereotype message rings clear as a bell throughout.</Review>
            <Review>Dope's biggest strength lies in its affectionate and honest portrait of a different kind of young urban blackness than we're used to seeing on movie screens.</Review>
            <Review>The film feels off-kilter more often than not, though it isn't without its inspired, successful moments.</Review>
            <Review>Even as Famuyiwa acknowledges the preconceptions that Malcolm's blackness engenders, he invites audiences to identify with the character on the basis of his relatable interests, aspirations and vulnerabilities.</Review>
            <Review>When so many black movie characters are simple stereotypes, it's a pleasure to see a film with real wit about the benefits and pitfalls of playing to and against those expectations.</Review>
            <Review>Dope feels a lot like vintage Spike Lee in how Famuyiwa plays it for comedy, but can't resist the urge to drop some wisdom on you too.</Review>
            <Review>Moore is fantastic as Malcolm, bringing just the right kind of dorky fidgetiness to the role.</Review>
            <Review>It's kind of facile and kind of corny, but I don't know... kind of important, too.</Review>
            <Review>Shot lightly and edited to the rhythm of rap music, Dope is a really fun movie that works despite the unnecessary moral message. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>A shooting star of a film that comes dangerously close to succumbing its own scatterbrained screenplay.</Review>
            <Review>Not without its problems, but mostly a smart, engaging, bigotry-busting escapade with a hugely appealing young cast and an unflaggingly cheerful optimism.</Review>

            <Review>"Call Me Lucky" will be an especially grueling ride for those who can identify with Crimmins' trauma. Yet its toughness does not at all diminish its worth. It remains an essential viewing experience.</Review>
            <Review>An earnest homage that also honors Mr. Crimmins's crusade to drive child pornography off the Internet.</Review>
            <Review>As Goldthwait repeatedly returns to footage of a recent performance by Crimmins, in which he's introduced as a great entertainer, all we see are the aimless rants of a self-righteous blowhard.</Review>
            <Review>If it accomplishes nothing else, the new documentary Call Me Lucky should bring some welcome attention to a man who's been under the radar for the past few decades, mostly by his own design.</Review>
            <Review>Angry, quixotic, tragic, heroic - Crimmins' life is stunning. Catch this portrait and you can definitely call yourself lucky.</Review>
            <Review>It's no wonder Goldthwait used his impressively evolving directing skills on his old pal Crimmins... Barry Crimmins deserves a documentary.</Review>
            <Review>Crimmins proves to be a courageous activist, gifted artist and gentle friend ... and Goldthwait films him with the skill, love and dedication that his dear mentor deserves.</Review>
            <Review>It's a wild ride for about half the movie. Then it becomes something else altogether. Being from Boston I was familiar with Crimmins' story, but I still wasn't ready for how deep the film cut.</Review>
            <Review>The content of Crimmins' words is the driving force of Call Me Lucky, but they're given a presentation of equal impact.</Review>
            <Review>The most interesting thing Call Me Lucky does is build up a character we may have been unfamiliar with at the start of the film, only to break him down again to give him even more complexity.</Review>
            <Review>Like 'World's Greatest Dad' and 'God Bless America,' its hero is a malcontent ultimately driven by his belief is human potential, often wasted though it may be.</Review>

            <Review>The lazy way The Gallows bundles its tropes together suggests that its creators' ambitions went no higher than simply getting a horror film made.</Review>
            <Review>In a quick 80 minutes, we get the back story, we meet the four core characters (all of the young actors do fine work), get the wits scared out of us about a half-dozen times and wind up with a VERY creepy ending.</Review>
            <Review>As the latest entry in the tired "found footage" horror subgenre, this on-the-cheap film has never met a cliché it didn't embrace like sweet death itself.</Review>
            <Review>A ridiculous fusion of "Paranormal Activity" and "Glee" that is so incredibly dumb that it is almost, but never quite, scary to behold.</Review>
            <Review>A cautionary note: If your horror film is about a high-school theater production and still, the acting's not the worst thing about it, something's gone awfully wrong.</Review>
            <Review>The Gallows has a cleverness that bobs, occasionally, above the surface of cesspool murk. You can't tell whether it's just flotsam or a corpse, but for most of the 80-minute run time it almost doesn't matter. It's at least something.</Review>
            <Review>I wouldn't want to definitively say The Gallows is the nadir of the found footage genre ... but I have to hope we're nearing rock bottom.</Review>
            <Review>Overall, there is nothing surprising or terrifying about The Gallows; predictable, dull and painfully by-the-book.</Review>
            <Review>A generic, laughably incompetent found-footage horror flick...</Review>
            <Review>A movie (essentially) made by teenagers, with a teenager's intelligence, and for teenagers.</Review>
            <Review>It may be easy to dismiss The Gallows as yet another 'found footage' movie but the film is actually a cleverly executed low-fi horror tale that manages to do a few things a bit differently and also delivers some solid scares too.</Review>
            <Review>It hardly seems to know what to do with itself.</Review>

            <Review>Frequently funny and sometimes perhaps offensive in the darkness of its humor.</Review>
            <Review>The Little Death is [Lawson's] feature film debut, and it's beautifully scripted, each of its five story lines working out the comic implications of a perverse urge.</Review>
            <Review>The mood will be too mild and shock-free for fans of Todd Solondz or early Neil LaBute; yet the film is sufficiently cool and quizzical to make you wonder where Lawson will turn next.</Review>
            <Review>There is simultaneously too much and not enough going on in writer/director/co-star Josh Lawson's feature debut.</Review>
            <Review>In the end, the film doesn't work.</Review>
            <Review>Darkly funny, occasionally poignant and teeming with the unexpected.</Review>
            <Review>Josh Lawson's film does its best not to judge its characters, and his jokes occasionally probe some dark and daring territory.</Review>
            <Review>Feeling a bit more like sketch comedy than cinema, The Little Death is not without laughs, but the tone is all over the map.</Review>
            <Review>The Little Death pushes the boundaries but isn't offensive, and at times the comedy really works.</Review>
            <Review>What prevents such risque material becoming a turn-off is the injection of genuine love into each tale.</Review>
            <Review>The film is an odd mixture of comedy and melodrama, with some tragedy thrown in. I would have liked it better had the film stuck to the comic elements and dumped the rest, but there is enough effective comedy in it for me to recommend it.</Review>
            <Review>Ambitious Aussie sex romp bites off way more than it manages to chew.</Review>

            <Review>There are so many acute insights, striking images and impressive performances in it, not least from lead Maisie Williams, it's a tragic shame that elsewhere inexperience shows and the last 15 minutes devolve into a morass of melodramatic incident.</Review>
            <Review>Carol Morley shows startling versatility and ambition with this jawdropping mash-up of 'If' and 'Picnic at Hanging Rock'.</Review>
            <Review>An imperfect but alluring study of psychological contagion that marks an auspicious advance in the field of narrative filmmaking for acclaimed docmaker Carol Morley.</Review>
            <Review>The end result is a mish-mash of promising ideas lost in naff filmmaking.</Review>
            <Review>A preposterous ending, saturated in baptismal overtones, is the last straw.</Review>
            <Review>This seductive waking-dream is a must-see.</Review>
            <Review>Writer and director Carol Morley goes for "a look how shocking we are" scene of incest. It just detracts from what had been an intriguing movie about mass hysteria.</Review>
            <Review>The film all leads to a melodramatic climax that wraps up the main character's explosive acting out in a too-neat package.</Review>
            <Review>Williams has been a promising young actress for a few years...The Falling allows her to unhinge for a while as her storyline creeps darker and darker.</Review>
            <Review>The beauty of the film is that it is at once personal and universal, with an ability to make you feel nostalgic for friendships and teenage journeys that were probably, at the time, not actually very nice at all.</Review>
            <Review>Often unnerving, and always interesting, but rarely as lyrical as the film seems to be aiming for.</Review>
            <Review>The Falling could have been a great horror film, though you will have to wade through most of it to see why.</Review>

            <Review>Except for the admirable testosterone on display that represents hours in the gym instead of the acting class, the rest of Magic Mike XXL is seriously stupid.</Review>
            <Review>If anything, better than its predecessor: looser, funnier, stranger, and vastly more subversive, a buddy road comedy that unexpectedly evolves into a celebration of female desire.</Review>
            <Review>Tatum has come a long way since his "Step Up" days (he was excellent in last year's "Foxcatcher"), but he makes a number of unfortunate choices here.</Review>
            <Review>As I sat there laughing, I realized I wasn't only entertained. I was moved and exhilarated. Not since the days of peak Travolta and Dirty Dancing has a film so perfectly nailed something essential about movie lust</Review>
            <Review>However discursive-and repetitive-the movie may be, it delivers the fantasy goods of formidable male bodies in motion, and ups the fantasy ante by making the men as sensitive, self-doubting and nurturing as they are virile.</Review>
            <Review>There's nothing at stake - their destination is a convention, not a contest, and it's not even clear they'll get to keep the singles that invariably rain down when they do their thing.</Review>
            <Review>Tatum and Manganiello in particular are clearly having a terrific time. It's no Toy Story 2, but as sequels go, Magic Mike XXL is a pony worth climbing on again.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>There's infinitely more than one anomaly to be found in "The Anomaly," a thoroughly nonsensical futuristic sci-fi thriller that makes a case for the perils of vanity projects.</Review>
            <Review>A smug, risible and far-from-anomalous attempt to beat Hollywood at its own game, from a talent whose commendable reach continues to exceed his grasp.</Review>
            <Review>Has Noel Clarke directed this baffling, unconvincing sci-fi just to show the world his chiselled, rock-hard pecs?</Review>
            <Review>Noel Clarke never shuns an opportunity to show off his buff body but displays little of the intelligence or flair needed to pull off his film's mind-stretching conceits.</Review>
            <Review>It's a nifty idea - especially in terms of structure - but that's about it, with Clarke's direction proving as flat as his performance.</Review>
            <Review>One day the world will find out what Noel Clarke has on Universal Pictures and it's going to change the film industry forever.</Review>
            <Review>Following the Roger Corman exploitation rule book to the letter, The Anomaly wrings maximum bangs for bucks from its tight budget while unashamedly showcasing the director's buff assets.</Review>
            <Review>Best described as a noble failure.</Review>
            <Review>Admittedly, in director/star Noel Clarke's low-budget sci-fi actioner, the acting and script do provoke surprise: both are so bad, you find yourself wondering if what's unfolding is some kind of parody.</Review>
            <Review>Saddled with unsayable dialogue and variable special effects, it's a corny and hackneyed film with ideas well above its station, that underwhelms from the start.</Review>
            <Review>The Anomaly has all the ingredients of a winning formula, in the wrong measures.</Review>
            <Review>Hilariously naff science-fiction mularkey that appears to have been cobbled together like Frankenstein's monster from the discarded body parts of Total Recall, The Matrix, Source Code and countless others.</Review>

            <Review>Less than propulsive as a narrative, but provocative, instructive, consistently surprising and a kind of slow-motion thriller.</Review>
            <Review>Despite being inspired by actual events, it all comes off more confounding than tragic or romantic.</Review>
            <Review>It illustrates, both bluntly and gently, the stultifying trap of male influence.</Review>
            <Review>Hausner's film feels authentically quiet and slower-paced for the time period ...</Review>
            <Review>It can be a strategically off-putting movie yet one that also steals under your skin scene by scene and through Ms. Schnoeink's slowly revealing performance as an ill-fated heroine turned future biographical footnote.</Review>
            <Review>One thing's certain: This is no swoony love story. It intoxicates all the same.</Review>
            <Review>Ms. Hausner's film proceeds at a stately, measured pace, and uses classical compositions and stiff exchanges to underline the tedium of early 19th-century bourgeois life.</Review>
            <Review>The film looks very beautiful, austere for sure but gorgeously staged and framed. The performances are very good but although it's not very long, it does lack some punch. One for fans of austere auteurs.</Review>
            <Review>The Austrian director's sixth film is ecstatically original: a work of film-history-philosophy with a digital-cinema palette of acutely crafted compositions.</Review>
            <Review>Fatally labors under excessively Teutonic discipline.</Review>
            <Review>Austrian director Jessica Hausner has fashioned a formal, feminist, wickedly humorous variation on history.</Review>
            <Review>The build-up scenes of talk and philosophising, in salons and sitting rooms, are hypnotic.</Review>

            <Review>What begins as a quirky portrait of the artist as a gringo mariachi troubadour proves to be a telling study of a lost soul whose palpable passion for his music acts as a surrogate for more meaningful human contact.</Review>

            <Review>That unnerving way Flynn has of taking us to dark, deliciously twisted places has been utterly massacred.</Review>
            <Review>The third offering from Flynn Dark Places does its best to stir a multitude of emotions within us, but in doing so, the film feels contrived and hurried.</Review>
            <Review>The surface level generic pleasures of Dark Places and the stellar cast are entertaining enough, even if it doesn't quite stick the landing.</Review>
            <Review>The mystery itself eventually becomes tiresome and shrug-worthy, even as the film breathlessly racks up the revelations.</Review>
            <Review>Director Gilles Paquet-Brenner marshaled a top-tier cast and commanded them to tromp across Flynn's intelligent bestseller like investigators muddying a crime scene.</Review>
            <Review>Each flashback or revelatory conversation fills in a few more details of the overheated story without giving us a reason to care about it in the first place.</Review>
            <Review>Dark Places has suggestions of a moody true-crime drama ... But languid pacing, poor directorial choices and a series of narrative dead ends make watching it a tiresome chore.</Review>
            <Review>Wishy-washy and all-round characterless, Dark Places is neither as dark nor as daring as its synopsis, title and everything else about it suggests. In fact, it's disappointingly vanilla and a film better left off for a small-screen viewing.</Review>
            <Review>Based on another page-turner by Gone Girl author Gillian Flynn, mystery thriller Dark Places can't match its predecessor for throat-grabbing suspense.</Review>
            <Review>The film races through the endless flashbacks and clichéd material and winds up feeling a bit of a potboiler.</Review>
            <Review>Paquet-Brenner invests the split-time action with some brooding menace and the cinematographer, Barry Ackroyd, does his best to lend some urgency, even as things spiral from suspense into outright silliness.</Review>
            <Review>The film, overall, is fatally uncertain of its identity - never quite certain whether it's a gruesome murder-mystery out to shock us or a heavy, character-based drama about a family torn apart.</Review>

            <Review>Funny and fascinating, this is the kind of evidence that support why governments need to have long-term vision and invest in, not scale back, funding in research.</Review>

            <Review>At least we get Pacino and Hunter. We may not understand why this story appealed to them, except for the fact that it gave them a chance to work together.</Review>
            <Review>Sure, there's an undeniable pleasure from watching Pacino and Hunter work the screen, but the syrupy, symbol-heavy script by first-time feature writer Paul Logan is weighed down further by cliches and false notes.</Review>
            <Review>If Manglehorn is to be remembered at all, it shall be for the excruciating first date that its title character goes on with a chirpy bank clerk he has long been chatting up.</Review>
            <Review>This is definitely a lonely-man-talking-to-his-cat movie.</Review>
            <Review>I spent most of the movie admiring Pacino's discipline in the role instead of believing he was the character.</Review>
            <Review>Pacino easily captures the character's longtime frustration, though it's Holly Hunter who supplies the story's heartbreak.</Review>
            <Review>Gets a sentimental grip on his flawed character.</Review>
            <Review>Mostly, Pacino just mumbles drunkenly as Green's camera drifts woozily in and out of focus and post-rockers Explosions in the Sky tinkle on the soundtrack.</Review>
            <Review>The poetic and the naturalistic clash together, and it doesn't look like it was done on purpose.</Review>
            <Review>Even set against this chequered history, Manglehorn is an extremely odd picture.</Review>
            <Review>Manglehorn is an intriguing film, or at least it should have been. David Gordon Green's latest is unfortunatel y passive, there might be depths to explore on a second or third watch, but I struggled to make it through the first.</Review>

            <Review>The quiet stretches actually serve their purpose here, creating a sense of intimacy with the characters as opposed to simply marking time between the shocks.</Review>
            <Review>Tepid ghost story Insidious: Chapter 3 tries and fails to emphasize character-driven drama over cheap, jump-scare-intensive thrills.</Review>
            <Review>You sort of want to give the movie a pass. But given its distinguished forebears, Insidious: Chapter 3 doesn't quite live up to expectations.</Review>
            <Review>They say the third time's the charm. Not with the Insidious series, it isn't.</Review>
            <Review>You need more than a few sudden noises and scary shocks to make a good horror movie. But "Insidious: Chapter Three" is at least an OK horror movie.</Review>
            <Review>Insidious: Chapter 3 may be a slight improvement over the previous sequel, but with its continued over-reliance on jump scares and a basic, repetitive plot, it merely becomes another chapter that will leave horror fans unsatisfied.</Review>
            <Review>With the complement of a supremely likable cast and heaps of effective jump scares, the chiller ably matches up to its underrated predecessors.</Review>
            <Review>It never really adds up to much in the end, leaving this chapter of the ghost-loving series with and a mediocre conclusion.</Review>
            <Review>This movie is unnecessarily sadistic. ... The story would have been just as effective without [some of its] scenes of violence, which verge on exploitation.</Review>
            <Review>Whannell offsets the supernatural mayhem with a palatable dose of regular life.</Review>

        <StoryLine>A kindred spirit to nerds everywhere, writer-comedian Dan Harmon has achieved celebrity via the hit series "Community," but cut his teeth writing for shows such as "The Sarah Silverman Program" and the Jack Black/Ben Stiller pilot "Heat Vision and Jack." After being fired from his signature creation, Harmon hits the road with his popular podcast and performs live for his cult-like fan base across the country. Known for his wit, cynicism, and disarming vulnerability, Harmontown finds Harmon bathed in the adoration of his fans as he confronts his personal demons and comes out on the other side. From acclaimed filmmaker Neil Berkeley (Beauty Is Embarrassing), and featuring past and present collaborators Sarah Silverman, Jack Black, Allison Brie, Joel McHale and many more, Harmontown tells Harmon's story with unabashed candor -- showing his highs, his lows, and everything in-between.(C) The Orchard</StoryLine>

            <Review>[This] kind of honesty is the difference between sitcoms like Community and 30 Rock, which can be clever and amusing, and a truly brilliant, risk-taking show like Louie, which can be either hilariously funny or mortally depressing.</Review>
            <Review>It's in the exploration of how "Community" fandom formed its own distinctive community of outcasts that the film excels, finally making sense of the show's cult popularity by diving into that cult and crowdsurfing on it.</Review>
            <Review>Harmon states at one point in the film that he just wants to be "the guy who makes people happy." This documentary does just that.</Review>
            <Review>The final 20 minutes are the strongest, when Harmon comes to some realizations about his behavior. Unless you're the biggest of fans, you may find yourself wishing that the film had reached this point earlier.</Review>
            <Review>Repeated praise of Mr. Harmon's nerdy fan base keeps emphasizing how appreciative its members are for his shining a light. Little splurts from an ingratiating score nudge us along.</Review>
            <Review>Berkeley's impartiality frees the director to include some of the writer's unpleasant moments on the tour.</Review>
            <Review>More than anything, though, the documentary explores a side of Harmon that you might expect but nonetheless feel privileged to see.</Review>
            <Review>A film that is far more complicated and entertaining than the fanboy home movie you might anticipate (and dread).</Review>

            <Review>The message at the heart of Harmontown shows how Harmon may have achieved certain goals, but the bigger challenge he still faces is learning to accept himself the way his audience and fans have accepted him.</Review>

            <Review>Do we want to spend 95 minutes of our summer holiday watching a film about a young, squabbling, dysfunctional British family on a sham trip? Yes, we do.</Review>
            <Review>It's not what you'd call "major" cinema, but it's a breezy entertainment, particularly if you're a fan of one or more of the cast members.</Review>
            <Review>A damp-eyed comedy whose banal title isn't the only thing needing improvement.</Review>
            <Review>Underfoot is a cast of young kids given too many cutesy moments and one-liners. In the middle of it all are actors like Rosamund Pike and David Tennant.</Review>
            <Review>There are a few amusing moments and flashes of charm but this Holiday is an uneven trip, with underwritten adult characters and a strange third act involving a poke at misguided social services.</Review>
            <Review>What We Did On Our Holiday sets up a sturdy comic scenario and then proceeds to head in another direction altogether-one that's nearly impossible to anticipate, making the film much more of a goofy delight than would have seemed likely at the outset.</Review>
            <Review>Proves without a doubt that America doesn't hold a monopoly on obnoxious child actors.</Review>
            <Review>Luckily for us, and unlike their bickering and scripted parents, the kids are largely left to improvise their parts and the result is mostly charming, sometimes hilarious.</Review>
            <Review>This blandly titled comedy from the U.K. spends so much setup time being generically clever, it's truly unexpected when, a third of the way in, things heat up in oddball ways.</Review>
            <Review>Clichéd British dramedy deals with divorce, loss.</Review>
            <Review>What We Did on Our Holiday emphasizes the celebration of life through masterful British comedy...</Review>
            <Review>...What We Did on our Holiday actually succeeds pretty well despite its rather hackneyed premise.</Review>

            <Review>The characters are uninteresting, the mood is dour, and the big supernatural twist barely elicits a shrug. No thanks.</Review>
            <Review>It's a lousy little film that is so dark and joyless that it leaves you feeling like you wasted your time watching it.</Review>
            <Review>The abundant violence in "The Stranger" ... is certainly nothing new. But the movie benefits greatly from Mr. Amoedo's largely steady direction and the uniform acting skills of its Chilean cast</Review>
            <Review>An amateur play at gravitas, one unsupported by dully weighted scenes and clunky dialogue, delivered mostly by English-speaking actors straining to hide Latin accents.</Review>
            <Review>"Twilight" had vampires that sparkled in the sun. "The Stranger" offers another twist: bloodsuckers that bore you to death.</Review>
            <Review>For viewers who don't need to suck down every last drop of vampire lore, The Stranger never gets the blood pumping.</Review>
            <Review>The genre deserves better, audiences deserve better, and the people of Chile deserve better than this lazy, artless nonsense.</Review>
            <Review>While it's in no way perfect, there's enough going on to keep you guessing where it's headed.</Review>
            <Review>The film is a different spin on the vampire myth, but the sluggish pace and gaps in logic prevent it from having the impact you really want from a story of this type.</Review>
            <Review>The Stranger feels like a piece of genre revisionism only in its deliberate, grinding pace, not in any refreshing turns of the plot.</Review>
            <Review>The Stranger is a murky drifter story with vampiric influences, but what starts as a mysterious quest soon turns into just another run-of-the-mill monster movie.</Review>
            <Review>The Stranger is far from a perfect film, but it's admirably eerie and remarkably restrained.</Review>

            <Review>It's not a sense of outrage that viewers are left with. It's sadness.</Review>
            <Review>Gibney ... has a gift for showing the workings of complex social systems, and he lays things out clearly and in a well-aced fashion ...</Review>
            <Review>You couldn't call Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief entertaining, exactly, but it is absolutely riveting.</Review>
            <Review>While he doesn't really uncover much that's new in "Going Clear," the way he's collected and assembled testimonials, documents and archival footage creates a cumulative effect that's chilling.</Review>
            <Review>Whether you come away seeing Scientology as a cult that ensnares vulnerable people or as a faith of self-empowerment, the film leaves a terrible taste of too much information. This must be its point, but take heed just the same.</Review>
            <Review>There is order and selection, of course - to say that this is storytelling is not to impugn its parts - but much of what he has to show you is remarkable in or out of this context.</Review>
            <Review>It's a grand history lesson, and an impressively vigorous op-ed; but is it cinema? Reader, I do not wish to say that it is.</Review>
            <Review>Gibney boils it down with skill, his cutting, construction, graphics, and score smoothly and seductively encapsulating Scientology's appeal.</Review>
            <Review>An indispensable general history of the enduringly controversial church.</Review>
            <Review>...a fair-minded expose that is decades overdue.</Review>
            <Review>For those who know almost nothing about the sinister side of Scientology-presuming there is any other side than the sinister side-Going Clear will be a terrific revelation.</Review>
            <Review>The film is a harrowing one, yet incomplete and one-sided, as is the nature of any film in which a secretive organization seeks to control the narrative.</Review>

            <Review>There's plenty to like here, but the movie focuses on the least interesting person on the screen, a curious choice considering we're talking life and death.</Review>
            <Review>I found myself relishing the skill of the cast and laughing at the sharply turned dialogue while wincing at the self-consciousness of the storytelling and the self-congratulatory pop-culture references.</Review>
            <Review>Somewhere along the way Earl eases up on the suburban-Wes Anderson whimsy and starts to find its heart, infusing the story's self-conscious cleverness and trick-shot set pieces with something sweeter, sadder, and even a little bit profound.</Review>
            <Review>Poignant without being melodramatic, overflowing with unforced charm, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl holds a unique appeal that's certain to last.</Review>
            <Review>The filmmaking from Alfonso Gomez-Rejon is hyper-stylized and a bit wonky at times, with a few odd security camera angles thrown into the mix. But it's also energetic and mostly fun to watch, especially the glimpses of their "awful" movies.</Review>
            <Review>The biggest flaw in Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is right there in the title: the first word, specifically.</Review>
            <Review>Rachel's dying isn't really about Rachel at all. It's about Greg. In fact, everything that happens in the film is about Greg.</Review>
            <Review>Although a touch too hip at times, and twee at others, Me and Earl is a sharply observed teenage drama and a real delight.</Review>
            <Review>Its Sundance buzz wears off well before the end credits roll.</Review>
            <Review>This delicate movie elevates itself from the usual run-of-the-mill schooldays saga with a script that is one part funny, one part tragic and all parts thoroughly human.</Review>
            <Review>There is whimsy, but also a grounded realism in the idea that life is a journey and not always a smooth one.</Review>
            <Review>Me and Earl and The Dying Girl is a film that shows that behind the director, there is a new voice with a lot of talent. [Full Review in Spanish]</Review>

            <Review>We know these characters are going through a lot, even if we don't always see it. And so, this short, ramshackle, shrinking movie manages to stick with you.</Review>
            <Review>There are two reasons to check out People Places Things - but neither the lead actors nor the characters they play are among them.</Review>
            <Review>Perhaps the wimpy ending is exactly what wishy-washy Will Henry deserved. I, on the other hand, deserved better.</Review>
            <Review>Small, smart and inescapably independent, "People Places Things" has its own offbeat and charmingly low-key way of seeing the world.</Review>
            <Review>Strouse has come up with a near-perfect blend of awkward wit and good-natured sweetness.</Review>
            <Review>As the movie progresses, Will learns, in his low-key way, that life is full of unexpected twists, that love is hard to put away, and that people who share children can never fully leave each other.</Review>
            <Review>Nominated for the Sundance Grand Jury Prize, the film has plenty of smart, witty lines, and Clement is the perfect actor to give them life.</Review>
            <Review>Clement's predilection for center stage is real and actually kind of astounding, pole-vaulting James Strouse's low-key romantic comedy into something much sturdier.</Review>
            <Review>Strouse has a built a career on small, personal stories, and this film is no different.</Review>
            <Review>Clement is better-suited as a foil to Conchord-like absurdity, where it works as a droll counterweight.</Review>
            <Review>Strouse offers a light treatment of a heavy situation. And the longer it goes, the deeper the sense of reality, the better the scenes. That's more than unusual. Most films get worse in the third act, not better.</Review>
            <Review>People Places Things is a mildly amusing observational comedy about relationships that has its droll moments.</Review>

            <Review>Lacks resonance and a steady directorial hand.</Review>
            <Review>For a movie with extremely loud punk-rock music at its core, "Ten Thousand Saints" is a pleasantly low-key experience; it's a small-scale character drama about learning to live with loss.</Review>
            <Review>The film shows all the earmarks of a story too heavily compressed; the complications among the entwined families pile up after a while, and the period milieu feels arbitrary.</Review>
            <Review>Jude, our narrator, is paper thin. His most memorable qualities are his gangly frame and his bright blue eyes.</Review>
            <Review>It's a sensitive and interesting film.</Review>
            <Review>"Ten Thousand Saints" pulsates with full-blooded supporting characters who create a tragic-absurd tapestry of decay and rebellion in the Ronald Reagan years, from depressed New England to volatile New York. It's too bad the center cannot hold.</Review>
            <Review>Equal parts sensitive and overwrought, intelligent and preachy.</Review>
            <Review>The emotionally uneven film is more intriguing in parts than as a whole, with the periphery characters often more compelling than the somewhat passive protagonist.</Review>
            <Review>The movie feels like a quickly-sketched version of something much, much bigger.</Review>
            <Review>Ethan Hawke is so funny in Ten Thousand Saints that he nearly keeps the movie afloat.</Review>
            <Review>It's far from a perfect film, but when it locks on to an emotionally complex moment, the feature succeeds more than a fails.</Review>
            <Review>The cinematography by Ben Kutchins works more from grime than grim, capturing a battered backdrop for the characters rather than a cartoon battlefield of drugs and crime/</Review>

            <Review>Carolla, who co-wrote and co-directed the picture with Kevin Henchis, has a way of making his remarkably stiff screen presence endearing. He plays Bruce with gentle self-mockery and a touch of genuine pathos.</Review>

            <Review>The truth is, I found "Road Hard" to be a low-key gem, a consistently funny albeit conventional story about a guy who's almost always the funniest person in the room, and is almost always his own worst enemy.</Review>
            <Review>A lot rings painfully true about showbiz in Road Hard, a bittersweet look at a middle-aged comic dealing with a stalled career.</Review>

            <Review>Showcasing juicy performances by its actors who tear into their stock roles with admirable conviction, the film looks terrific.</Review>
            <Review>More than a mere homage, "We Are Still Here" is the kind of movie you wish you could take back in time with you and project in your favorite 42nd Street grindhouse.</Review>
            <Review>Once "We Are Still Here" unsticks itself from hommage mode, it finds something cathartically funny inside the fearsome.</Review>
            <Review>"We Are Still Here" will make you scream and make you laugh, and possibly leave you speechlessly gesticulating at a charred zombielike ghost in the background. But the peak moments are too few ...</Review>
            <Review>We Are Still Here is the latest iteration of people unwittingly stumbling upon an ancient menace, and it succeeds more than it fails, thanks largely to the nice work of first-time director Ted Geoghegan.</Review>
            <Review>Geoghegan shows a healthy love of gore as he smears the quiet landscape with red.</Review>
            <Review>A wonderfully weird, gory and full of heart and poignancy, We Are Still Here is an assured and well-crafted debut from Geoghegan that's clearly a heartfelt love letter embracing what genre fans enjoy most about horror movies.</Review>
            <Review>Those who can spot a Fulci reference will likely embrace this creepy, bloody haunted house movie more than mainstream viewers. But if you like your horror, it's a treat.</Review>
            <Review>A love letter to Fulci and the Italian masters, this retro horror tale recalls his House by the Cemetery by way of Sam Raimi's Evil Dead.</Review>
            <Review>Full of smart and not always subtle references to horror film classics, especially those of European origin, and to New England literature, We Are Still Here is a treat for educated fans.</Review>
            <Review>Geoghegan does a great job in keeping the tension high, teasing his ghastly ghosts with escalating bouts of gore infested violence to make We Are Still Here a film that will satisfy both haunted house and gore horror fans.</Review>

            <Review>While there's something to be admired in the film's economy and tightly controlled atmospheric tension, its effectiveness is limited by the derivative storyline, mostly unmodulated performances and the obviously miniscule budget.</Review>
            <Review>Pod uses its micro-budget to its advantage and rises above some uneven performances to deliver a story that feels akin to a lost episode of The X-Files, filled with uncertainty, conspiracy and real emotional stakes.</Review>
            <Review>Pod, director Mickey Keating's deviously intriguing followup to cultist murder mystery Ritual, taps into a supernatural/suburban ambiguity reminiscent of the best of The X-Files.</Review>
            <Review>Pod is able to find tension, but it's just too undercooked.</Review>
            <Review>[A] tense, paranoid tale combining cabin-in-the-woods horror, sci fi creature feature and conspiracy theory thriller.</Review>
            <Review>Pod may not break the rules of the cabin in the woods genre completely, but it's a smart, gripping chiller that delivers. Seek it out.</Review>
            <Review>The third act munsons - there is no better word for it (thanks, 1996's Kingpin) - a lot of the excellent build-up.</Review>
            <Review>Pod turns on an ambiguity (are we watching a psychodrama or a creature feature?) which will be resolved only when Ed finally, inevitably, ventures into the dark cellar to see if there is anything or anyone really down there.</Review>

            <Review>Tremors 5: Bloodlines is the beyond-generic reboot that may just bury this franchise once and for all.</Review>

            <Review>Why does 'Tremors 5: Bloodlines' seem so non-threatening? Perhaps madcap weapons expert Burt Gummer has truly 'run out of ammo.'</Review>

            <Review>That Harry Potter magic proves decidedly elusive in this chintzy British children's fantasy.</Review>
            <Review>It is all very over-the-top and in-your-face, a storytelling approach that feels grossly dated, like something done by The Three Stooges.</Review>
            <Review>There is nothing objectionable in screenwriter Chris Hurford's adaptation of Byng's children's book and there is a good deal of merit to its spirited protagonist.</Review>
            <Review>Cute and terribly sweet, this family film skews quite young. It is aimed at the tweens who are familiar with the idea of famous children, but don't really know much about how other children live their lives.</Review>
            <Review>Occasionally cute but often over-the-top orphan adventure.</Review>
            <Review>This neither-fish-nor-fowl project should end up pleasing no one.</Review>
            <Review>Cassidy's clear blue eyes are so mesmerizing that it is easy to believe they can bewitch anyone.</Review>
            <Review>This desperately terrible children's fantasy is an unpleasant mishmash of dated slapstick, unwittingly sinister adventure, and icky magic.</Review>
            <Review>There are too few films that aim for a female young teen market. The stories covered may well charm girls growing to young adulthood. But beyond that demographic this film may not be greatly rewarding.</Review>

            <Review>Here's one thing that's rarely complained about in a review: The acting and dialogue in Oh Hell No! are not bad enough. Partially, this can be credited to less screen time for Tara Reid.</Review>
            <Review>This is the sequel that chokes by stuffing itself with endless, self-indulgent cameos. This is the sequel that prioritizes product placement, which is so blatant that it becomes a joke in and of itself before it loops back around to insulting.</Review>
            <Review>At around the hour mark, I was checking the clock frequently and despairing for how I spend my time. Unlike the first two movies, it didn't feel like I was participating in a Sharknado night. It felt like I was subjecting myself to it.</Review>
            <Review>Perfectly likable characters, played by fondly remembered former stars, are dispatched bloodily.</Review>
            <Review>There is a line of defense the movie throws up, a sort of camouflage, in which the purposely bad is blended with the actually bad, that makes the critic want to pack up his typewriter and repair despairing to the bar.</Review>
            <Review>You'd better like seeing fake sharks munch on people's extremities if you plan to enjoy Sharknado 3.</Review>
            <Review>One might begin to wonder if the franchise is running out of steam - until an amazing last quarter hour which, even with OTT promises in place, manages to turn all the dials one higher.</Review>
            <Review>To give this film a decent score would be an insult to the many low-budget features out there that scrape every penny they can find together to produce something good.</Review>
            <Review>So wacky I almost fell asleep.</Review>
            <Review>So clumsy was Sharknado 3, it seemed slapped together by someone with dorsal fins rather than opposable thumbs.</Review>
            <Review>Though Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No! delivers bigger stakes, more sharks, more gore, more cameos, and more interaction with its viewers, the third installment to the series is a serious departure from what was appealing about the original.</Review>
            <Review>All I know is that you'll have fun for a hot minute and then gradually start to seriously question how you're prioritizing your life. The true "Sharknado Effect."</Review>

            <Review>"Gravy" left a bad taste in my mouth, but for those with an eye for a potential cult film, it may be deliciously perfect.</Review>
            <Review>[It] succeeds where so many other horror-comedies fail by remembering to be funny first and shocking second. Having a tasty script helps, too.</Review>
            <Review>Falls under the weight of its own self satisfaction, eliciting a ton of flat improv, lame ad libbing, unresolved sub-plots, and a climax that goes nowhere very fast.</Review>
            <Review>This is a deranged and maniacal comedy that embraces its psychotic behavior to the fullest degree and is completely hysterical because of it. James Roday has found the golden ticket to successfully entertaining horror comedies.</Review>
            <Review>While it may not be a modern day EATING RAOUL, it sure is fun to watch it try.</Review>
            <Review>Cannibal killers invade a Mexican restaurant and torment the staff and patrons in this broad but not particularly funny comedy/horror picture.</Review>
            <Review>Much too self-consciously zany to be funny, "Gravy" is best approached as a celebration of make-up achievements.</Review>

            <Review>Once an idea is introduced, it's tossed aside, unexplored; though there's plenty of talk, this isn't exactly a sci-fi "My Dinner With Andre." Tense music substitutes for genuine tension.</Review>

        <Title>Awake: The Life Of Yogananda</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>87</Duration>
        <StoryLine>AWAKE: The Life of Yogananda is an unconventional biography about an Indian Swami who brought yoga and meditation to the West in the 1920s. This feature documentary explores the life and teachings of Paramahansa Yogananda, who authored the spiritual classic Autobiography of a Yogi, which has sold millions of copies worldwide and is a go-to book for seekers, philosophers and yoga enthusiasts today. It was the only book that Steve Jobs had on his iPad, and he arranged to give away 800 copies of it to the dignitaries who attended his memorial service. It was also a point of entry into Eastern mysticism for George Harrison, Russell Simmons and countless yogis. By personalizing his own quest for enlightenment and sharing his struggles along the path, Yogananda made ancient teachings accessible to a modern audience, attracting many followers and ultimately helping millions of seekers today to turn their attention inwards, bucking the temptations of the material world in pursuit of self-realization.

            <Review>A voice-over narrator supplies some of Yogananda's more inspired passages, but the affected tone makes it all sound rather silly.</Review>
            <Review>If you want to understand yoga as something beyond a workout exercise, this spiritual documentary could be a fine start.</Review>
            <Review>Those looking for further enlightenment might want to pass on the feel-good cinematic hagiography known as "Awake: The Life of Yogananda."</Review>
            <Review>It's not quite hagiography, but it's almost hard not to get caught up in the film's admiring tone.</Review>
            <Review>Unfortunately, while the swami taught his disciples to explore the depths of their very souls, the film barely scratches the surface of his life and teachings.</Review>
            <Review>Yogananda's story is a fascinating one. And although the documentary will likely attract a discrete group, it has the potential for broader appeal.</Review>
            <Review>After a while, all this serenity becomes soporific. It's one for the already enlightened.</Review>
            <Review>Co-directors Paola di Florio and Lisa Leeman honor the man with a reverential though rarely stuffy portrait.</Review>
            <Review>A rounded portrait of the Father of Yoga in the West that celebrates his practical and uplifting art of spiritual living.</Review>
            <Review>Presented with engrossing historical footage and dreamy, mystical imagery.</Review>
            <Review>Fittingly enlightening, "Awake: The Life of Yogananda" is a vivid, elegantly assembled portrait of the savvy guru with the cherubic face and penetrating gaze who brought meditation to the West.</Review>
            <Review>A film that works both for followers and for those interested in knowing what yoga is truly about. Hint: It's not about six-pack abs.</Review>

            <Review>Breslin, whose recent resume hasn't lived up to her Oscar nomination for "Little Miss Sunshine," needs to find something worthy of her talents. An Oscar nominee shouldn't even watch "Final Girl," much less star in it.</Review>
            <Review>This patchy, underwritten thriller could almost pass for a critique of any number of genre forebears in which the mere presence of a hot, ass-kicking female avenger is meant to seem subversive.</Review>
            <Review>Tasteless thriller deals with rape, assault, and abuse.</Review>
            <Review>Too bloody and violent for me, but this thriller proves Abigail Breslin is all grown up now and still ready for her close ups.</Review>
            <Review>Shields has made a cheeseburger with the cheese sadly left on the side.</Review>
            <Review>Tyler Shields is an incredibly creative visionary, yet Final Girl is nothing but revenge cinema in its basest form (despite the film's zany personality).</Review>
            <Review>"Final Girl" isn't interested in its title character beyond that of a pawn. Abigail Breslin does everything a really strong actor possibly could with this slimly conceived role, but she deserves better.</Review>
            <Review>between these dual narratives is a discourse on men and women... where victimhood is up for grabs and easily distorted in its presentation - and that is the kind of confronting, uncomfortable conversation about gender that horror does best.</Review>
            <Review>"Final Girl" isn't about building sympathies or establishing motives, it's purely concentrated on creating a pretty picture. Characters always come secondary to style, deflating the entire effort.</Review>
            <Review>The filmmakers never really answer inevitable questions: What's the point of these fussy allusions?</Review>

            <Review>By the time we reached the climactic and fantastically over-the-top showdown, I realized that while the characters were indeed trying to corner the market on smoldering glances, faux-Shakespearean proclamations and in-your-face symbolism.</Review>
            <Review>As good-looking as the movie and its stars are, "Ardor," whose title refers to a literal state of burning, never manages to catch fire.</Review>
            <Review>"Ardor" lacks tension, maybe because the actors are playing archetypes: Little is said, and there are few surprises.</Review>
            <Review>Here is a movie that ends with a can't-miss scenario - a siege on a farmhouse in which the heroes are vastly outnumbered and outgunned - yet still fails to ever quicken your pulse.</Review>
            <Review>A densely atmospheric, Sergio Leone-steeped western that ultimately proves too reverential for its own good.</Review>
            <Review>Much of this movie is bewilderingly slow, while the big action scenes are mostly unbelievable.</Review>
            <Review>A strong exercise in genre, but one constricted by its chosen syntax and semantics rather than one that reconfigures and complicates them.</Review>
            <Review>Fendrik's attempt to stage cat-and-mouse violence as a hypnagogic trip results in a few brief moments of strange magic, but Ardor too often slips into full-on sleep mode.</Review>
            <Review>Ardor is essentially George Stevens' Shane set in wettest Argentina, with the distractingly handsome Gael García Bernal in the Alan Ladd role.</Review>
            <Review>Magical realism meets agrarian guerrilla warfare in a tropical political thriller. As aborigine rainforest resistance with help from a mythical half jaguar guerrilla warrior turning up, goes toe to toe with corporate mercenaries pushing them off the land.</Review>
            <Review>There's only so much redolent framing one can appreciate in a movie so sluggishly paced and untethered to intrigue.</Review>
            <Review>Ardor is a Western in spirit, but with a serious lack of tension, it's far less notable than some of its obvious influences.</Review>

            <Review>Falling back repeatedly on in-your-face symbolism - especially with regard to the specter of decline - Mr. Salvadori seems content to idle in neutral.</Review>
            <Review>Thoroughly nonjudgmental in its observations, Pierre Salvadori's In the Courtyard ranks as one of the funnier films about victims of depression and mental illness.</Review>
            <Review>I enjoyed it, and I probably won't ever think of it again five minutes after I finish this review.</Review>
            <Review>Salvadori explores themes and layers of the genre that are very uncommon. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>A sensitive movie that explores morality and friendship between neurotic and solitary characters. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Catherine Deneuve does another impressive acting job as a woman losing her bearings, but striking up a mutually helpful friendship with an out-of work musician hired by her husband as their building super. Warmth and humor.</Review>

        <Title>Tio Papi</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>90</Duration>
        <StoryLine>It was a bachelor's life for hard-working and fun-loving Ray Ray Dominguez (Joey Dedio) who dreams of leaving the barrio for a more carefree existence in Miami. That's until one day when everything changed - and he became a reluctant "Tio Papi" aka Uncle Daddy to his sister's six children ages six to 16. Now, in charge of raising this energetic (and expensive) clan, Ray Ray must make important decisions on what life really is all about. Combining heart-warming drama with light-hearted comedy, TIO PAPI, directed by Fro Rojas from the original screenplay by Joey Dedio and Brian Herskowitz, is an upbeat story of life's unexpected surprises and ultimately what matters the most - the love of family.

        <StoryLine>FRESH DRESSED offers a fascinating glimpse inside the complex relationship between fashion and hip-hop, and the hustle and swagger that brought baggy pants and graffiti-drenched jackets from the streets to high fashion catwalks and Middle American shopping malls. Director Sacha Jenkins draws from a rich mix of archival materials from the 70s, 80s and 90s and present day in-depth interviews with more than 70 music and fashion industry luminaries including: Pharrell Williams, Kanye West, Nasir Jones, Dapper Dan, Big Daddy Kane, Riccardo Tisci and Andr� Leon Talley. The result is FRESH DRESSED, a passionate re-telling of the evolution of hip hop culture from the South Bronx to Paris Fashion Week. (C) Goldwyn</StoryLine>

            <Review>As rhythmic and hypnotic as the old-school hip-hop-heavy soundtrack that supports it.</Review>
            <Review>"Fresh Dressed" shines a light on the hip-hop fashion phenomenon, but it's not just about hip hop; it's about ambition and absorption and our need - black, white, brown, whatever - for authenticity.</Review>
            <Review>The throwback elements of "Fresh Dressed" are probably enough for most people to thoroughly enjoy the film. But nostalgia only gets you so far, and I hungered for more sustenance.</Review>
            <Review>Much of this film is told through interviews: Mr. Kani is fascinating and also funny; Mr. Combs is cocksure; and Kanye West is appealingly hyper.</Review>
            <Review>Fashion is the primary focus of Sacha Jenkins' vibrant documentary on hip-hop style-and indeed, it leaves no Air Jordan or FUBU overall unturned.</Review>
            <Review>[An] engaging history of hip-hop fashion ...</Review>
            <Review>Excellent docu on hip-hop fashion's rise has profanity.</Review>
            <Review>The film offers a scholarly commentary on aspiration, self-projection and the street-level appropriation of couture exclusivity ...</Review>
            <Review>The fascination of Fresh Dressed lies in the inventive and revealing way it interweaves politics, music and sociology. This, it turns out, is much more than just a documentary about fashion.</Review>
            <Review>Jenkins' film is never explicitly judgemental, but it does point us toward the ideological switcheroo that governs all fashion.</Review>
            <Review>Hardly revelatory, though about more than just street fashion.</Review>
            <Review>With a bright explosion of politics, Kangol caps, Air Jordans, gold chains and Ralph Lauren Polo shirts, Fresh Dressed charts the genesis of hip-hop fashion in American culture.</Review>

            <Review>A quirky meditation on the weight of the soul. Depicts a reality bathed in such absurdity that it feels like fantasy.... The film is caught between moments of great storytelling and a distended metaphor.</Review>
            <Review>Gorgeous cinematography balances impeccable acting and directing for a romantic trifle that delights with design more than content.</Review>
            <Review>"1001 Grams" achieves a charming equipoise of levity and gravity, of formal rigor and soulful sentiment.</Review>
            <Review>Hamer's style is what might happen if Ulrich Seidl liked people, with immaculate balance in each shot, but the emotions in focus, as well.</Review>
            <Review>This portrait of an introverted soul brought out of her shell is not without its charms.</Review>
            <Review>Despite the weighty title, this is an extremely light, delicate art film that rarely makes a false move.</Review>
            <Review>...takes its central metaphor very seriously.</Review>
            <Review>Frame after frame in 1001 Grams has such a strikingly composed look.</Review>
            <Review>For some, this movie will be too slow and too quiet. But for those who can tolerate a story that unfolds slowly and a director who makes gentle fun of his characters, 1001 Grams will be rewarding.</Review>
            <Review>[Hamer's] new film is both appealing and more than a little trite, finding pleasantly glib solutions to the terrors of mortality and loss.</Review>

            <Review>"Avengers: Age of Ultron" is a sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic adventure with one kinetic thrill after another. It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe.</Review>
            <Review>More does not necessarily equal better; here, more is just ... meh.</Review>
            <Review>The sharp, interpersonal dramedy that made the first movie such a delight is again present in flashes, but not infrequently it is drowned out by the noisy, inevitable need to Save the World.</Review>
            <Review>For the most part, "Avengers: Age of Ultron" is the hard-charging, mind-boggling spectacle fans are looking for. Smash indeed.</Review>
            <Review>World-saving is no longer a surprise to these characters. It's work. Grunt work. For them. For us.</Review>
            <Review>It's too bad Avengers: Age of Ultron lacks dramatic tension and has a more or less nonsensical plotline, because its component parts are frequently entertaining.</Review>
            <Review>It's as entertaining as holiday fireworks: initially exciting, which fades; then just loud, and finally the sense of time wasted because everything you just watched was pretty, but utterly meaningless.</Review>
            <Review>Whedon has already announced that he won't be on board for the next installment, and you can hardly blame him. These films don't require a director. All they need are bean counters.</Review>
            <Review>Several thrilling action sequences, a great many good jokes, and an unshakable sense that everybody is just going through the paces.</Review>
            <Review>This Avengers is darker, louder, stranger and soapier than the first one.</Review>
            <Review>As a deliberate extension of multiple brands all at once, as the latest lily pad to Marvel's next big thing, it's a solid success, if not much in the way of an evolution.</Review>

            <Review>Llosa's film pushes its enigmatic and quietly brooding qualities to the point that it's inaccessible, despite some mildly intriguing spiritual story elements and skilled performances ...</Review>
            <Review>The majority of the film strives for ethereal lyricism but the melodrama of these lives never proves strong enough to anchor any real emotional connection.</Review>
            <Review>Some movies practically dare you to give up. "Aloft" is a beautifully shot, frustratingly vague and deeply ponderous mystery/spiritual journey about terminally unhappy souls.</Review>
            <Review>The truth is elusive, and so is Aloft. Maybe viewers will figure it out cleaner than this reviewer did. And maybe the best answers aren't served on platters.</Review>
            <Review>Aloft can sometimes be too slow-paced and enigmatic for its own good, the presence of these two actors helps to elevate Llosa's film to a higher level of cinematic prowess.</Review>
            <Review>Aloft keeps us at a distance -- a problem for a film about spirituality that gives little critique or insight into the mythical healing process it is about.</Review>
            <Review>A sad and dreamy drama with many New Age touches and a fondness for lingering over barren tundra that stands as a metaphor for its sense of loss.</Review>
            <Review>It's bleak and beautiful at the same time.</Review>
            <Review>An atmospheric but vague movie that functions like a therapy session, counseling acceptance and forgiveness via a storyline that seems pinched and forced in relation to the wide open spaces of the images.</Review>
            <Review>For much of the film, the audience is busy connecting dots between the two storylines to figure out what happened between mother and son. But the lines that get drawn are unsatisfying.</Review>

            <Review>Puzzling out the whos, the whys and the WTFs of this marvellously oddball case takes a back seat to drinking in the film's dark, shining evocation of night and the city.</Review>
            <Review>It's easy to see why it won the prize at Berlin. As well as being moodier than a Nine Inch Nails soundscape and crackling with barely concealed sexual tension and brimming with angst, Jingsong Dong's cinematography is sublime.</Review>
            <Review>Plays like a straightforward police procedural, buoyed by the intense dynamic between Fan and Gwei and a visual inventiveness that makes far more of an impact than its story.</Review>
            <Review>Black Coal, Thin Ice is a painstakingly deliberate neo-noir, heavy on atmosphere and taking its time to build.</Review>

        <Duration>112</Duration>
        <StoryLine>SOUL BOYS OF THE WESTERN WORLD is a journey through the 1980s and beyond; the story of a band, an era and how one small gathering of outsiders in London shaped the entire world's view of music and fashion. The film is not only a fascinating, often hard-hitting social and cultural document of the time, but a brutally honest story of how friendships can be won, lost and ultimately regained.

            <Review>An energetic, entertainingly assembled documentary portrait ...</Review>
            <Review>This slapdash but endearing doc about the rise, fall and resurrection of '80s pop outfit Spandau Ballet is an inside job, packed with strong archive footage yet lacking anything you'd call truly incisive.</Review>
            <Review>The band wasn't that great. Neither is the movie, which, if directed with a bit more sensitivity toward the latent comedy, could have been hilarious.</Review>
            <Review>You won't be convinced that Spandau Ballet was the best band of the 1980s. Even if they did have the best bums.</Review>
            <Review>It helps to be a Spandau fan, of course, but the smart, layered contextualizing and historicizing of the group within the film makes it a gift for any pop-culture aficionado.</Review>
            <Review>Standard issue band history doc, but it smartly finds depth in a particularly shallow era in pop.</Review>
            <Review>The advantage to Hencken's approach is that it makes Soul Boys Of The Western World play like a movie version of a printed oral history.</Review>
            <Review>[Soul Boys] does a fantastic job explaining the youth movement that birthed the New Romantic genre.</Review>
            <Review>An absorbing and insightful delve into how the band defined the post-punk -- and consciously flamboyant UK -- music scene and went on to be an international phenomenon.</Review>
            <Review>[Hencken] makes a very persuasive case for Spandau Ballet's place in the Britpop pantheon.</Review>

            <Review>There is ample photographic evidence that the '70s were not, in fact, the best-looking, coolest decade ever. But you wouldn't know it from watching The Connection.</Review>
            <Review>It's a stylish affair, very solidly made if not exactly breaking new ground in our understanding of events or in the way the movies depict them.</Review>
            <Review>It may prove too slow for some and the meandering can be a little maddening, but overall it's worth the effort.</Review>
            <Review>It starts with gunshots - a Mercedes and its driver are riddled by motorcycle-riding assassins in broad daylight - and the pace of "The Connection" is bang-bang brisk most of the rest of the way.</Review>
            <Review>While the story lacks focus here and there, the film never feels overplayed. It's a work of bloody style and solid substance.</Review>
            <Review>The movie's strength is in its conception of Michel and Zampa, who develop a destructive rivalry, rooted in their mutual determination to prove their superiority.</Review>
            <Review>Not just a strong likeness of Michel, Jean Dujardin has the right over-sized presence for the honest Magistrate.</Review>
            <Review>It's familiar. We see the tale unfolding before our eyes from the beginning. But that doesn't make it any less enjoyable. It's a fast-paced story, confidently told.</Review>
            <Review>Excels at playing with expected genre conventions and crime story boilerplate to shrink a globe-trotting incident down to, essentially, a strategic game of cat and mouse.</Review>
            <Review>Jimenez hasn't exactly broken the period-crime-thriller mold, but he's built a solid entertainment, with techniques well absorbed from the American movie tradition.</Review>

But when she agrees to a blind date and the wrong man comes to her door...her perfect world is shattered by a brutal assault. Even after her attacker, William (Shiloh Fernandez, Evil Dead), is convicted and locked away for the crime, Miranda can't overcome the fear and trauma enough to put her orderly life back together. Desperate for closure, she reaches out to William - first through letters, then prison visits - and slowly builds a relationship with him.

            <Review>Mikati never settles on whether he's steering an identity crisis drama or an exploitative vengeance fantasy.</Review>
            <Review>For most of the way, "Return to Sender" merges creepy and sexy to good effect, thanks to a close-to-the-vest performance by Rosamund Pike, the missing wife of "Gone Girl."</Review>
            <Review>Pike phones in a reprise of her Oscar-nominated "Gone Girl" performance, complete with brittle perfection and a loose screw.</Review>
            <Review>Even with the dramatic buildup, Mikati hesitates to make Return to Sender an all-out revenge fantasy, and the characters are too sketchy for an effective psychological thriller.</Review>
            <Review>Rosamund Pike deserves better than this queasy exploitation pic, which plays as a belated dry run for "Gone Girl."</Review>
            <Review>Return to Sender is an equally repulsive and dreadful movie that deserves to be more than spoiled -- it should be murdered, buried, and never discussed again.</Review>
            <Review>The audience, though, will surely guess the twist which is coming.</Review>
            <Review>Whilst there's probably not enough story here to warrant the film's admittedly short running time, when it reaches its heightened emotional ending, you have to hand it to screenwriters Patricia Beauchamp and Joe Gossett for trying something different.</Review>
            <Review>Her performance makes this film digestible, but also makes us yearn for her to receive better roles in the future.</Review>
            <Review>... a slow-burn female payback thriller in the tradition of Siegel's 'Beguiled' and Miike's masterful 'Audition' ... definitely deserved better than being summarily shipped to Vido-on-Demand Land.</Review>

            <Review>She's no Mata Hari, and she may not get the guy (though she does get some) - but that doesn't mean she can't be a different sort of badass, the kind that's a reminder of McCarthy's range beyond just physical comedy.</Review>
            <Review>Melissa McCarthy keeping pace in foot chases with actors who spend the better portion of their lives in a gym is about as funny as it gets, unless you count the antonymous editing of the action sequences.</Review>
            <Review>Feig keeps his Spy machinery cranking so smoothly that nothing said or done feels as outrageous as, in fact, it is. The truth serum Spy drops into our fizzy drinks makes us feel so good that we don't even realize we've been schooled.</Review>
            <Review>Melissa McCarthy shines in this clever action-comedy showcase provided by the writer and director Paul Feig, but the movie's tightly contrived plot and uniformly positive emotions constrain her comic genius.</Review>
            <Review>Hollywood is gradually figuring out what to do with Melissa McCarthy.</Review>
            <Review>McCarthy has much more to discover about herself as an actor and an avatar and a cultural signifier, and I hope she doesn't get trapped by one role, one genre or one franchise. But her campaign of conquest is going well.</Review>
            <Review>Much has been said about McCarthy, an amiable plus-size lady, as a viable movie star but there is no longer any question. Brash, bold and believable at every turn, Spy is a showcase and a celebration of her as a performer.</Review>
            <Review>Spy is many things: A clever spoof. A chance for Melissa McCarthy and her co-stars to strut their comedic chops. An international romp. It's also a pretty darn engaging spy film. It's about a woman leaning in and finding her inner Bond.</Review>
            <Review>At its core, this action-packed, globe-trotting, gender-switched Bond spoof is about lookism.</Review>
            <Review>Spy is hilarious good fun.</Review>
            <Review>The film's quantity-over-quality approach affords star Melissa McCarthy the luxury of both owning the film and sharing the glory with a wonderful supporting cast.</Review>
            <Review>Witty at times, brainless at others, not everything seems to gel, but if you're in the mood for a mindless globe-trotting adventure, then Spy ticks all the boxes for an easy-breezy watch.</Review>

            <Review>"Cop Car" has two kids at its center, but don't mistake this taut, wicked little thriller for a children's film.</Review>
            <Review>With his sense of black humor and with a coldly calculating view of a world determined by intransigent laws of physics, Watts recalls the Coen brothers of "Blood Simple."</Review>
            <Review>For the most part... this is what a b-movie should be: lean, mean, and filled with just enough longueurs to be evocative without slowing the pace.</Review>
            <Review>Bacon is super-efficient and Watts maximizes his presence in Cop Car to a frighteningly claustrophobic and creepy factor, ridding every frame of extraneous detail or information.</Review>
            <Review>An impossibly sparse indie thriller with a cast of five and not much more going on that its title suggests - which is precisely why it works.</Review>

            <Review>With a 90-minute running time, Unexpected would fit comfortably, with room for commercial breaks, in a two-hour network time slot. How did it ever find a theatrical release?</Review>
            <Review>Smulders gives one of the most natural performances of her career, and Bean's subtle, strong work announces her as a young actress to watch.</Review>
            <Review>A well-intentioned snooze. ... The script's high point for adrenaline is when Samantha and Jasmine make the impulsive decision to - wait for it - litter.</Review>
            <Review>Except for a bit of contrived conflict that arises toward the end, the connection between these two expectant mothers-who are at vastly different points in their lives-rings with a mutual kindness and compassion.</Review>
            <Review>Thanks to an intelligent script and the performances of Cobie Smulders, Gail Bean and Elizabeth McGovern, the minutiae of everyday life in this small, lovely film will capture your interest.</Review>
            <Review>Unexpected features fine performances from both women and I'd love to see more from newcomer Bean, showing grace and maturity onscreen.</Review>
            <Review>This is a smart, sophisticated piece of storytelling that will please any and all crowds.</Review>
            <Review>Painfully earnest, Unexpected dances around some interesting issues - race, class, poverty, bodily autonomy - without ever grappling with them in any meaningful or dramatic way.</Review>
            <Review>A rare movie about pregnancy that recognizes and engages with the reality that it can be a complicated and confusing process.</Review>
            <Review>So-so drama about pregnant women with very different lives.</Review>
            <Review>Unexpected collapses disappointingly even as it points in an intriguing new direction for its maker.</Review>
            <Review>While Unexpected doesn't actively pursue a greater conversation on race and privilege, or even the state of Chicago's education system, it does spark a conversation.</Review>

            <Review>The film as a whole feels sort of retro as a tawdry cautionary tale.</Review>
            <Review>Lurid and cheesy and sometimes unintentionally funny.</Review>
            <Review>Another cautionary yarn about a political hopeful whose adulterous behavior catches up with him, Mora Stephens' "Zipper" hits a snag from the get-go.</Review>
            <Review>What "Zipper" lacks in depth it makes up in interesting, morally shaded supporting characters.</Review>
            <Review>Mr. Wilson, as dexterous with righteous bravado as with calibrated self-disgust, ably captures Sam's growing enslavement to his impulses.</Review>
            <Review>Zipper takes its sleaze seriously, which isn't quite the same thing as actually caring about it.</Review>
            <Review>[It] plays like one of those sections in certain House of Cards episodes that feel cheap and easy and trashy. For a minute or two it's fun, before it quickly becomes laborious and grating.</Review>
            <Review>None to subtle in its approach, Zipper works only when it wants to.</Review>
            <Review>It's a muddled tale of sexual obsession that's both predictable and ridiculous, although Wilson brings some depth to his performance.</Review>
            <Review>Too much of the feature is devoted to condom unwrapping, not an excavation into the black heart of personal excess.</Review>
            <Review>Zipper is yet another political thriller laced with adultery, but despite Patrick Wilson's surefire performance, it's not a particularly interesting one.</Review>
            <Review>[Zipper is] clumsily structured with poorly drawn characters ... it's ugly, boring, and a complete waste of time.</Review>

            <Review>Director Gil Kenan ruins the pacing with too many half-baked, awkwardly staged horror set pieces, but the cast acquit themselves well enough.</Review>
            <Review>There's little doubt that nostalgia played a part in Fox's decision to remake Poltergeist, but that's a poor reason for any film's existence and no excuse for how uninspired Gil Kenan's re-imagining of this one turned out.</Review>
            <Review>It's not exactly a scary film, but it does provide an enjoyable ride. It's good fun. But it left me befuddled. A little sad. And a little angry.</Review>
            <Review>The original film was promoted with the tagline "It knows what scares you." If there was a truth-in-advertising law regarding films, this movie's ad copy would read: "Poltergeist: Meh."</Review>
            <Review>The new "Poltergeist" might well be the scariest movie 13-or-unders have yet seen, just as the original was for their parents back in 1982.</Review>
            <Review>Poltergeist does benefit from briskness-it's actually 20 minutes shorter than Hooper's film-and there is a nice, Evil Dead 2-esque sequence involving a power drill.</Review>
            <Review>Poltergeist 2015 is too weak to stand up to the original.</Review>
            <Review>'Poltergeist' assembles a very gifted group of people to go through another movie's paces, a cover band you wish would just play their own songs.</Review>
            <Review>It's not a fresh re-telling that takes the story to a new level, but there's enough here that's unnerving to keep horror lovers happy.</Review>
            <Review>The techno-centric storyline does little to separate it from the last decade of subpar horror.</Review>
            <Review>Despite [its] reverential treatment, Kenan and producer Sam Raimi manage to serve up an effective supernatural horror film that's capable of standing on its own feet.</Review>

            <Review>This promising doc fails to capture the Cannon spirit</Review>
            <Review>Hartley's film is consistently entertaining, if somewhat one-note.</Review>
            <Review>"Electric Boogaloo" doesn't tell its story from A to Z, but rather in a digressive, choral fashion that privileges outrageous personal anecdotes over dry historical chronologies.</Review>
            <Review>It is, as per usual for Hartley, a giddy, lightning-paced celebration of cheerfully terrible movies.</Review>
            <Review>Directed with tremendous energy for much of its first half, as Cannon starts to wear out is welcome, so does this documentary.</Review>
            <Review>Clip shows like this are always fun for die-hard movie buffs (including critics), especially in a case like this, when the clips are much more potent than the completed films.</Review>

            <Review>As he did with his previous documentary Not Quite Hollywood: The Wild, Untold Story of Ozploitation! (which made my 10 Best list for 2009), director Mark Hartley compiles ample film clips to help tell the saga.</Review>

            <Review>[Director Mark Hartley] has assembled a lively collection of clips and interviews that gives the Cannon story definition and shape, without stinting on the gratuitous anecdotes.</Review>

            <Review>It's a hilarious, couldn't-make-it-up journey into one of film's strangest chapters.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2015</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>93</Duration>
        <StoryLine>With his execution just 48 hours away, Anthony Porter's life was saved by a Northwestern University journalism class. Their re-investigation of the crime for which he was convicted-a double homicide in a Chicago park-led to the discovery of the real killer, Alstory Simon, whose confession exonerated Porter. If it all sounds too good to be true, it's because, as compellingly argued here, Porter actually is guilty, Simon is an innocent man and both are just pawns in a much larger plan.</StoryLine>

            <Review>"A Murder in the Park," with a whopper of a twist near the end, is often mesmerizing, even as its story remains unfinished. Justice, in this case, seems to remain elusive.</Review>
            <Review>Rech and Kimber make a damning case against Protess as well as the private investigator who helped him incriminate Simon and the attorney who negotiated Simon's guilty plea.</Review>
            <Review>Whatever your feelings on capital punishment, "A Murder in the Park" has a gripping story to tell ...</Review>
            <Review>Besides being a riveting true-crime story ... "A Murder in the Park" is a film that makes a powerful case that some cherished liberal beliefs aren't always congruent with the truth; in fact, sometimes they are the exact opposite.</Review>
            <Review>The filmmakers have skillfully laid out a complex and murky story of crime and justice that, more than 30 years on, continues to scandalize.</Review>
            <Review>This welcome doc of crime and injustice serves as a fleet, compelling inquest ...</Review>
            <Review>A staggering and infuriating expose of advocacy journalism run amok.</Review>
            <Review>[An] explosive, riveting documentary.</Review>
            <Review>Amid such murky, conflicting motives, Hale's Murder in the Park tries to draw a bright line of rectitude where any fair-minded filmmaker -- Errol Morris comes to mind -- would recognize that's an impossible task.</Review>
            <Review>The film is meticulous in presenting its argument...</Review>
            <Review>A Murder in the Park more than convincingly presents what appears to be a gross corruption of justice, but its dry play-by-play is about as compelling as a Wikipedia article.</Review>
            <Review>Rech and Kimber deserve great credit for crafting a searing courtroom presentation with impressive, convincing power, but their procedural coldness leaves the real victim of this travesty off on the sidelines.</Review>

            <Review>Saint Laurent was a truly mythic figure. It's a shame that Bonello's film doesn't do him justice.</Review>
            <Review>Repetitive, repulsive, empty while stuffed with cheap ennui and wholly lacking in either insight or inspiration, "Saint Laurent" is absolutely everything you don't want to see in a biographical film.</Review>
            <Review>Saint Laurent comes across as a prisoner of his own genius, at once compelling and pathetic.</Review>
            <Review>A flamboyant but hollow exercise in glitz and pizzazz, Saint Laurent is a riot of colors, hedonism and nonsense.</Review>
            <Review>Bonello makes good use of mirrors and reflective surfaces throughout the film, all very fitting for a story about a boy as beautiful and as self-absorbed as Narcissus himself.</Review>
            <Review>An unauthorized biopic that dwells in some of the darkest passages of Saint Laurent where his addictions and infidelities are a common thing. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>

        <Duration>94</Duration>
        <StoryLine>The documentary THE GREAT MUSEUM is a curious, witty and humorous peek behind the scenes at a world-famous cultural institution. Director Johannes Holzhausen and his team spent more than two years gathering material at the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. Shot in the attentive style of direct cinema - with no off-screen commentary, no interviews and no background music - the film observes the various processes involved in creating a perfect setting for art. From the managing director to the cleaning services team, from the carriers to the art historians, the staff members at the museum are all interdependent cogs in the same machine.

            <Review>You might be better served by taking your own long, slow walk through the scenes your local museum has set for you.</Review>
            <Review>The film creates a kind of romantic view of the minutiae of running a museum, yet it's barely concerned with the actual artwork housed within.</Review>
            <Review>Art-history and museum nerds will doubtlessly be enthralled by The Great Museum, but Holzhausen's choice of material is often random and wandering.</Review>
            <Review>The ghostliness of the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna derives from an identity crisis, where digitization threatens to eradicate the gallery space.</Review>

        <StoryLine>This deeply stirring documentary by award winning director Mirra Bank and narrated by Academy Award (R)-winner Melissa Leo, THE ONLY REAL GAME illuminates the magic of baseball for people in a remote and troubled place. Once princely Manipur, a strife-torn border state in northeast India, defies armed insurgency, drug trafficking and HIV/AIDS through love of our national pastime. Dreams chase reality when a band of baseball-loving New Yorkers, and two Major League Baseball Envoy coaches, team up with Manipuri men, women and children to "Play Ball." With gifted women and girls among the best players - as well as leaders of peace and justice initiatives - this far away story brings us to the heart of the great American Game, or as Babe Ruth put it, "the only real game in the world."

            <Review>For all its talk of death, The Farewell Party, featuring a terrific ensemble cast, is a story about life. Always honest, graceful and funny it explores with deep compassion its characters familial and romantic relationships.</Review>
            <Review>It's taking a strong stand on the morality of mercy killing, no doubt, but it also acknowledges the precious glory of life. It's a rare film that can smile while studying suffering.</Review>
            <Review>A bittersweet, wryly comic, keenly observed look at senescence from Israeli directors Sharon Maymon and Tal Granit.</Review>
            <Review>The gags in the movie's first half are so unapologetically mordant that I was disappointed to see them dwindle to nothing in the second, as so often happens in stories like this one.</Review>
            <Review>I can't recall any film ever making me laugh and cry in complete comic and dramatic balance like "The Farewell Party."</Review>
            <Review>It never lapses into mawkishness, but remains clear-eyed and compassionate. It's not coldly clinical; instead, the characters are treated with grace and respect.</Review>
            <Review>Power 'Farewell Party' centers on the end of life.</Review>
            <Review>A round film in spite of it's modest production values. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>

            <Review>More disappointing than the film's inertia and amorphousness is its sacrifice of the real-world themes of class, money, corruption, and power. Unable to decide what story he wanted to tell, Téchiné hedges his bets and loses everything.</Review>
            <Review>It has its true-crime fascinations, and, until its misbegotten 30-year flash-forward to Maurice's trial, it has a silky allure of sun-kissed depravity.</Review>
            <Review>'In the Name of My Daughter" is one of those French films that leave you going "huh?"</Review>
            <Review>It's a pleasure to take in the lush settings, to hear the delicately ominous score (by Benjamin Biolay) and to watch these actors circling each other.</Review>
            <Review>A fascinating, suspenseful story about obsessive love, money, the Mafia, and murder.</Review>
            <Review>Tawdry tale gets complex, layered treatment from French master Andre Techine.</Review>
            <Review>Late Téchiné is restrained; late Deneuve is not. The standout performer is Adèle Haenel as the daughter who goes missing: she's a lively wire.</Review>
            <Review>Not even Catherine Deneuve can save this dramatically inert soap opera of corruption and obsession, which does not even resolve its central mystery.</Review>
            <Review>... a desultory mash-up of tones and styles. It doesn't really succeed as either melodrama or mystery. Téchiné's pacing is off and potentially incriminating information is jack-hammered into place.</Review>
            <Review>It lowers the stakes on murder and betrayal to the point where they're about as riveting as a parking ticket.</Review>
            <Review>Tells a lurid, fact-based story in a curiously understated, reticent way...intriguing but emotionally rather dessicated.</Review>
            <Review>Engrossing material, with a very watchable trio.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Tracking two parallel journeys that show how digital media complicates modern love, THE HEART MACHINE explores the evolving relationship between physical and emotional intimacy, isolation in the urban hive, and the seduction of hiding behind a screen. This modern mystery tells the story of Cody (John Gallagher Jr. - HBO's The Newsroom, SHORT TERM 12) and Virginia (Kate Lyn Sheil - Netflix House of Cards, YOU'RE NEXT), who fall in love online, despite the distance between them. Through an interrelated series of events, Cody suspects that Virginia might not actually live in Berlin and may even live in the same city as he does, and seeks to find the truth. THE HEART MACHINE questions love and intimacy in the digital age, and whether you can really trust whom you meet on the internet. (C) FilmBuff</StoryLine>

        <Duration>75</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Featuring in-depth interviews with F.W. de Klerk, former South African president Thabo Mbeki (1999-2008), anti-apartheid activists Father Michael Lapsley and Mathews Phosa, Yasmin Sooka of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Richard Goldstone (who headed the Goldstone Commission investigations into political violence) and many others, filmmaker Nic Rossier explores the fascinating political journey and legacy of this complex figure. Nations mired in conflict and recovering from civil war will benefit from better understanding this flawed, yet ultimately successful political leader that managed to bridge two opposing worlds. Ultimately, The Other Man explores the trajectory of this unique nation and reflects on how the end of apartheid will CONTINUE to shape South Africans and the world for years to come.

            <Review>Rossier allows space for the man's culpability even as he convincingly shows that without de Klerk's involvement, the struggle for black liberation would have been much harder and taken much longer.</Review>

            <Review>An enjoyable documentary, with some painless lessons. And a good heart, too ...</Review>
            <Review>The story of the colony's exile and return feels like a dull sermon, but the animals themselves, with their expressive faces and Moe Howard hairdos, can switch from slapstick to pathos faster than Charlie Chaplin.</Review>
            <Review>"Monkey Kingdom" clocks in at a very digestible 82 minutes and doesn't overstay its welcome. It doesn't monkey around - that's left to the film's subjects, who are more than happy to oblige.</Review>
            <Review>Stick around for the credits to find out how pivotal scenes were shot for this worthy addition to Disney's long tradition of nature family films.</Review>
            <Review>Minor ethical questions do linger... But the higher-level mission here, to engender fascination among young viewers, is well accomplished.</Review>
            <Review>Simplistic, but a charming and child-friendly introduction to our cousins in the wild that no zoo could provide, with a monkey heroine whom kids will cheer.</Review>
            <Review>Disney knows animals, animated and otherwise, and they prove it again with Monkey Kingdom, the company's eighth in its annual series of Earth Day-related films and the best one yet.</Review>
            <Review>The animal antics, shot primarily in Sri Lanka, are splendidly photographed and frequently charming, but it's hard not to notice how desperately the movie tries to anthropomorphize the characters.</Review>
            <Review>Fey's combination of deadpan delivery, comic timing and deep sympathy for all things goofy keeps the narrative part of the film swinging from scene to scene in nimble fashion, but it's the monkeys who rule this kingdom.</Review>
            <Review>It's this up-close-and-personal photography style that makes Monkey Kingdom and the other Disneynature films so effective. It's impossible to watch the results without constantly contemplating the process it took to get the footage.</Review>

            <Review>The fact that Furious 7 is messier than any of the past installments is more than mitigated by its grandeur. "Dom, cars don't fly! Cars don't fly!" Brian yells before its biggest stunt. Furious 7 makes you believe they can.</Review>
            <Review>The director, James Wan, sends cars repeatedly airborne and seems himself to marvel at the results; the movie's real subject is the stunt work, but its stars' authentic chemistry lends melody to its relentless beat.</Review>
            <Review>As zippy, playful and amiably preposterous as the best of the previous models.</Review>
            <Review>"Furious 7" could have come across as ghoulish, but it's not until the very end that we're reminded of Walker's fate, and the filmmakers handle it with taste and respect.</Review>
            <Review>Who would have thought that a series addicted to the high of movement could also summon a solemnity that leaves you moved?</Review>
            <Review>The only grace note in this otherwise determinedly graceless movie is the classy way Walker's exit is handled. To say more is to say too much.</Review>
            <Review>Furious Seven is constructed of clichés ('You do whatever you gotta do') and lines that aspire to be clichés ('There's a billion things that's wrong-but not in this moment').</Review>
            <Review>Gleefully sexist (buttttttts!), stupefyingly loud and heart-hurtingly ridiculous, you at least can't accuse Furious 7 of being boring. Or nuanced, or aware of the basic laws of science. But it sure is angry.</Review>
            <Review>Seven-year itch?</Review>
            <Review>Dom's various vehicles are vehemently put through the wringer in the engine-block-destroying 'Furious 7.' It's like banging your head between two trash can lids, except fun!</Review>
            <Review>Fast 7 delivers exactly what fans want: a high-octane thrillride that's a fitting tribute to its late star.</Review>

            <Review>We're shown so many symptoms that, regardless of which actor is playing the hero, there's little relief from the prevailing grimness, and less sense of a life in full.</Review>
            <Review>When you consider all the ways that "Love &amp; Mercy" could have gone terribly wrong, and how full of life it is in the end (and, yes, of love and mercy), I think the end product is almost miraculous.</Review>
            <Review>Unnerving as it is thrilling, as visually and aurally vivid as it is emotionally harrowing.</Review>

            <Review>The performances are universally great, and the subject matter is captivating.</Review>

            <Review>There's a lot of history packed in here... but director Bill Pohald is just as interested in exploring Wilson's creative process...</Review>
            <Review>Love &amp; Mercy is one of the most convincing depictions of the creative process and the effects of mental illness I've seen in a long time.</Review>
            <Review>It is (among its many virtues) wonderfully not boilerplate.</Review>
            <Review>Love &amp; Mercy is what the title suggests: a biopic that's tender and merciful.</Review>
            <Review>Together, the two timelines of Love and Mercy work in deft harmony, resulting in one of the most fascinating musical biopics in years.</Review>
            <Review>Just as they did in the tumultuous '60s - then again as each of us faced our own upheavals over the decades - the hopeful, tuneful, impeccably harmonized songs of Brian Wilson fade in and save the day, then sail off into a perfect California sunset.</Review>

            <Review>Nearly a century after that black-and-white cartoon short, and 65 years after a "classic" animated feature that missed the mark, Disney finally got Cinderella right -- for now and, happily, ever after.</Review>
            <Review>Cinderella is a wonderfully realized family feature that retains the strengths of its source material while at the same time updating it for today's audiences.</Review>
            <Review>The colors - good lord. They're like nothing you could experience in the real world. Cinderella's behemoth of a ball gown alone is 50 shades of blue.</Review>
            <Review>Some of the supporting players, most resplendently Cate Blanchett as the wicked stepmother and Derek Jacobi as the ailing king, are very fine. The film never soars, though.</Review>
            <Review>I'm all for confection, but this movie takes that too far. Cinderella and the prince look like they belong on a wedding cake.</Review>
            <Review>The new film... is nothing if not a tribute to old-fashioned virtues, of care and craft and modesty, of simple stories well told.</Review>
            <Review>It's such a rote recitation of a story we've heard a thousand times that it's hard to imagine why on earth they're telling it to us again.</Review>
            <Review>When gown (James) meets jodhpurs (Madden) in the pivotal ballroom scene, the chemistry is palpable. In a scene that could have been a large bowl of Edwardian cheese, the two young actors give off plenty of old-fashioned romantic sparks.</Review>
            <Review>Kenneth Branagh's live action adaptation of Cinderella is a delightful rendition, if surprisingly traditional, that honours the classic fairy tale with a sweet, humorous and earnest treatment befitting a Disney film.</Review>
            <Review>The story doesn't work nearly as well in live action, losing the buffer zone of disbelief inherent in Disney's classic animated version.</Review>
            <Review>For better or worse, Branagh has redefined the template for what Disney's princess franchise will look like going forward.</Review>
            <Review>Even allowing that Blanchett wrings a wee bit of actual pathos from the added backstory of her character's bitterness, these performances, like the CG concessions of animated animals, are irritatingly overdone.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>Brice goes a bit too broad at times, but he keeps things just funny and edgy and open enough for "The Overnight" to work.</Review>
            <Review>"The Overnight" isn't much - in fact, it's hardly anything. For what it is, though, it's enough.</Review>
            <Review>Written and directed by Patrick Brice with atypical wit, the film is uncensored and hilariously unpredictable, jumping from one titillating gag to the next with the grace of a tightrope walker.</Review>
            <Review>It's a short film, weighing in at 79 minutes, but that feels about right. You probably wouldn't want to spend a lot more time with these folks, no matter how intriguing their company.</Review>
            <Review>In its best moments, The Overnight deviates from the conventions of a party movie (or "sex comedy," as it has been christened) and veers toward the experimental, the uncanny, the unsettling.</Review>
            <Review>What makes The Overnight work as well as it does is the cast. The performances here are truly fearless and engaging, with Schwartzman and Scott in particular in high gear.</Review>
            <Review>A cross between 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf' and 'Score,' the eyebrow-raising sexual possibilities complimented by real considerations of martial desire and "curiosity."</Review>
            <Review>Brice's film adopts an unusual angle through which to look at adult relationships, and benefits from that, as well as a cast on good form.</Review>
            <Review>Things get weird, and then some, in Patrick Brice's engaging and bizarre comedy.</Review>
            <Review>Together, they have the right proportions of wit and feeling, and their shared escapade is funny and racy without ever trying too hard.</Review>
            <Review>Schwartzman and Scott get top marks for bravery and there are some strong laughs but it feels a bit too much like a middle-class Hangover.</Review>
            <Review>A knock-around sex comedy where the actual act is hardly the point, The Overnight shows that wedded bliss can also be a rough, raunchy trip.</Review>

            <Review>An audacious one-man show-a series of deluded, sometimes charming, often tragic, occasionally frightening monologues delivered by a troubled veteran clearly in the midst of a dissociative crisis.</Review>
            <Review>The film is phenomenally acted, but rarely makes much use of the power of cinema, instead using a device associated more with theater-the one-set location, with a one-man cast.</Review>
            <Review>The careful layering of the experiences and emotions that influence Peter's choices, along with expert massaging of the tension that exists from the start, make Nightingale a sad but satisfying film.</Review>
            <Review>"Nightingale" is overshot to appear more cinematic and underwritten to avoid pomposity, and that's okay. Both decisions are just that: choices to serve the character. Peter would be pleased with how his little film turned out.</Review>
            <Review>It's a performance that gets the writhing interplay of transparency and opacity in a character who has gone beyond the deep end of unhinged narcissism and self-dramatization.</Review>
            <Review>Nightingale is really about David Oyelowo, a magnificent actor with astonishing range who draws viewers deep down into the darkness with his character.</Review>
            <Review>As much as the claustrophobia of watching him alone spinning his wheels reinforces the idea of a man trapped, the story soon runs out of momentum.</Review>
            <Review>It's a film that burrows into an unstable psyche, and nestles there uncomfortably.</Review>
            <Review>Everything about Nightingale is richly expressive and chillingly effective.</Review>
            <Review>David Oyelowo the sole actor, but by most accounts pulls if off.</Review>
            <Review>David Oyelowo delivers an unnerving and unforgettable performance in this nail-biter of a one-man-show.</Review>
            <Review>Nightingale is first an intellectualized puzzle, and a portrait of a man losing his mind a very distant second.</Review>

            <Review>Fans of the cinematic street poet Larry Clark (Kids, Bully) might go for this, though the unexpected moments of dignity and compassion that deepen his characters are in short supply here.</Review>
            <Review>Holmes has a face that reveals everything and nothing. Besides being strikingly photogenic, she's a natural.</Review>
            <Review>All this desperation and squalor reeks of authenticity.</Review>
            <Review>A striking portrait of addiction that doesn't say anything new - drugs are bad, kids - but it leaves a lasting and chilling impression.</Review>
            <Review>It's just a portrait of emptiness, but it feels a lot like the real thing.</Review>
            <Review>Kudos to the Safdies for not sugar-coating or otherwise romanticizing the experience of being an addict, but it is a bummer to watch.</Review>
            <Review>In its own downbeat way, it's a film with spirit and heart.</Review>
            <Review>There's an acrid authenticity to this portrait of the lives of homeless junkies in New York that seeps, pore-deep, into the viewer.</Review>
            <Review>Cautiously recommended.</Review>
            <Review>Despite the achingly raw performances and formal inventiveness, Heaven Knows What struggles as a piece of gripping cinema.</Review>
            <Review>Lasts 90 minutes, but you could happily spend hours in the dangerous company of Harley.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>80</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Peter and Chloe, a young married couple from New York, decide on impulse to take a belated honeymoon on-board a research vessel en route to the icy wastes of Antarctica. Not long into the journey, Chloe begins to feel neglected and betrayed by Peter, who is focused on gathering information for an article he plans to publish on their return about the work of one of their fellow passengers, the whale biologist Roger Payne. After an unforgivable betrayal of trust by Peter, Chloe turns their fledgling marriage upside down by moving into her own room and staking out her independence onboard the ship. Drawing attention to the poles within each of us, the impressionistic story oscillates between the super-confined interiors of the ship and the vast open spaces of Antarctica. In the end, it's not until Chloe and Peter are lost - perhaps literally, perhaps metaphorically - in the Antarctic ice that they discover how essential one is to the other.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Stage director Scott Cohen, here making his debut as a feature filmmaker, places far too much faith in the ability of his actors to elicit and sustain audience interest while improvising their way through the tissue-thin narrative he has provided them.</Review>
            <Review>It's no surprise that first-time director Scott Cohen is a nature photographer by trade: he's made one of the most gorgeous movies you'll see this year.</Review>
            <Review>Not trusting his film's paranoid atmosphere to be sufficient, Mr. Cohen clumsily inscribes his influences.</Review>

        <StoryLine>A band of Romanian freedom fighters pull the crime of the century in this gripping heist film based on an incredible true story. Bucharest, 1959: with anti-Semitism on the rise, a group of Jewish WWII resistance members, led by a police inspector (The Imitation Game's Mark Strong) and an academic (Academy Award-nominee Vera Farmiga), reteam for an audacious act of political agitation. Posing as a movie crew, they hold up the Romanian National Bank by making it look like a film shoot. But what comes next is even more unbelievable when the group is handed down a punishment as outlandish as their crime. Game of Thrones' Harry Lloyd co-stars in this slyly comic satire ripped from the strange-but-true pages of history.</StoryLine>

            <Review>"Closer to the Moon" draws on many of the same facts that appear in "The Great Communist Bank Robbery," but in the service of a less adventurous movie with familiar Western actors, English-language dialogue and badly strained uplift.</Review>
            <Review>From Romania, of all places, comes a breath of fresh air, far above the usual action film Hollywood keeps churning out with pointless abandon.</Review>
            <Review>All the major facts of Moon are historically accurate, but the reasons behind the events remain a bit murky. However, Caranfil's speculations are more than persuasive.</Review>
            <Review>It's always a pleasure to see Mark Strong in a lead role -- too often he's wasted as baddies and bosses. In Closer to the Moon he gets his most interesting part in a while.</Review>
            <Review>The story is so quintessentially Romanian, it had better been made in Romanian, with Romanian actors.</Review>
            <Review>Caranfil's unlikely, odd little film is quietly moving - all the more so because it is true.</Review>
            <Review>It has some moments that effectively convey the weirdness with which it deals; but for the most part it's a missed opportunity, marred by a lack of narrative conviction and tonal cohesion.</Review>
            <Review>Closer to the Moon is an unremarkable reenactment of a remarkable story.</Review>
            <Review>A provocative, darkly comedic, absurdist drama - based on a true story.</Review>
            <Review>Although based on a true story, 'Closer to the Moon' comes across on screen as artificial and befuddling. However, quality production values make it easy on the eyes.</Review>
            <Review>There are a lot of moving moments in this film, and it's to writer-director Nae Caranfil's credit that he's able to tease out the logic in this mostly enjoyable, if a little all-over-the-place, dark comedy.</Review>
            <Review>Caranfil, who's made several previous features in Romanian, struggles throughout to find the right tone, mostly in vain.</Review>

            <Review>The bizarro plot threads, and dippy characters fail to connect in any rewarding way, resulting in a largely unfunny film that proves as repetitive and tedious as the 1971 Philip Glass snippet that provides its entire score.</Review>
            <Review>Dupieux's movie is all script twists, lacking both the naïve wonder of the films to which he pays homage and the inventive sophistication of grand Surrealist fantasy.</Review>
            <Review>A hilarious and increasingly disturbing series of looping, overlapping and interconnected narratives worthy of Flann O'Brien or Diderot ...</Review>
            <Review>The film will only work for you if you expect it not to make sense, and enjoy jokes that go on and on and then suddenly (and repeatedly) jack-knife off a cliff or two.</Review>
            <Review>Each narrative fissure further thwarts meaning. The most you can ask from a movie as nullifying as this one is that it offer wit and visual panache, which it does.</Review>
            <Review>A viewer can't help but take it as an artistic statement, even though nothing-not even the nods to Mulholland Dr.-suggests that Dupieux's motivated by anything more than a hankering to make something weird and funny.</Review>
            <Review>This is what it's like to go insane.</Review>
            <Review>Too bad no one told Dupieux that this pic is a bad idea before he got it green-lighted.</Review>
            <Review>Quentin Dupieux is doing something few other directors manage these days: making ridiculous movies with their own language and tone, utterly odd, yet strangely entertaining.</Review>
            <Review>As a Hollywood satire of zero-budget horror flicks, Reality is never as fresh or savage as its needs to be.</Review>
            <Review>It's more eerie than funny, like looking into a distorted mirror and realizing there might be some truth there.</Review>
            <Review>It's not that the strangeness is any less appealing, but that there's no more urgency to it - Rubber had a killer tire on the loose, and Wrong had a lost dog...[This] lacks that level of drama</Review>

            <Review>Arestrup and Dussollier are mesmerizing as they attack and parry, argue and counterargue. They reminisce about their lives before the war and wax poetic about their families - then engage in battle again.</Review>
            <Review>A little supporting personality could have made the proceedings feel less like a smartly staged character study and more like a wartime drama.</Review>
            <Review>Diplomacy will work for those who appreciate dialogue-based character films in which plot is of secondary importance.</Review>
            <Review>Although we know what happens, Diplomacy keeps up the suspense and pulls off surprises as Choltitz's decision reaches its inevitable ending.</Review>
            <Review>Its minor thrills come not from not knowing what will happen, but from watching the cagey choreography of two acrobatic minds.</Review>
            <Review>If you've had your fill of tony World War II dramas, this probably won't renew your interest in the genre, but the leads are fine as usual and Schlöndorff succeeds in making the stagebound material feel reasonably cinematic.</Review>
            <Review>Gripping little drama shows the fate of Paris in the hands of two men</Review>
            <Review>Diplomacy induces pins and needles from the get-go and doesn't let up until the credits roll.</Review>
            <Review>The drama is made interesting and more substantial as hidden facts about the German's situation are revealed, and his soldier's perspective honored.</Review>
            <Review>You know, after all, what the end result will be, but "Diplomacy" is strong enough to keep the situation intense and important.</Review>
            <Review>We know where this is going, or rather where it isn't; but the fun is in watching the negotiations unfold.</Review>
            <Review>Expanded from Cyril Gely's stage play, this film remains finely focussed on a history-changing dialogue between two men on the day Paris changed hands from the Nazis to the Allies.</Review>

            <Review>A clever concept and stylish execution (in both senses) aren't quite enough to make this achingly meta remake/reboot/sequel stand out from the slasher pack.</Review>
            <Review>The 'American Horror Story' team remakes the cult 1976 slasher with gimmicky, mostly unscary results.</Review>
            <Review>While its tone wildly varies, when it comes to the glut of horror remakes, it's a slight step ahead of the standard batch.</Review>
            <Review>Knowledge of the first film probably helps, but it's a nifty little genre experiment nonetheless.</Review>
            <Review>With its small-town atmospherics, a juicy supporting cast of character players, plus Addison Timlin's personable, plucky "final girl", this Town is pulled off with polished, enjoyable brashness ...</Review>
            <Review>This is an exercise in nostalgia as much as bloodletting. The filmmakers are paying their very own tribute to teen-horror pics of the 1970s.</Review>
            <Review>Not a straight remake of the 1976 cult horror movie, The Town That Dreaded Sundown is more a self-referential homage that takes the original film's legacy and embellishes it.</Review>
            <Review>A straightforward, slickly edited psycho-killer flick with moments of razor-sharp tension and a welcome appearance from Alien star Veronica Cartwright as Timlin's granny.</Review>
            <Review>Those who like their shivers served up with a spattering of grey matter should leave with a sunny disposition.</Review>
            <Review>It's an odd, if somewhat original, way of playing with sequel conventions: the plot exists in a reality where the original film also exists. But outside of knowing winks, this is cookie cutter carnage.</Review>
            <Review>Clever enough, but forgets to be exciting.</Review>
            <Review>A film that bounds towards the cult appeal of those self-reflexive horror classics, but agonisingly doesn't quite stick the landing.</Review>

        <StoryLine>The Age of Adaline ruminates on mortality less compellingly than similarly themed films, but is set apart by memorable performances from Blake Lively and Harrison Ford.</StoryLine>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>Like Adaline, the film gives the sense of being somewhat uncomfortable in 2015, but while the movie makes a case for romanticizing the past, Adaline's story shows the limitations of detaching yourself from the present.</Review>
            <Review>Lively is appealing, natural and often touching.</Review>
            <Review>Harrison Ford's performance is the big surprise in this otherwise wonky, frequently shambling tall tale.</Review>
            <Review>The conceit endows Lively's regal air of distracted superiority with an intermittent pathos, but the director, Lee Toland Krieger, brings no identifiable perspective, and the screenwriters ... hardly tap a century's worth of material.</Review>
            <Review>This is one of those movies that have you wondering: Long before the actors signed up and the locations were chosen and the sets were built and the filming began, how did someone not say, "Um, we have a big problem with this story"?</Review>
            <Review>This is a film that needs Amy Adams's twinkle or Sandra Bullock's nervous stammering. It needs a star with life.</Review>
            <Review>The Age of Adaline is the kind of adult romantic drama that's fallen out of favour, and it at least makes you consider how that is a shame.</Review>
            <Review>The Age of Adaline ends pretty much how you'd expect and takes a little long getting there, but will appeal to those who enjoy their romances delivered with a touch of history, and a little magical realism.</Review>
            <Review>A San Francisco-set fantasy in which [Blake Lively] plays out a Benjamin Button-like existence through some truly awkward romantic situations.</Review>
            <Review>The Age of Adaline is a bold and elegant film that treats its characters with respect and refrains from exploiting its very exploitable premise.</Review>
            <Review>Adaline turns out to be so earnest and genuinely sweet, that one should be able to forgive its schmaltzy excesses.</Review>
            <Review>It's a fascinating Benjamin Button-like premise and Lively shines in the lead, capturing the wisdom and weariness of someone over a century old. But it fails to explore what Adaline has done with her immortal life or the events of the 20th century.</Review>

        <StoryLine>A portrait of Michael White, the enfant terrible of London's theatre-land in the 70's, the man responsible for introducing Yoko Ono, Merce Cunningham and Pina Bausch to the international audiences. He challenged censorship with his hit erotic revue Oh! Calcutta!, struck gold with The Rocky Horror Picture Show and A Corus Line and produced Monty Python and the Holy Grail, My Dinner with Andre, and John Waters' Polyester.

            <Review>The Last Impresario explores how White may sadly be one of the last in the true definition of the term.</Review>
            <Review>White is the 'most famous man you've never heard of' says actress Greta Scacchi, who joins the stars - most of them women - paying tribute in this doc.</Review>
            <Review>The Last Impresario is a highlight reel of highly talented and famous people (John Cleese, Wallace Shawn, Anna Wintour) saying very nice things. This is not a bad thing on its face, but there are limits to how far it can go.</Review>
            <Review>Granted full access, Otto secures face time with dozens of famouses who clearly love him. Yet such praise exposes the film's limitations, with little analysis of White's taboo-busting achievements.</Review>
            <Review>Consistently entertains through its emphasis on amusing anecdotes rather than hard facts.</Review>
            <Review>White makes for a glittering prism through which to view a certain generation of bohemian excess and creativity.</Review>
            <Review>White now is in pretty bad shape and doesn't really possess the mental or physical capacity to engage in long conversations about his life and times.</Review>
            <Review>A fitting tribute to a relatively unknown yet significant and influential player on the West End theatre scene.</Review>
            <Review>This is, above all, a celebration and as such is entertaining, informative and good fun.</Review>
            <Review>The tone is buoyant, upbeat, optimistic and glamorous, as, it appears, White has been all his rather fabulous life.</Review>
            <Review>Warm-hearted, respectful and somewhat melancholic.</Review>
            <Review>A solid, illuminating, entertaining portrait of a highly unconventional producer whose boisterously anti-establishment sensibility allowed him to thrive at a very different, very daring time in pop culture.</Review>

            <Review>Don't let the British pedigree and nostalgic trimmings fool you: this is no Masterpiece Theatre exercise but a broad, high-spirited, riotously funny service comedy, on par with M*A*S*H and Stripes.</Review>
            <Review>A wartime comedy of manners, it's a delightfully whimsical portrait of 1952 England, a time and place of class discord that's both uproarious and politically pointed.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is a sweet-natured, easy-going bit of storytelling, and while Bill may be the central character, Queen and Country is really a movie about England. And it's a love letter to a particular time and place</Review>
            <Review>The director gets all the period detail exactly right and there are plenty of historical and cultural references that evoke a sense of nostalgia.</Review>
            <Review>Queen and Country finds exhilarating comedy in places usually reserved for drama, violence, loss.</Review>
            <Review>In short, [you may realize] how expert presentation can draw you into a world, immerse you in the lives of others, and make you sorry to leave when it's over.</Review>
            <Review>[John] Boorman was 82 when he made the film and his direction is easy and effortless, befitting the story.</Review>
            <Review>Clearly, the film is suffused with unabashed nostalgia, but there are also moments of grace and beauty.</Review>
            <Review>The whole thing exudes a warm, honeyed glow, particularly in those scenes where the women - Bill's mum (Cusack) and the object of his affection, Ophelia (Egerton) - seem to embody the sense of loss and social disruption that imbued the age.</Review>
            <Review>The picture is upfront about being a sequel, but it may play better for those who aren't attached to the original film.</Review>
            <Review>Given how richly his countryman Terence Davies has realized post-war England in movies like Distant Voices, Still Lives and The Deep Blue Sea, the cartoonishness of Queen And Country grates even further.</Review>
            <Review>It's a pleasant, nostalgic movie that didn't need to be made (a memoir written, maybe), chiefly because he has nothing new to say about the postwar era.</Review>

            <Review>American Heist, I want my 94 minutes back.</Review>
            <Review>Despite a few strong emotional beats, the crime drama "American Heist" proves as undistinguished as its generic title.</Review>
            <Review>American Heist has straight-to-video written all over it. Once there, I recommend you skip directly to the last act if you decide to watch it at all.</Review>
            <Review>Adrien Brody and Hayden Christensen work hard in crime drama American Heist but can't muscle beyond average material as yin-and-yang brothers coerced into one last bank job.</Review>
            <Review>Slick but derivative and forgettable on all levels.</Review>
            <Review>A run-of-the-mill crime drama that toes the risibility line on several occasions, even if it's better made than your typical straight-to-video movie.</Review>
            <Review>Hayden Christensen and Adrien Brody turn in solid performances, but this by-the-numbers exercise does little to distinguish itself from any number of better crime thrillers.</Review>
            <Review>Christensen makes a decent Everyman hero and even shows some warmth in his scenes with Jordana Brewster, but their subplot doesn't amount to anything at all. Neither does the movie.</Review>
            <Review>The film offers a veritable smorgasbord of dated, only-in-the-movies clichés about the debt-ridden working class.</Review>
            <Review>American Heist is watchable enough if only for Adrien Brody's erratic, jive talking performance.</Review>
            <Review>The heist itself is not very exciting, which is rather a let-down considering the grand-sounding title.</Review>
            <Review>Not even performances can wake this sleeping film, which is primarily interested in camera placement, not searing storytelling.</Review>

            <Review>Kudos to this bright and breezy half-term Aussie kids flick for realising that competitive paper plane flying can unleash young imaginations.</Review>
            <Review>Paper Planes is a simple reminder in this high-tech age that joy can be found in a plain piece of paper and that, if my paper plane-laden home is anything to go by, old fashioned films like this can still ignite the imagination.</Review>
            <Review>Worthington and Oxenbould strike up a believable father/son dynamic, meaning that you can't help but smile at the inevitably schmaltzy ending.</Review>
            <Review>The melodrama is hokey, the family details bogus (we're supposed to believe that this modern-day 12-year-old's sprightly grandfather flew spitfires in the Second World War), and the competition element as predictable as you'd expect.</Review>
            <Review>Terry Norris steals the show as the irrepressible grandpa who has little intention of putting his rakish fighter-pilot past behind him.</Review>
            <Review>Ed Oxenbould, the talented Aussie child actor also recently seen in The Visit, gives another appealing performance in this otherwise bland and flimsy kids' movie.</Review>
            <Review>It's worth catching on some platform or other if you and the kids are in the mood for some pleasant Oz escapism.</Review>
            <Review>The planes' flight is invariably CGI-assisted, and the resulting comedy is mild, but there is a relaxed, happy atmosphere.</Review>
            <Review>A "nice" film, but no amount of earnest delivery will make the idea of paper planes being treated as an ancient sport not seem ridiculous.</Review>
            <Review>There's a day-dreamy quality to Paper Planes that makes it a pleasure to watch.</Review>
            <Review>Thoughtful, inspired look at grief soars.</Review>
            <Review>where the emotion of the film works best is in Dylan's relationship with his father</Review>

            <Review>We hear plenty of engaging anecdotes, though, taken together, they don't do much to illuminate a subject that has been thoroughly explored elsewhere ...</Review>
            <Review>Are they miserable? No; everyone seems to be having a great time. Are they funny? Um, not so much.</Review>
            <Review>For the most part ... this is a pretty safe discussion about a very unsafe art form. We can only imagine what's in the outtakes.</Review>
            <Review>An evident labor of love and also a work of grating amateurism.</Review>
            <Review>While genial and never dull, the film is all over the place, a classic example of trying to do and say too much.</Review>
            <Review>While there's no single, monumental insight here-no a-ha moment that cracks the code of comedy-there are a ton of stories and opinions that comedy nerds should love.</Review>
            <Review>It's a decent enough film for comedy buffs though there aren't a whole lot of surprises.</Review>
            <Review>Do you have to be sad to be funny? You'll have to sit through a slew of micro-anecdotes and shop talk before you get any answers from this choppy documentary - longer than any decent comic would defer a punchline.</Review>
            <Review>If only he had probed a bit deeper, and widened his scope beyond the predominantly white, male subjects (including our own Rob Brydon, Steve Coogan and Stephen Merchant), this could have been a fascinating film as well as a funny one.</Review>
            <Review>Overall, what we get is a relentless conveyer belt of talking heads, earnestly dissecting their profession.</Review>
            <Review>If comedy is tragedy plus time, is stand-up comedy a kind of higher math used to survive that equation?</Review>
            <Review>With so many subjects, it's obvious the director is going for quantity, but it doesn't work (especially the scenes with Matthew Perry; a funny actor is much different from a professional stand-up). The overall tone feels scattered and self-important.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate/>
        <Duration>102</Duration>
        <StoryLine>A film editor with wooden fingers becomes the prime suspect in a series of gruesome murders in this outrageous homage to the Italian giallo films of the 1970s and '80s. Rey Ciso (co-director Adam Brooks) used to be one of the world's best film editors. But that was before the accident that robbed him of all four fingers on his right hand. Subsequently outfitted with a wooden prosthetic, Rey now toils away editing lurid genre films in Italy. Rey seems to have reached the end up his rope when a sadistic killer begins stalking the cast of the latest film he's editing. Now, Rey must race to prove his innocence to the detective (co-director Matthew Kennedy) who seems to have his number. Meanwhile, should the besieged editor fail to catch the killer soon, he could end up becoming the next victim. Udo Kier, Tristan Risk, and Paz de la Huerta co-star.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Even those who get the joke here may find it wearing thin after a while.</Review>
            <Review>In turning to the giallo with their new film The Editor, an especially mean-spirited horror subgenre, the filmmakers leave an especially bad taste.</Review>
            <Review>The Editor does its best to out-genre the genre, lovingly piling ridiculous complications and demented flashbacks on top of unconvincing dubbing, perfect genre references and plenty of nudity and gore.</Review>
            <Review>It's not as much fun as it should be, and while you can certainly admire the skill of the filmmakers in adhering to giallo conventions, you need to be in a midnight-movie frame of mind to really appreciate this film.</Review>
            <Review>The Editor utilizes purposely horrendous acting, preposterously amusing gore, and downright absurd comedy and assembles every ridiculous fragment into this delightfully brilliant film that somehow works as both a tribute and an uproarious comedy.</Review>
            <Review>The giallo satire we've all been waiting for. All 19 of us.</Review>
            <Review>a knowing pastiche of the giallo genre, so incoherent and ridiculous it could almost pass for the genuine article... felt at times overstretched and perhaps could have done after all with the touch of "the world's greatest editor".</Review>
            <Review>...ultimately a tedious disaster that's consistently unable to justify its feature-length running time...</Review>
            <Review>The Editor is probably the coolest film you'll see this year and one you'll want to partake of again and again and yet again.</Review>
            <Review>The Editor starts off as a pitch-perfect Giallo spoof, but struggles to consistently maintain the same perverse entertainment factor until the film's bloody finale.</Review>
            <Review>A well worked and occasionally well-sustained satire of the wonderfully sleazy Italian murder-mystery melodramas from the 1960s to the '80s ...</Review>

            <Review>Mad Max: Fury Road delivers. There's no clearer or more succinct way to put it. 30 years after last appearing on the big screen, Max roars back with a vengeance.</Review>
            <Review>Even after two viewings, I feel as though I've only scratched the surface of Mad Max: Fury Road. George Miller's action fantasy is astonishingly dense for a big-budget spectacle, not only in its imagery and ideas but in the complex interplay between them.</Review>
            <Review>Believe all the hype: This movie will melt your face off.</Review>
            <Review>I saw it twice and liked it vastly more the second time around, when I'd adjusted my expectations and had my bearings from the get-go. Then it became about digging the spectacle - not to mention the hilarious sexual politics.</Review>
            <Review>An A-plus B-movie that at times feels almost like a tone poem to early-'80s excess, a cross between a monster-truck rally and a Plasmatics concert.</Review>
            <Review>Miller's commitment to things that look cool cannot be overstated. Mad Max Fury Road is a never-ending stream of such things</Review>
            <Review>Those in search of a bludgeoning good time will find it in his new scorched-earth action extravaganza, Mad Max: Fury Road -- it's hard to remember the last time a summer tent-pole movie over-delivered in the ways this does.</Review>
            <Review>Yeah, I get it. I admired the film a lot. But did I love it? Well...</Review>
            <Review>A machine that roars at full throttle for two solid hours.</Review>
            <Review>A fun and thrilling film where Miller doesn't take himself too seriously and allows some humor to appear, like the crazy flamethrower guitar player. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>[Furiosa is] the human touch in this inhumane world and the madly beating heart of this technical wonder of a movie.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Henry (Michael Biehn) and his son, Nathan (Matthew Ziff), are forced to spend time together during the weekend of a their friend's wedding (Jennifer Blanc-Biehn and Richard Gunn). We see very early that their relationship is strained and their time with each other is uncomfortable, but when a storm moves in and the road washes out - secrets are revealed - and the situation heads toward peril. When Henry learns that Nathan plans to quit school and ask his girlfriend, Cecilia (Sarah Butler), to marry him, he expresses disapproval. Nathan isn't surprised, his dad has never approved of his relationship. But we soon learn that Henry's apprehension is based on something far more sinister than fatherly concern. Henry slept with Cecilia during a one night affair. He put the incident behind him, but Cecilia has other ideas and tells Henry that he's the one she wants to be with, and that she plans to end her relationship with Nathan so that the two of them can be together. Henry tries to humor her, in hopes of holding things together through the weekend, but then his girlfriend, Vanessa (Caitlin Keats), let's him in on a secret - she's figured out that Cecilia is pregnant - and Henry is now worried that the baby is his. Nathan is happy when he learns that Cecilia is having a baby, but the guilt proves to much for Cecilia and she confesses that, "There was another guy." Henry has to think quick on his feet as Nathan and Vanessa start putting pieces of the puzzle together, all while Cecilia is trying to convince him to leave his girlfriend and start a happy new life together with her and the new baby - which may or may not be his.</StoryLine>

            <Review>If only "Dior and I" told us why we should care.</Review>
            <Review>Fascinating, suspenseful, illuminating, and ultimately moving.</Review>
            <Review>From creating photo files rather than sketching dresses, to fitting them on lithe human pipe cleaners who march them across the catwalk, the film is a serious look at a business containing surprising amounts of tension.</Review>
            <Review>The movie, not to mention the company, deserves praise for showing the challenges as well as the triumphs; "Dior and I" doesn't shy away from conflicts when they arise. This isn't marketing material. It's a real look at a fascinating line of work.</Review>
            <Review>This undramatic and flat peek "inside" the sewing rooms of Christian Dior holds little in the way of entertainment.</Review>
            <Review>We get to know the people - mostly women, but a few men - whose hands create these intricate, beautiful garments.</Review>
            <Review>The camera follows models and Simons and we do get an inside look into what makes a fashion house stay on top.</Review>
            <Review>It makes for a surprisingly grounded and realistic look at life at House of Dior.</Review>
            <Review>This behind-the-scenes documentary ... has at least proven its worth in capturing a pivotal moment in the Paris fashion house's legacy.</Review>
            <Review>The film's valuable and rare glimpse into the inner workings of a luxury fashion label is something only a small niche of true style nerds will appreciate.</Review>
            <Review>The result is a very human portrayal of an exotic industry and an honest portrait of an accomplished man confronting serious stress with the help of a dedicated team.</Review>

            <Review>Boulevard itself moves toward an obvious conclusion with no surprises along the way; it runs out of steam after about an hour.</Review>
            <Review>While it's all too clear that Nolan is unhappy - he also has an ailing dad to care for - the thoughts inside his head remain stubbornly opaque.</Review>
            <Review>This is certainly a believable story, but it's one we've seen before, and neither screenwriter Douglas Soesbe nor director Dito Montiel has found a way to elevate it into something that challenges or inspires.</Review>
            <Review>Unfortunately, the movie plods; you can always see where it's going or trying to go. It also feels incomplete.</Review>
            <Review>Williams delivers a performance of mannered, sometimes heart-wrenching restraint. But something closer to cautiousness tamps down the film.</Review>
            <Review>Williams does a terrific job portraying Nolan's ambivalence, the mix of fear, guilt, and excitement that grips him and the gradual change he undergoes in the ensuing weeks.</Review>
            <Review>Boulevard is a tender portrait of a man about to shatter an illusion he's created for himself.</Review>
            <Review>[Williams] is enormously likeable as Nolan, a man with secrets that no one is interested in hearing. Baker is an especially strong performer. But all deserve a better script.</Review>
            <Review>This dark, introspective drama hinges on one of Robin Williams' final film performances before his death in 2014.</Review>
            <Review>Like its protagonist, this is an almost painfully shy and unrevealing film.</Review>
            <Review>There is nothing exceptional about Boulevard but it is sincere and Williams invests his character with a touching sense of weary, wistful sadness.</Review>
            <Review>It's a lugubrious, creaky affair, as Williams squishes up his face and droops his shoulders with a coyness that can be downright embarrassing.</Review>

            <Review>Wicked and unhinged.</Review>
            <Review>This supernaturally tinged comedic thriller is far more wickedly clever than most comparable Hollywood offerings.</Review>
            <Review>A fun, dark movie made by the stars and staff of a kids show.</Review>
            <Review>Mostly crass, witless snark, and the fresh-faced, hollow actors don't have the scuzzy charm or fatalistic comic rhythms needed to make this material disreputably fun.</Review>
            <Review>Not entirely horror, comedy, crime, drama or sci-fi, the film nevertheless fuses aspects of each genre, gleefully relishing its own utter ridiculousness and in the end creating something difficult to properly categorise, but impossible to ignore.</Review>
            <Review>Things start deceptively slow, but stick with it as the smart humor and story turns become more and more engaging and enjoyable.</Review>
            <Review>There's an originality to Blood Punch you can only find in film every so often. Unfortunately it just doesn't get a chance to blossom into something as beautiful as you hope.</Review>
            <Review>Blood Punch is aggressive, intelligent, and utterly demented - the kind of time-traveling shenanigans that genre fans are going to love.</Review>
            <Review>This is a crime, drug, dark-comedy, romance, horror, and science fiction thriller. There are far too few of those around.</Review>
            <Review>It's like a supernatural film noir on meth, with heaps of dark humor and a madcap edge that cuts deep. And as its name suggests, Blood Punch is a very, very bloody affair.</Review>

            <Review>A contrived but weirdly compelling thriller involving a tortured hitman, his willing prey, and the inexplicable curse that keeps them both from realizing their shared goal.</Review>
            <Review>The final Act O'Twists, which almost anyone will see coming from very far away, lets down the character work that preceded it and the whole piece sinks just a bit too far into the melodramatic muck ...</Review>
            <Review>"Suicide Theory" does boast a couple of intriguingly complex characters, however, and some interesting points on how little satisfaction is derived from retribution, especially when what goes around reliably comes around.</Review>
            <Review>It sounds preposterous, and much of the movie is over the top, but the energy of the actors carries it for long stretches.</Review>
            <Review>Its faults aside, The Suicide Theory is a truly touching story about our need for human contact. It's strange, goofy, surreal, and deeply gratifying.</Review>
            <Review>the Australian neo-noir thriller The Suicide Theory is a smartly written and satisfying take on the hitman genre featuring a standout performance from Steve Mouzakis.</Review>
            <Review>Guilt, grief, and forgiveness get wrapped up in a Twilight Zone-ish shroud of fate in this downbeat trifle of a crime drama.</Review>
            <Review>The Suicide Theory is an intriguing and original examination of life, death, longing, and inescapable fate.</Review>
            <Review>A compelling, occasionally intriguing crime thriller that's refreshingly grounded in humanism, but it loses its emotional footing during its twisty third act.</Review>
            <Review>Some provocative ideas swirl around this low-budget Australian thriller but never jell into a suspenseful finished product.</Review>
            <Review>Although The Suicide Theory is rarely dull, it lacks the emotional precision required to elevate it above merely an amusing concept.</Review>
            <Review>Though the set-up sounds insufferably gimmicky [...] Michael Kospiah's screenplay for The Suicide Theory is a tight, thoughtful piece of work.</Review>

            <Review>The tone is uneven, creaking between uproarious comedy bonking and serious(ish) drama.</Review>
            <Review>If the film moved along quicker and found a better mix of irony and sadness, it would have been a charming treat. But all the ingredients fail to make a tasty pain au chocolat.</Review>
            <Review>Director Anne Fontaine eroticizes her porcelain-skinned star but also adds some subversively feminist flourishes.</Review>
            <Review>Like Chabrol, Fontaine has a way of making you laugh, on an off, for 90 minutes, before leaving you feeling a little queasy from too much truth.</Review>
            <Review>A nice little gem for anyone intrigued by the concept of having fun with a giant of 19th century literature.</Review>
            <Review>The novel, of course, is one of the towering achievements in literature, and this trivial movie has no idea what to do with it.</Review>
            <Review>A modern day comedy that parodies in an obvious and kinda sloppy way the literary classic Madame Bovary. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>A wickedly droll film that saunters towards its Flaubertesque end with a strangely carefree but knowing vibe.</Review>
            <Review>From Anne Fontaine, writer/director of Coco Before Chanel, comes this lighthearted and lusty modern-day interpretation of Posy Simmonds' graphic novel based on Gustave Flaubert's 19th century novel, Madame Bovary.</Review>
            <Review>Gemma Bovery proves that just because you know a story, maybe even how it ends, that doesn't mean it is not worth hearing from the mouth of a new teller.</Review>
            <Review>A heavily eroticised Arterton enlivens the lumpy Franglais dialogue and Luchini wrings laughs from the unlovely vantage of voyeuristic saddo. But that's not enough to hold the film together, or, indeed, the viewer's interest.</Review>
            <Review>Fontaine's film isn't as slyly satirical as Simmonds' original, but her rural locations and leading lady are equally ravishing, and the frisky rapport between Arterton and Lucchini is a joy.</Review>

            <Review>Gameau ... inserts a bit of journalism into the mix with two road trips that elevate "That Sugar Film" beyond a semi-vanity production.</Review>
            <Review>While "That Sugar Film" is filled with powerful and what should be downright alarming information, it also suffers from distracting bouts of cinematic candy coating.</Review>
            <Review>The food-doc shelf is crowded with good-for-you movies, including "Fed Up," "Fast Food Nation," "Food Inc." and, yes, "Super Size Me." "That Sugar Film" is a worthy addition, entertaining while informing.</Review>
            <Review>Gameau, like a certain beloved British nanny, recognizes the value in a spoonful of you-know-what helping the medicine go down.</Review>
            <Review>Peppy and eager to please, this relentless Australian documentary takes a strange approach to early death and unnatural appetites.</Review>
            <Review>Fun to watch, if a little too cutesy for my tastes.</Review>
            <Review>It will change the way you read food labels and detain your trolley in the produce aisle where it's safest.</Review>

            <Review>Andrew Mogel and Jarrad Paul, making their directorial debut, manage the difficult task of keeping the audience engaged even though both of the main characters are unlikable.</Review>
            <Review>"The D Train" may be a scant and rather unconvincing comedy, but it deserves credit for taking a risk.</Review>
            <Review>Nothing about "The D Train" feels the least bit authentic, and worse, little about it is funny. That's a deadly recipe for a dark comedy.</Review>
            <Review>The last act of The D Train becomes a hilarious, deeply weird, and ultimately touching medley of delusion, humiliation, and friendship.</Review>
            <Review>The movie goes for grin-and-cringe-inducing, and instead achieves "excruciating."</Review>
            <Review>The movie flirts with a great darkness about disillusionment and self-loathing even as it races around spinning comedic plates. Too bad the filmmakers lose their nerve by film's end.</Review>
            <Review>A disappointing dark comedy.</Review>
            <Review>The introduction of too many ill-conceived sub-plots fails to enhance or execute the essential tenets of the narrative, only serving to detract and distract from the film's overall philosophy, lacking the sharp, subversive edge required for black comedy.</Review>
            <Review>As fresh and well meaning as it is problematic, taking a new comedy staple - the bromance - and flipping it upside down.</Review>
            <Review>Woefully bad feint at a dramedy in which everyone agrees the 'hero' is a terrible excuse for a man... and he gets the message that he is awesome anyway.</Review>
            <Review>The D Train is an original take on the clichéd reunion story we've seen so many times before, but it's not for the faint of heart. This is an intelligent, dark comedy with a hard R rating.</Review>
            <Review>Overall, The D Train is a wacky, welcome and very funny surprise.</Review>

            <Review>I hope Temple finds a way to stick around until such time as she figures out where she fits in best and what she's best at. When that happens, she is gonna lay waste.</Review>
            <Review>Given that we've seen this story before and didn't like it then, Safelight should perhaps just be called "safe".</Review>
            <Review>Following a by the numbers "Abused and downtrodden young couple finds a modicum of happiness in a cruel world through their affection for each other" premise, "Safelight" is about the friendship and the inevitably blossoming romance.</Review>
            <Review>An attractive cast can't rescue this well-meaning but slow, sappy romantic triangle.</Review>
            <Review>Safelight would be better titled Lightweight.</Review>

            <Review>Avoids the obvious, delivering a bittersweet observational drama which pulls the heartstrings.</Review>
            <Review>[Danner is] clearly having a ball with this character.</Review>
            <Review>A touching, funny and thoughtful film that trades in honesty rather than artifice.</Review>
            <Review>I'll See You in My Dreams is delicate and nuanced, with writing that rejects, or at least reshapes, the cliches of movies about people facing the glare of their sunset years.</Review>
            <Review>The film cleverly uses the conventions more typical of romantic comedies several decades its junior ...</Review>
            <Review>Danner is probably the main reason to see the movie, and her screen presence is impressive; she's an actor who manages to bring gravitas to any role, and that includes her work in goofy things like Ben Stiller's Meet the Parents series.</Review>
            <Review>Co-writer and director Brett Haley, with his second feature, achieves something very warm-hearted and appealing despite low stakes, thanks to a special performance from his lead.</Review>
            <Review>Touching, and warm and earnest in its conviction .</Review>
            <Review>Blythe Danner has been acting for half a century but she has rarely had a part as good as Carol in I'll See You In My Dreams.</Review>
            <Review>Corny for certain, but very charming to boot.</Review>
            <Review>It's light touches all around, with everybody seeming to have gotten the emotional availability memo.</Review>
            <Review>I'll See You In My Dreams assembles some very fine performers and gives them almost nothing to do. It's aimed at the people who flock to those Best Exotic Marigold Hotel movies but want an even less challenging narrative.</Review>

            <Review>Lost After Dark is an intriguing attempt to recreate the style of a slasher straight out of the 80s, and while it does mostly succeed in this attempt, unfortunately it falls right in with the downright bad entries of the period.</Review>
            <Review>A loving homage that is all sincere, no snark. It does break the rules for some clever twists, but it's never making fun of horror movies. It's celebrating them in a way that shows we don't have to give this style up.</Review>

            <Review>Emotional and intimate.</Review>
            <Review>It's a rare, intensely personal look at Alzheimer's that will be tragically familiar to those who have lived with it and sobering and sad for those who have not.</Review>
            <Review>One of Glen Campbell's final songs was Not Gonna Miss You, dedicated to his wife. I can't imagine anyone listening to it and not being moved.</Review>

            <Review>Director Keach places his cameras so that you feel like you are part of the film.</Review>
            <Review>As a salute to a musical master, I'll Be Me does Glen Campbell justice. And as a rallying cry for the fight to end Alzheimer's, it's potent.</Review>
            <Review>The film includes vignettes of the more than 100 concerts in that goodbye tour, all of which serve as vivid and painful images of the downward spiral that is Alzheimer's.</Review>

            <Review>Backcountry thrives in the close-quarter details: the verbal knife-pricks of a dying relationship, the jangling impact of the smallest sounds breaking silence, that dread certainty that you're completely lost and it's getting dark.</Review>
            <Review>MacDonald does quite well in his dramatic feature debut with solid performances from the cast. Backcountry is satisfyingly intense, although quite gory in patches.</Review>
            <Review>"Backcountry" inevitably brings on the bloody, but it finds atmospheric ways to depict how the bucolic hush of a nature getaway can morph into a survival nightmare for the unprepared.</Review>
            <Review>A couple of weekend backpackers face off against man and beast in director Adam MacDonald's accomplished, blunt-force wilderness adventure.</Review>
            <Review>It's beautifully tense and well-acted - the kind of modest genre picture we don't see enough of these days.</Review>
            <Review>Apparently inspired by a true story that the movie made me very much not want to look up, which I suppose may be taken by some to be a token of its effectiveness.</Review>
            <Review>Backcountry ultimately feels like a short film that's been clumsily expanded to a feature-length running time.</Review>
            <Review>Backcountry will make some think twice about going into the woods for vacation.</Review>
            <Review>The film's main source of anxiety remains the lone, terrified figure, thoroughly unprepared for the savage beast who attacks, and faced at last by an uncaring natural world.</Review>
            <Review>MacDonald does a nice job of building up to an emotional finale that doesn't betray his dedication to brutal realism.</Review>
            <Review>Given that most killer bear movies are either intentionally cheesy or unwittingly inept, it's nice to see a new one that takes the concept seriously and forgoes easy splatter in favor of some strong, simple, sustained suspense.</Review>
            <Review>Sometimes you eat the bear, sometimes the bear eats you, as the philosopher Sam Elliott said. Backcountry succeeds by not straying far from that core belief.</Review>

            <Review>Good Kill excels as a character study with Niccol's screenplay making Egan a fascinatingly conflicted and flawed individual and Ethan Hawke giving one of his best recent performances bringing the man to life.</Review>
            <Review>But the visuals pack a visceral punch. Every time Tom zeroes in on a target, every time he pushes that button, what we see on those monitors is brutally authentic.</Review>
            <Review>"Good Kill" is darkly enlightening, but it's not really all that good.</Review>
            <Review>The audience seems likely to leave feeling scolded or pandered to, depending. Not a great time.</Review>
            <Review>"Good Kill" wants to use the movies as a Trojan horse to confront us with our international sins. It's a worthy effort, even if it's not a very well-built horse.</Review>
            <Review>Thoughtful and immensely gripping ...</Review>
            <Review>This isn't science fiction-it claims to be "based on actual events"-but it feels like it, with its sealed, space capsule-like remote cockpits and disconnection from the field of battle...</Review>
            <Review>Ethan Hawke has become a better actor with time and his work with Noccol is probably some of his best. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Like many a previous Niccol work, Good Kill is a human drama about a man hurled into a technological future no one could anticipate: a world in which we humans have come up with yet another ingenious way to torment ourselves.</Review>
            <Review>The film quickly loses its way and, after the initial engagement, things simply trail off, and the film doesn't deliver the strong climax it promises.</Review>
            <Review>Niccol's aim is single-minded and relentless.</Review>
            <Review>Remote, relentless and lacking the human touch. That's a description of drones that could also be applied to this Ethan Hawke movie.</Review>

Her unemployed, alcoholic husband has secretly spent their mortgage payements on booze, and now the bank is threatening to auction off the house where they live with their young daughter. The agency where she translates legal documents to English for extra cash is going under and unable to pay her what she's due, and a thief in her class has stolen the last few dollars out of her purse. With few options left, she solicits help from a local loan shark who is happy to give her what she needs at a steep price. With the reposession looming, Nade will resort to measures her former self, untouched by the realities of economic desperation and moral compromise, would have found depraved, as she makes one last extreme effort to secure the money she needs.

            <Review>The kinetic yet poker-faced filmmaking renders the narrative turns especially jolting.</Review>
            <Review>The talented Margita Gosheva grippingly plays an assertive, hardworking, honest heroine, but that's all she'll do here. Following her static, white-knuckled strain is compelling but not exactly a delight.</Review>
            <Review>It's akin to watching someone get their knuckles cracked by a ruler, over and over again.</Review>
            <Review>The script's mordant humor only makes Nade's situation feel more bleak.</Review>
            <Review>A precisely paced, nightmarish thriller.</Review>
            <Review>A spare, stripped-to-essentials drama about economic stress and mounting desperation that should resonate with a wide range of international audiences.</Review>
            <Review>Gosheva dominates the screen, her expressive face leading us through a minefield of conflicting emotions toward battle-hardened resolve.</Review>
            <Review>The suspense is superbly maintained as the excellent Gosheva struggles to stay on her pedestal.</Review>
            <Review>The Lesson takes a simple, and hardly extravagant premise and somehow constructs, out of this initial set-up, a gripping, increasingly desperate, and often wildly intense narrative rollercoaster.</Review>
            <Review>There's an awful fascination to this bleak movie from Bulgarian writer-directors Petar Valchanov and Kristina Grozeva, whose feature debut has something of the deadpan drear and social satire of the new Romanian cinema.</Review>
            <Review>Young Bulgarian directors Kristina Grozeva and Petar Valchanov have made a tight, bleak, suspenseful drama in The Lesson, driven by a commanding, unforgiving performance from actress Margita Gosheva.</Review>
            <Review>A quietly compelling Bulgarian drama that views the age of austerity through the tragic dilemmas of one victim.</Review>

            <Review>Bessie shows us an assortment of moments from that life but doesn't really make us feel it, despite Queen Latifah's best efforts.</Review>
            <Review>It fleshes out Bessie Smith to a degree but certainly not in full measure. Latifah and Rainey can sure sing out, though. It's a pleasure to watch and hear them wail in a film that otherwise doesn't quite cut it.</Review>
            <Review>Well-made biopic absent a whole lot of music and -- as a result -- much emotional resonance.</Review>
            <Review>Bessie isn't a perfect movie. But for HBO's purposes, it's a big-time noisemaker - one with the kind of show-stopping work that, when they start handing out trophies, isn't likely to leave its star singin' the blues.</Review>
            <Review>Bessie boasts powerful performances and a chance to hear the early blues popularized by Smith and her mentor, Ma Rainey.</Review>
            <Review>A thoughtful and at times stirring example of how a film can add texture to a legendary figure.</Review>
            <Review>Gritty biopic has sex, violence, drinking, great music.</Review>
            <Review>Presents the powerhouse vocalist as a blues belter in more ways than one -- a pugnacious scrapper with a fierce streak of racial pride, a sexual appetite that crossed gender lines and a hair-trigger temper that sometimes served her well...</Review>
            <Review>... give Bessie a try ... to see Queen Latifah's performance and learn a bit about Bessie Smith's life and times, and turn in off if and when it starts to drag.</Review>
            <Review>The story is so intent on covering the title character's life almost in its entirety that character motivations suffer.</Review>
            <Review>"Bessie" knows all the right words, but hasn't quite learned how to sing them just yet.</Review>
            <Review>Bessie is remarkably poignant, even if that resonance is somewhat disreputable.</Review>

            <Review>Director/writer Mel Rodriguez III, making his feature-film debut, upends expectations with a surprisingly engrossing look at two people who stumble their way toward one another.</Review>
            <Review>In real life, things matter to people. Who you fall in love with matters. Your career matters. Your friendships matter. In "In Stereo" nothing really matters.</Review>
            <Review>There's no reason for the time-twisted storytelling: It serves only to leave us on unsteady ground and suspicious of our protagonist.</Review>
            <Review>What ensues is a dark, manic farce, as much about the destructive things we do to those we care most about as it is a cautionary tale for love-seekers in their thirties.</Review>
            <Review>The fun possibilities get squandered, and we are treated to a head-scratching ending that is more befitting of "All My Children" than a feature film.</Review>
            <Review>This is a tedious modern romance that thinks it's spouting universal truths when it's actually as myopically narcissistic as the two leads.</Review>
            <Review>Director Mel Rodriguez III provides slick visuals and an even slicker soundtrack, but it doesn't hide the fact that the conclusion of In Stereo is that it's really hard when two gorgeous women want you.</Review>
            <Review>The actors create convincingly unpleasant characters, with Hauptman particularly effective -- but it's a dubious achievement.</Review>
            <Review>In Stereo... is a funky New York-set romp... The film's writing is sharp, its performances are very good, and it has a boss-ass soundtrack. It ain't When Harry Met Sally..., but who gives a f%#k?</Review>
            <Review>... strains to offer insight into contemporary relationships, yet the leads are self-absorbed and obnoxious, leaving moviegoers with little rooting interest in whether they wind up together or apart.</Review>
            <Review>The characters and their problems are not worth their 90 minutes on screen.</Review>
            <Review>The film isn't remotely funny or insightful enough to justify spending an hour and a half in such intensely disagreeable company.</Review>

            <Review>Inside some bad movies, there's a good one, fighting to get out. Inside Broken Horses there's just another bad movie.</Review>
            <Review>[A] weirdly baroque modern-day Western that, while it boasts undeniably imaginative visual and plot flourishes, is far too absurd to take seriously.</Review>
            <Review>Mr. Yelchin's character looks somewhat at a loss about what goes on here, and who can blame him, especially when he visits the former music teacher who has lost his legs in a run-in with the bad guys and now lives in a house warmed by a flaming barrel.</Review>
            <Review>While Chopra attempts to crack the American market with a slice of cinematic apple pie, he holds up a mirror to how Hollywood's tried-and-true narrative of vigilantism connotes who we are, at home and overseas.</Review>
            <Review>There are secrets and revelations in "Broken Horses," none of them revealing.</Review>
            <Review>This wan crime drama plays like the equivalent of a Hindi novel that's been run through Google Translate. Everything feels rudimentary and slightly awkward, though it's possible to discern how the material might once have been powerful.</Review>
            <Review>It's hard to tell if the film is an unfunny joke or an earnest failure, but ham-fisted symbolism and sloppy plotting rule regardless.</Review>
            <Review>Despite the solid performances by the cast, it's an overwrought story that is more bleak than beautiful.</Review>
            <Review>[Director] Vidhu Vinod Chopra seems bent on outdoing No Country for All Men at all costs, which unfortunately include plot plausibility and a sustainable dramatic tone.</Review>
            <Review>Broken Horses lays on the heavy-handed symbolism so thick that every action is freighted with significance that the flimsy cardboard cutouts populating it can't support.</Review>
            <Review>Good-hearted but daft, Broken Horses aims for profundity and hits risible.</Review>
            <Review>[It] has a couple of effective scenes of coiled-up tension and suitably moody chiaroscuro work by cinematographer Tim Stern, but it always feels like a very early draft of the story that eventually became Chopra's professional zenith.</Review>

            <Review>The writer and director, Keith Miller, establishes engaging characters but stifles their thoughts and emotions, sets up dramatic situations but avoids their practicalities and implications.</Review>
            <Review>It's eye-opening to see an indie approach to this genre.</Review>
            <Review>Keith Miller's Five Star makes its nonactors look like trained thesps and (in a good way) vice versa.</Review>
            <Review>Slow and steady, and with remarkable assuredness, Keith Miller's "Five Star" plays mean-streets drama in the lowest of keys.</Review>
            <Review>There's just not enough meat on these bones, and what meat there is has been thoroughly chewed over.</Review>
            <Review>Keith Miller's modest drama Five Star is the kind of depiction the city sorely needs.</Review>
            <Review>Because of the heavy use of tropes, the documentary style and genre subversion are not enough to make Five Star feel urgent or authentic.</Review>
            <Review>Five Star has the power to make anyone appreciate the life they have, and think about what it really takes to be a man.</Review>
            <Review>Intimate, engaging and engrossing look at New York gang life and the charisma that it takes to bring in new recruits</Review>
            <Review>It's consistently compelling, and develops a tension that doesn't feel forced, despite being rough around the edges.</Review>
            <Review>The verisimilitude is a poke at the cliche-riddled work seen on television crime shows, but its lack of stylisation and mundane focus can leave you thirsting for, if not some drama, at least a tad more pizzazz.</Review>
            <Review>Writer/director Keith Miller has made a film that never feels forced, never seems artificial. James "Primo" Grant is electrifying in the lead role.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2015</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>104</Duration>
        <StoryLine>In his first film in nearly fifteen years, the director of HENRY: THE PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER harks back to the depravity that made his 1986 debut a horror milestone. But less based in reality, THE HARVEST is closer to a fairy tale from Grimm's darkest corners. Maryann (an impressive Natasha Calis) moves in with her grandparents after she's orphaned. Desperately lonely, the preteen sets out to befriend a neighboring deathly ill, bed-ridden boy (Charlie Tahan), despite the outright disapproval of his mother (Samantha Morton). Maryann's persistence pays off, however, and during a series of secret visits she gradually uncovers some seriously sinister goings-on in the house... Morton as the boy's overprotective surgeon mom is the stuff of great screen villainy-at once utterly monstrous and tragically desperate-so much so that she makes even frequent heavy Michael Shannon, as the more subdued dad, pale in comparison.

            <Review>At its creepiest, "The Harvest" plays like something ripped from the section of a community newspaper devoted to all things rural and weird.</Review>
            <Review>A smart and strong genre work that makes up for a relative lack of gore and viscera with plenty of tension and suspense and a number of impressive performances.</Review>
            <Review>There may be little to give you the collywobbles, but there's quite a lot to enjoy, with Ms. Morton heading the list.</Review>
            <Review>Nothing wrong with a little gore as long as the result is a few goosebumps. This one is no scarier than running out of ink in the middle of a midterm exam.</Review>
            <Review>I'm not sure stronger hands could prevent this script from going as far into melodrama as it does.</Review>
            <Review>It's worth a look, though, just don't expect big scares or a particularly new plot.</Review>
            <Review>It's not perfect, but The Harvest earns a few points for ambition.</Review>
            <Review>There's a bit of a David Cronenberg vibe to the proceedings - like him, McNaughton is often lauded as a "master of horror" even as both seem more interested in chilly human relationships than buckets of gore.</Review>
            <Review>eschews cheap scares and "boo" moments in favor of constant psychological pressure</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately, peppered with unresolved metaphors, The Harvest is a thriller without tension, a horror that doesn't scare.</Review>
            <Review>'Secret Garden' meets 'Misery,' anyone? McNaughton's first feature in too long has much to recommend it, including a deceptively bucolic setting and a shriek-worthy performance by Morton. 'No wire hangers, EVER!'</Review>
            <Review>The primary horror in 'The Harvest' comes from watching the superlative talents of Michael Shannon and Samantha Morton wasted on such secondary swill.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Our Man In Tehran is an in- depth, intimate exploration of the true story behind Ben Affleck's Oscar- winning film ARGO. In this gripping new documentary, the story of the "Canadian Caper" is told by the man who knows it best: Ken Taylor, Canada's former ambassador to Iran, who hid the six Americans in his official residence and obtained the counterfeit documents that allowed them to make their dramatic escape from Tehran. Based on Robert Wright's book, the film uncovers new information and adds valuable context, including an historical overview of Iran, interviews with the rescued Americans, former Prime Minister Joe Clark, ex-CIA officer Tony Mendez, and many others.

            <Review>Informative but tedious ... for anyone who watched Argo and then wished to hear a ditzy, history-obsessed uncle ramble about the real-life political stakes of the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis.</Review>
            <Review>This polished, comprehensive-feeling film makes clear how much of the work was done by our neighbors to the north.</Review>

            <Review>The story's a good one (already familiar if you saw Argo), and it's interesting to see the real-life versions of characters portrayed by Ben Affleck, etc.</Review>
            <Review>Luxuriating in the sort of complexity that streamlined films have a difficult time fitting into the confines of a cathartic narrative, Our Man in Tehran is a worthwhile complementary piece to Argo.</Review>
            <Review>...the biggest problem of Our Man in Tehran is also what ultimately befalls Argo.</Review>

            <Review>"Animals" is a stark, brilliant, uncompromising, beautifully acted piece of work.</Review>
            <Review>The couple's doomed romance feels familiar from numerous other films about addiction, and the movie is downright bad whenever it aspires to visual poetry.</Review>
            <Review>This is not a "slippery slope" movie, like other stories about addicts. In "Animals," they are already at the bottom of the slope.</Review>
            <Review>It's gritty and grim, but "Animals" is also a gripping portrait of young junkies in love.</Review>
            <Review>The trajectory of "Animals" is obvious in the opening minutes of this numbing if well-acted junkie drama.</Review>
            <Review>Mr. Schiffli shoots in a fluid style, tweaking colors and focus to register changes in perception and feeling.</Review>
            <Review>It hits enough unexpected notes, both of damnation and redemption, that it stands above most of its contemporaries in the subgenre.</Review>
            <Review>Homeless con artists ply their trade in petty crime survival saga.</Review>
            <Review>What separates Animals from its twitchier brethren is a keen sense of place.</Review>
            <Review>Has confidence and authenticity to spare.</Review>
            <Review>This kind of movie can boost the fortunes of little-known actors, and it should do that for Dastmalchian and Shaw.</Review>
            <Review>There's no shortage of indie pictures that burrow into the cold realities of drug dependency. But "Animals," like the best of these films, moves beyond mere cautionary tale.</Review>

        <Duration>100</Duration>
        <StoryLine>An enormously powerful portrait of a once-mighty steel town eviscerated by the closure of its factories, Gabriella Kessler and Jean-Lo�c Portron's BRADDOCK AMERICA is both a finely detailed investigation into a specific community and a reflection on the fate of so many similar towns throughout the United States. Part of a recent wave of documentaries about disaster-stricken, post-industrial American cities, BRADDOCK AMERICA distinguishes itself by the degree of its commitment and its refusal to fetishize urban ruin. It features archival footage of Braddock in its heyday, fly-on-the-wall observation of city council meetings, protest gatherings, police patrols, and other aspects of the town's daily life, and most importantly, expansive interviews with Braddock's residents. Their unapologetically emotional, remarkably candid testimony makes BRADDOCK AMERICA an unforgettable document of post-industrial America. (C) Anthology</StoryLine>

            <Review>The film rewards the patient, with the most compelling entries stacked in the back half.</Review>
            <Review>If nothing else, The Turning is probably value for money. Quantity counts for something, after all, as do good intentions. But they can't ever fully satisfy.</Review>
            <Review>Winton is important to Australian culture, but a less fragmented, reverent approach would serve his work better.</Review>
            <Review>The films are rich and diverse, moving from the warm humour of Cate Blanchett reconnecting with her mother-in-law to a battered Rose Byrne having visions of Jesus.</Review>
            <Review>Life-changing moments feature in each of the nine short films in this Australian anthology, and each is told with remarkable artistry and sensitivity.</Review>
            <Review>The cream of Australian acting talent features in this portmanteau picture, based on interlinking short stories by Tim Winton.</Review>
            <Review>The Turning is a collection of nine short films based on Tim Winton's stories, some of which are more satisfying than others but in all they give a sense of Australian landscape and life at the edges.</Review>
            <Review>It was first conceived as an art project, and is perhaps best viewed that way.</Review>
            <Review>Even at the level of the individual short film it looks disconcertingly unfinished and unformed, each piece seeming like a sketch for something bigger.</Review>
            <Review>There's much to admire in this compilation of Australian short films, but the run-time is far too punishing.</Review>
            <Review>The stories and their themes are depicted as Joycean-style epiphanies or meditations on being and time.</Review>
            <Review>An adaptation of Australian author Tim Winton's 2005 collection of short stories, The Turning is a beguiling piece of storytelling.</Review>

        <Duration>86</Duration>
        <StoryLine>A chance meeting in the middle of Lake Michigan forces two desperate strangers, each on the brink of disaster, to confront their worst fears in The Surface. Mitch (Sean Astin) begins this day with a visit to his mother, confined to a nursing home with dementia, before motoring out to sea in his late father's 70's era boat for a journey to the center of Lake Michigan. As he settles in for what he envisions as a solitary final ride, Mitch's vessel collides with the wreckage of a small plane, knocking off his propeller and stranding him in the midst of the vast body of water. As the tiny boat drifts, Mitch discovers Kelly (Chris Mulkey), the plane's pilot, still clinging to the debris, and pulls the severely injured man out of the water. Instead of being grateful, Kelly is angry and suspicious, treating his rescuer like an adversary and aggressively protecting a mysterious backpack. Out of cell phone range and taking on water, the two men begin to reveal their real reasons for being on the lake that day. As they confront the secrets and sorrows that brought them there, they find inspiration in one another's struggle to survive. (C) eOne</StoryLine>

            <Review>"The Surface" has such fine performances in it from Mulkey and Astin that you wish the filmmakers had trusted them more, letting them bring the film back to shore on their own.</Review>
            <Review>The film is a true two-hander-and Astin and Mulkey are mostly up for the task-but inept storytelling sinks the picture faster than anyone can bail it out.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>The film's palette is relentlessly beige, and Bosworth and Bentley echo that, speaking in elliptical hushes.</Review>
            <Review>"Amnesiac" feels like a director-for-hire gig for an artist too talented for the job.</Review>
            <Review>With no names given to the characters, you never have to remember them. But it's really best to forget about all of "Amnesiac."</Review>
            <Review>The film uses minimal locations, minimal cast, and minimal blood for a story that, in another director's hands, could play like Grand Guignol.</Review>
            <Review>This could have been something. Instead, what we have struggles to entice or encourage continued watching.</Review>
            <Review>The set-up is there - man wakes up to a life he knows nothing about and subsequently falls into a rabbit hole of lies and truths - but the execution and overall innovation just isn't there.</Review>
            <Review>The journey in Amnesic is still too pedestrian to be memorable.</Review>
            <Review>The sight of a fur-coat-wearing Bosworth wielding a blood stained power tool is a striking visual coup... Yet for the most part the story is too slackly stretched to sustain the tension the film needs to keep us gripped.</Review>
            <Review>Although it overplays its hand, Unconscious remains an interesting little film with a lot of promise.</Review>
            <Review>... feels too deliberate and calculated, as though it's a short-film concept stretched to feature length.</Review>
            <Review>You'll wish you were amnesiac yourself so you could forget this misbegotten mess.</Review>
            <Review>Retains a clear position for mystery and askew intimidation, boosted by competent lead performances from Bosworth (in a refreshing change of pace) and Bentley.</Review>

            <Review>Farhadi has written a first-rate script, enabling intricate plotting to intertwine with well-defined characters, and "About Elly" shows him at ease with the wide variety of situations his writing explores.</Review>
            <Review>"About Elly" is a stunning surprise package, profound in utterly unexpected ways.</Review>
            <Review>By the time the mystery is solved, it hardly seems to matter. What matters is the casual lack of honesty that almost everyone seems to depend on.</Review>
            <Review>It's an incisive portrait of a particular society, but it should resonate everywhere.</Review>
            <Review>There are no false notes anywhere in this cast of performers.</Review>
            <Review>Always, murmuring just beneath the surface, there's a political undercurrent to Farhadi's films, a gentle whisper of a critique aimed at the weight of Iran's combined cultural and political intransigence.</Review>
            <Review>The set-up recalls Michelangelo Antonioni's L'avventura but this mystery becomes a vehicle for social drama and sharp observations of friendships and marriages under pressure.</Review>
            <Review>Clever, compassionate, and completely riveting.</Review>
            <Review>The film is both riveting and resonant in overwhelming measures, and will remain one of the best released this year.</Review>
            <Review>This is a well-written, directed and acted film. The camera work by Hossein Jafarian is excellent. The story has a lot of sustained drama and mystery. Many women will view this very differently than most men in the audience.</Review>
            <Review>[The film has] a flair for the quietly theatrical and the conviction that various codes of gender and honour (religious, tribal, legal, or whatever) outweigh human connections in moments of extreme stress.</Review>
            <Review>About Elly stands as another strong example of one of the world's true emerging talents.</Review>

            <Review>A well-crafted horror pic that compensates (at least to a point) for its lack of original ideas with nice atmospherics and judicious restraint.</Review>
            <Review>"Dark Was The Night" is a horror movie, a creepy and atmospheric and sometimes blood-soaked horror movie, and it's got a good amount going for it.</Review>
            <Review>It's quite obvious the filmmakers didn't put a lot of thought into it and went straight for the cheapest thrills.</Review>
            <Review>The trouble lies in Tyler Hisel's script, which teems with wheezy conventions (as its title suggests) ...</Review>
            <Review>As generic as its title, Jack Heller's monster-in-the-woods horror film aspires to be the stuff of nightmares but instead merely lulls the viewer into an untroubled sleep.</Review>
            <Review>I mean, what else is the night supposed to be?</Review>
            <Review>An atmospheric creature fright film competently directed by Jack Heller.</Review>
            <Review>Not enough innovation to break free from its budgetary and generic constraints. The whole plot is pretty tight though, and it may just warrant a watch for the slightly unconventional finale.</Review>
            <Review>"Dark Was the Night" is not without a handful of sly, moody touches, but when it ends just as it should start ramping up, it is impossible not to walk away less than satisfied.</Review>
            <Review>"Dark was the Night" had the potential to engender scares, but the movie suffers from trying too hard.</Review>
            <Review>Yes, this is a horror movie - and a good one - but its tension does not derive primarily from the mechanics of suspense... Dark Was The Night wants to make you feel its character's pain.</Review>
            <Review>The narrative momentum stalls and formulaic cheap thrills take over in the final act.</Review>

            <Review>Occasionally Winterbottom delivers a haunting, effective moment, giving a hint of a different, more compelling film. But then it's back to the self-righteous, self-indulgent, muddled metaphors.</Review>
            <Review>The film does occasionally show a pulse when it tries to re-imagine the life of the victim - when it turns the tables on the mystery and tries to become a film about love and life, instead of doom and death. But it's too little, too late, and too lame.</Review>
            <Review>To get at the heart of what's wrong with "The Face of an Angel" all you need to do is consider the professional stones it takes to adapt the Amanda Knox case into yet another movie about the existential/amorous crises of a white male filmmaker.</Review>
            <Review>There's a great deal of intelligent material here. Winterbottom mounts a harsh attack on our fascination with killers and our tendency to forget the victim. Yet it's overlaid with so much navel-gazing, it's hard to take.</Review>
            <Review>Rambling, frustrating and wholly uninvolving, "The Face of an Angel" swarms with ideas that have no place to land.</Review>
            <Review>Like the floundering filmmaker at its center, "The Face of an Angel" never seems sure of what story it wants to tell.</Review>
            <Review>A sprawling, often provocative exploration of the ethics and competing interests involved in the coverage of a case like Elizabeth's murder.</Review>
            <Review>... drains most of the suspense by downplaying the whodunit aspect of the case in favor of a heavy-handed procedural about media ethics.</Review>
            <Review>The Face of an Angel takes too many detours and breaches its viewers' trust too many times to be taken seriously.</Review>
            <Review>built on the intriguing idea of using a thinly fictionalized version of the notorious Amanda Knox trial to explore how real-life events are transformed into art, but the resulting film gets muddy and misguided very quickly</Review>
            <Review>...the film is contrived, confusing, and, despite dense plotting, severely lacking in emotional or thematic depth.</Review>
            <Review>this one -- inspired by the real-life 2007 Amanda Knox/Meredith Kercher case -- seems content to wander off into meta-ness, even if it never arrives anywhere.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2015</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>79</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Amy is hanging on by a thread. Struggling to cope with past sexual trauma and the daily aggressions of a male-dominated society, she creates grotesquely costumed alter egos that re-appropriate the male form. While giving her the sense of power she craves, acting as these characters pushes her further into a world of her own making. When she begins a new relationship with a seemingly good guy, she opens herself up to him - but that vulnerability comes at a dangerous cost, and her alter egos threaten to lash out in explosive violence. Based on the real experiences and art of co-writer/star Amy Everson, Felt doesn't just point a finger at rape culture; it takes a full on swing at it, creating a feminist psychological thriller that audiences will be hard-pressed to shake off.

            <Review>It's a reminder that while genre movies usually look toward violence, there's just as rich territory to be explored in what happens after it, in the marks it leaves that go beyond the physical.</Review>
            <Review>"Felt" is a moodily disturbing character study of a besieged woman for whom art is engagement and coping mechanism, but also conversely a source of alienation and even a weapon.</Review>
            <Review>Director and co-writer Jason Banker's story of post-rape trauma is deeply unpleasant (you were expecting maybe a cheerful story, one in which Chekhov's gun somehow doesn't go off?), but thoughtfully, creatively so.</Review>
            <Review>Some viewers will no doubt find "Felt" maddening because it never answers seemingly crucial plot questions that a normal movie or TV show would feel compelled to clear up. That ambiguity is precisely the source of its power, and its cinematic quality.</Review>
            <Review>At once underwritten and overconceptualized. Reading about the filmmakers' intentions is more rewarding than watching the results.</Review>
            <Review>Although there are a few moments that feel a little too on the nose, Felt sneaks up on you and lingers for hours afterward.</Review>
            <Review>In its own fascinating and sideways manner, 'Felt' acknowledges and addresses the oft-ignored darkness at the center of these mass entertainments, and reframes their emotional and political implications.</Review>
            <Review>Mixing slow-building dread and mental health issues, Felt arrives as a needle prick of chaos.</Review>
            <Review>This is a revenge picture unlike any other, less a straightforward narrative than a meditation on retaining agency in a world determined to take it away. The feelings in Felt run deep.</Review>
            <Review>[It's] occasionally visually engaging, unique, and insightful, but also equal parts dull and overwrought.</Review>
            <Review>Different and daring but not quite satisfying.</Review>
            <Review>Whether we like or dislike movies like it is ultimately irrelevant compared to the responses they induce in their audiences. So consider this a guarantee: You won't walk away from Felt unmoved.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>Everyone loves Nicolas Cage the bug-eyed lunatic. Nicolas Cage the serious actor, that's a tougher sell.</Review>
            <Review>The Runner never approaches the keen insight and social satire of political films such as The Candidate, Primary Colors or Bulworth.</Review>
            <Review>Stark repeatedly squanders the decent supporting cast, revealing scant backstory that would enhance the often vague character motivation on display.</Review>
            <Review>These plot elements, and the actors, have all the makings of a truly juicy and thought-provoking political melodrama. So it's dispiriting to see filmmaker Stark create such a weird, jagged hash out of them.</Review>
            <Review>Cage's performance is as fuzzy as his character's sense of bearings.</Review>
            <Review>A hollow, listless political drama that could have been a contender.</Review>
            <Review>Despite its potentially juicy political premise and Nic Cage's relatively solid performance - more on that later - Austin Stark's The Runner ends up being a poor-man's version of politically-charged TV shows such as House of Cards and Scandal.</Review>
            <Review>Although first-time writer/director Austin Stark has his heart in the right place and Cage eschews his trademark zaniness, it's only watchable rather than gripping.</Review>
            <Review>Slow-moving political drama has strong language, some sex.</Review>
            <Review>Equal parts Big Oil message movie and melodramatic character study, The Runner gets so close to depth that it's weirdly frustrating to see it fail.</Review>
            <Review>... contains a fair amount of cynicism toward media sensationalism and the political system, yet by always focusing on the politicians instead of the working-class Gulf Coast residents ... the film indulges in that which it condemns.</Review>
            <Review>Cage makes us believe the good and the bad in this man.</Review>

            <Review>Consider Marion Cotillard's Oscar-nominated performance in Two Days, One Night a tour de nuance.</Review>
            <Review>As with their previous films, the brothers cast a discerning gaze on working-class lives, without preachiness or sentimentality.</Review>
            <Review>A dilemma so simple and so timely, it barely feels like fiction.</Review>
            <Review>There is strength in simplicity, something the Dardenne brothers' "Two Days, One Night" and its brilliant star, Marion Cotillard, prove emphatically.</Review>
            <Review>Wonderbrothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne return with a tale of heroic struggle against an ordinary disaster.</Review>
            <Review>In film after film the Dardennes have proven themselves the cinema's most acute humanist critics of predatory capitalism; this masterful drama finds them at the top of their game.</Review>
            <Review>Although it is a bit repetitive as a whole, the individual performances and in-the-moment flashes of truth more than carry the film.</Review>
            <Review>What separates Two Days, One Night from just another tale of a poor woman in desperate need is that the Dardennes have also, rather subtly, rendered a stunning portrait of marriage on the brink.</Review>
            <Review>[Cotillard is] the beating heart of a film that manages to whisper and scream at the same time.</Review>
            <Review>That's what is so devastating about this superb film: We might have Sandra's dilemma as the focus of our attention, but every one of these people has a comparable story. In these circumstances, that realization is heartbreaking.</Review>
            <Review>This is a defiantly political film about solidarity, loyalty to workmates and presenting a common front when jobs are threatened.</Review>
            <Review>Sandra spends the titular amount of time going all over the city, approaching her coworkers and trying to get them on her side. If that doesn't sound very interesting, then you don't know about the Dardennes' knack for keeping it fascinatingly real.</Review>

            <Review>Few actors in the world are better suited to play a gluttonous pig than Gerard Depardieu, and I mean that in the best possible way one can make such an assertion.</Review>
            <Review>[The] deliberate structure demonstrates Ferrara's artfulness, as does the lush imagery.</Review>
            <Review>The film, a sleek and oddly moving study in the cost of debauchery, has its gleeful excesses.</Review>
            <Review>This frank, unruly look at sex, privilege and power unfolds so much like real life that it proves an intriguing and strangely immersive experience.</Review>
            <Review>In an Abel Ferrara movie, this sort of damaged, raging, unrepentant bull passes for an antihero.</Review>
            <Review>The movie packs a singular, agonized vision that seems entirely the director's own.</Review>
            <Review>Queasily compelling.</Review>
            <Review>Welcome to New York is a bold, sometimes absurdly funny, and often-horrifying look into the Dominique Strauss-Kahn affair.</Review>
            <Review>Thankfully, the more interesting drama of the aftermath is intact, including Jacqueline Bisset's performance as Devereaux's wife, Simone, channeling a righteous anger not seen since Beatrice Straight in Network.</Review>
            <Review>Sordid melodrama, recreating a notorious scandal...</Review>
            <Review>Neither shocking nor illuminating, Welcome to New York comes off merely as hero worship of a terrible man who revels in his abuses of power.</Review>
            <Review>... a powerful and unflinching teardown of the criminal justice system amid the influence of wealth and political power.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>The story penned by Helander with Petri Jokiranta goes heavy on the hokum, not to mention the CGI fireworks, but a dialled-down Jackson and a fired-up Tommila make for an entertaining pair.</Review>
            <Review>There are times when it seems impossible that it could possibly exist as a real thing and not just as a parody trailer that accidentally got inflated to feature length.</Review>
            <Review>Gleefully dumb but eager to entertain, this is cheeseball stuff baked with deliciously outsized performances and low comedy and photographed across mighty beautiful landscapes.</Review>
            <Review>Mr. Jackson has never seemed so unblustery; his scenes with the younger actor have ease and humor. The authority is there but also the soul you'd want from the leader of the free world.</Review>
            <Review>"Big Game" never once feels credible, and that's why it's so entertaining. Almost nothing that takes place in this movie could occur in the real world, and there's something comforting about that.</Review>
            <Review>As a throwback, Big Game understands the thrills of retro action but never earns its big moments.</Review>
            <Review>Without the unusual Finnish elements, this would have been a far more mundane Game.</Review>
            <Review>Sometimes, one needs well-made, mindless entertainment in the middle of the summer, and Big Game delivers just that -- joyous, senseless entertainment without making you feel like you've just had a lobotomy.</Review>
            <Review>The black humor of Big Game's implausibility wonderfully complements the usually over-wrought notion of a terrorist attack.</Review>
            <Review>Everything that is good about Big Game can be summed up in two words and one letter -- Samuel L Jackson.</Review>
            <Review>The ensuing action is reliably ridiculous, but Tommila's plucky boy and Jackson's hapless president make an amusing double act.</Review>
            <Review>The ensuing action-adventure may promise more than it ultimately delivers but remains fun for long periods.</Review>

        <StoryLine>The Color Wheel is the story of JR, an increasingly transient aspiring news-anchor, as she forces her disappointing younger brother Colin to embark on a road trip to move her belongings out of her professor-turned-lover's apartment. Problem is, these grown up kids do not get along, and are both too obnoxious to know better. Chaos and calamity are not far behind her beat up Honda Accord. Too bad that nobody else in the world can stand either of them. Not Colin's neglectful girlfriend, nor JR's former high school friends, nor strangers they clash with at pretty much every step of their hopeless and increasingly infuriating voyage of frustration, failure and jerks. It can only be a matter of time before JR and Colin arrive at the strangest and most unsettling of resolutions and put to rest their decades of animosity, half-baked sibling rivalry and endless bickering. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>"The Color Wheel" turns up more annoyance than laughter.</Review>
            <Review>Alex Ross Perry's The Color Wheel begins as a scrappy, antagonistically funny road comedy and ends as something altogether stranger.</Review>
            <Review>The Color Wheel requires a brand of empathy mainstream audiences are unaccustomed to, but rewards it with nearly revolutionary insight.</Review>
            <Review>It's so rare to see something this scathing and sweet and strange that I have to recommend it enthusiastically.</Review>

            <Review>Davis (who was an executive producer on the film) gives a strong performance, as if she were acting in one of those many prestige projects lighting up her resume. It's a noble try, but this dreck is beyond saving.</Review>
            <Review>Alas, even a promising premise and a fine actress like Davis can't save an increasingly ludicrous plot. Justice may be served, but screenwriting logic? Not so much.</Review>
            <Review>Davis (who also served as a co-producer) does her damnedest to make something of her character and while not even her undeniable gifts make anything of it, it is oddly inspiring to see her at least making the effort.</Review>
            <Review>"Lila and Eve" deteriorates into a tawdry shoot-'em-up whose screenplay takes an ill-advised surreal twist that propels the movie deep into the ozone.</Review>
            <Review>A mid-point twist is particularly ridiculous, and in an attempt to reconcile this turning point, the final act of the movie becomes a mess.</Review>
            <Review>A standard-issue female vigilante thriller that's skillfully elevated by the performances of leads Viola Davis and Jennifer Lopez.</Review>
            <Review>Lila &amp; Eve embraces its psychological thrills rather than action, but it never fully commits to what that decision entails.</Review>
            <Review>There's no saving a high-voltage revenge drama that relies on selfies for its big reveal.</Review>
            <Review>Learning by doing, the avenging angels roll up on some thugs in a convenience store parking lot, infiltrate a hot dance club and home-invade a high-rise apartment; they also find time to wallpaper Lila's living room (Eve is an interior decorator, see).</Review>
            <Review>The script could have dealt seriously with issues of urban violence and struggling mothers, but instead it's a trivial tale of female empowerment.</Review>
            <Review>Revenge thriller packs violent punch but lacks excitement.</Review>
            <Review>So far, this is the worst film of 2015.</Review>

            <Review>Director Chris Dowling should have taken another swing at his script for the sake of clarity and dimension before cameras rolled.</Review>
            <Review>Not to be flip, but "Where Hope Grows" has the potential to be a decent inspirational film until God shows up.</Review>
            <Review>Like most if not all faith-based entertainments, "Where Hope Grows" embraces the idea that God works in mysterious ways. But it also insists that God helps only those who help themselves.</Review>
            <Review>"Where Hope Grows" wears its heart on its sleeve, hawking its message of salvation through faith to anyone who's in the market for cheesy uplift and saccharine sentiment.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director Chris Dowling handles [the] worrisome premise with a more even hand than this genre's ill-advised predecessors ...</Review>
            <Review>DeSanctis is a force of nature, and for the most part this is less of a Bible thumper than a Bible tapper, but it gets downright shameless in the third act.</Review>
            <Review>More admirable for its effort than its execution.</Review>
            <Review>Moving faith-based friendship drama not just for believers.</Review>
            <Review>A genuinely heartwarming movie that also has a strong message and solid acting.</Review>
            <Review>A Christian drama about a boy with Down Syndrome who works wonders in the life of a depressed alcoholic.</Review>
            <Review>Chris Dowling's second feature at first seems anodyne enough, but once the plot mechanics kick into high gear, the film becomes as unsurprising as a prix fixe menu.</Review>
            <Review>What elevates the movie is the solid performances by Kristoffer Polaha and David DeSanctis.</Review>

            <Review>It's downright playful, in fact, funky chic and cheeky. Somewhere, Banksy is smiling.</Review>
            <Review>Reveals a provocative social experiment and raises questions about ownership of public art.</Review>
            <Review>Banksy -- like most ruffians who took to scrawling on public property and fleeing the police -- has a strong anti-establishment tone running through his work, and his best NYC work is reliably cheeky.</Review>
            <Review>Made for the smallscreen (but don't hold that against it), this is an enjoyable romp through Staten Island, the Lower East Side, inner Manhattan and beyond, and is essential for any Banksy devotee.</Review>
            <Review>Moukarbel's straightforward film is more domesticated than the work it profiles, but it's a dutiful document of an event that, despite Banksy's fame, remained on the periphery of the art world establishment.</Review>
            <Review>A documentary with all the noise, mayhem, pandemonium and ingenuity of both the artist and the city that never sleeps, although it still manages to dream.</Review>
            <Review>How much you like the movie will largely depend on how much you like the art. For the record, we like it quite a bit.</Review>
            <Review>Very enjoyable documentary following the fun-filled month the secretive street art collective known as Banksy spent spreading its works across New York city...a fun ride.</Review>
            <Review>The talking heads can't tell us much, but Moukarbel makes deft use of crowd-sourced footage to convey the wildly different ways New Yorkers engaged with the works.</Review>
            <Review>The film itself is playful and quite fun.</Review>
            <Review>This cinema release will be useful for people who don't have cable and are interested in questions about the ownership of contemporary street art.</Review>
            <Review>Wittily, cleverly and thoroughly covers that residency, thus providing those of us who weren't in that city at that time the chance to experience just what a major and wondrous artistic event it was.</Review>

            <Review>This woman has plenty of blunt wisdom to share.</Review>
            <Review>'Iris" is a joyful look at an aging eccentric and an examination of the playful nature of design and fashion; it likely won't change your life, but will bring a smile to your face.</Review>
            <Review>A flurry of excitement greets her wherever she goes; throughout the adulation, she is appreciative, patiently bemused, a little cranky and only occasionally tickled.</Review>
            <Review>Iris is an absolute kick, whether or not you care a whit about the world this character is moving through. And she is a character, with her big round glasses and her big opinions.</Review>
            <Review>Maysles simply presents lots of other designers telling Apfel how brilliant she is, their testimony interspersed with pithy accounts of her past achievements.</Review>
            <Review>The film plays like a refreshingly frank visit with a favorite relative.</Review>
            <Review>So much more than meets Iris's bespectacled eyes: looking at self-determination, relentless individuality, devil-may-care creativity, romance, fame and mortality...all peppered throughout with delicious humor.</Review>
            <Review>An especially realistic portrait of human life even by the standards of an inherently realistic genre.</Review>
            <Review>A charming if occasionally too-reverential portrait of New York identity and self-described "geriatric starlet" Iris Apfel.</Review>
            <Review>There is, for all the frivolity of her business, a gravitas and magnetism about Iris Apfel: she's smart and funny and sassy enough for the viewer to see past a life of privilege and walk-in wardrobes.</Review>
            <Review>Iris offers an entertaining view into the artistic process, encroaching mortality, and societal trends.</Review>
            <Review>Fashion is a combination of history, science, architecture, culture and politics, according to Iris. More than any other film, this film provides some answers to this question: Why is fashion important?</Review>

            <Review>Citizenfour argues that when we lose our personal privacy, we also lose our liberty, because fear overcomes our freedom of speech.</Review>
            <Review>Citizenfour plays like a thriller as it chronicles a complex and vitally important chapter in our history.</Review>
            <Review>[1984] is looking less like fiction with each passing day.</Review>
            <Review>Yes, we should be concerned about what our government is up to, but we should also be skeptical of Citizenfour.</Review>

            <Review>A fans- and detractors-only affair. At its worst, it feels like a highbrow transgressive-celebrity-cameo skit.</Review>
            <Review>Hilarious, full of humor that is understated, wry and dependent on familiarity with interests as wide as Houellebecq's own.</Review>
            <Review>This is pretty much the opposite of a contemporary American comedy: rather than broad, "The Kidnapping of Michel Houllebecq" is an exemplary example of narrow.</Review>
            <Review>The Houellebecq we see on screen is obviously rooted as much in fiction as in fact, yet what makes his performance so fascinating is the mischievous glee he takes in sending up his own persona.</Review>
            <Review>A divertingly eccentric, often comically absurd movie about a novelist ... who finds something like happiness after being abducted.</Review>
            <Review>A playful blurring of fact and fiction.</Review>
            <Review>The Kidnapping of Michel Houellebecq is on one hand a rather ingenious take on the artist documentary, on the other, a tabletop comedy of manners, closer to something by Gianni Di Gregorio or Hong Sang-soo than to Houellebecq's own work.</Review>
            <Review>There's something undeniably comic about this combination of the cultivated and the infantile.</Review>
            <Review>A most curious film. What follows is something like an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm with the volume turned down.</Review>
            <Review>Extremely droll comedy about France's (if not the world's) most controversial novelist, who turns in a great job playing himself.</Review>
            <Review>At first, the movie is offbeat enough to be entertaining anyway; but like the title character, it quickly outstays its welcome.</Review>
            <Review>Even though the film takes on a more overtly fictive aesthetic after he's kidnapped, Michel Houellebecq's understated presence lends the proceedings a factual quality throughout.</Review>

Intrigued and excited by Madeleine's wild ideas, Arnaud signs up for the boot camp himself. They soon realize that the boot camp is harder than they'd imagined, but the experience nonetheless cements them together as the couple continues to explore their young love. (C) Strand</StoryLine>

            <Review>Love at First Fight is overflowing with relentlessly acerbic humor that shapes the way the film's two young protagonists contend with not just each other, but also with the uncertainties of the world they're emerging into as adults.</Review>
            <Review>Aggression, not affection, sparks romance in Les Combattants, a promising feature debut that already had members of the French film establishment touting newcomer Thomas Cailley as the next big thing.</Review>
            <Review>Director Thomas Cailley conjures up a vivid, unusual world, offering a playful reversal of usual gender roles.</Review>
            <Review>There's a better movie floating around the edges of the French import "Love at First Fight" than first-time feature director Thomas Cailley has allowed to surface.</Review>
            <Review>All in all, this film is refreshingly original, an existential, boy-meets-survivalist romantic comedy.</Review>
            <Review>What starts out as a promisingly unique tale of a macho woman and the meek guy who falls for her turns into something else once Madeleine leaves for training camp and Arnaud follows.</Review>
            <Review>The debut feature for its young writer-director, this unassuming but engaging French dramedy deserves the prizes it picked up at Cannes and at the country's Oscar-equivalent Cesars.</Review>
            <Review>Irritably charming, Love at First Fight is a warm summer romance destined to be remade by Hollywood.</Review>
            <Review>Les Combattants is diverting enough, but it is not exceptional.</Review>
            <Review>Crowd-pleasing without compromising on its uniqueness, the result has romcom structure but a beguiling adventure mood reminiscent of the best US indies.</Review>
            <Review>Thomas Cailley's Love at First Fight is a French romantic comedy that's a good thing for a change, instead feeling more like a charming YA novel.</Review>
            <Review>The dramatic final act is audacious, yet wholly in keeping with the film's bubbling themes of love and war.</Review>

            <Review>[A] movie that curiously attempts to humanize an aloof industry by associating it with a 17th-century fairy tale.</Review>
            <Review>Portia Doubleday stars in a frothy teen comedy as unobjectionable as it is unmemorable.</Review>
            <Review>If Shakespeare had a go at "Cinderella," and the result was later adapted for a 21st-century romantic comedy, it might look something like "After the Ball."</Review>
            <Review>Certainly, the production values echo those of high-end made-for-TV fare, but the cast and amusing script more than make up for what the movie lacks in gloss.</Review>
            <Review>It's pretty much a one-joke effort that wants to be The Devil Wears Prada but plays more like a middling episode of a TV sitcom.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately, if you want to choke on a narrative that is rife with clichés and devoid of any real moral message then stick After The Ball on, if not, there are surely more productive things you can do... Such as watching paint dry.</Review>
            <Review>Cinderella offshoot has dull characters, predictable plot.</Review>
            <Review>Retaining a handful of laughs and guiding a winning lead performance from Portia Doubleday, director Sean Garrity keeps "After the Ball" on target, preserving mischief and romance, providing a charming viewing experience.</Review>
            <Review>After the Ball is one-third Cinderella, one-third The Devil Wears Prada, and one third Twelfth Night. If you're going to attempt to duplicate the success of such works, you've got to be a little sharper than it ends up being.</Review>
            <Review>Cinderella adrift in the fashion world is the premise for this harmless piece of fluff.</Review>
            <Review>For a film ostensibly attuned to the world of fashion, the film's portrayal of queer men is decidedly retro.</Review>

            <Review>A rather silly, unbelievable thriller.</Review>
            <Review>Filmmaker Nadda's stock-in-trade is restraint, but October Gale builds up to nothing much.</Review>
            <Review>October Gale is a quiet thriller set in the wilds of Georgian Bay. It's an uneven movie with some odd jolts in the story, but the performances -- especially from Patricia Clarkson -- are noteworthy.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director Ruba Nadda is wonderful at building up suspense for the first half of her latest film. But once she's got our attention, she has nowhere to go with it.</Review>
            <Review>A film that begins as a languorous study in grieving and shifts with screeching abruptness into a crime thriller.</Review>
            <Review>The best parts of this tepid thriller, which seems designed to actually lower audience's heart rates, arrive before the plot kicks in.</Review>
            <Review>When I wasn't laughing at the absurdity of where things go I was bored out of my mind waiting for long silent stares hiding nothing to finally turn into action.</Review>
            <Review>A great performance by Patricia Clarkson - so what else is new? - can't save this strange thriller.</Review>
            <Review>October Gale is a pleasant place to visit, though a dull, predictable movie to watch.</Review>
            <Review>... eventually ditches its character-driven approach in favor of far-fetched plot twists and melodramatic contrivances.</Review>
            <Review>[Clarkson and Speedman's] strong performances carry the viewer over any narrative bald patches to a sudden and yet satisfying conclusion.</Review>

            <Review>The faux press conferences and perverse inventions (SurvivaBall, anyone?) that are included here highlight corporate greed and governmental shortsightedness as shrewdly as ever.</Review>
            <Review>As usual, the mood is genial and the anticorporate politics refreshingly blunt.</Review>
            <Review>Although this latest documentary is, in large part, simply more of the same stuff we saw in the earlier films, there's also a lot of background material here about Servin and Vamos that makes this outing a bit more interesting.</Review>
            <Review>Who said that a political film can't be sweet, too? In its grandest triumph, "The Yes Men Are Revolting" is an activist doc inspired by more than just its topical issues.</Review>
            <Review>"The Yes Men Are Revolting," their third film, has a personal poignancy that is missing in the forerunners, "The Yes Men" (2003) and "The Yes Men Fix the World" (2009).</Review>
            <Review>Laughing at the apocalypse is hard work.</Review>
            <Review>While the subject matter remains intriguing, The Yes Men deserve a better and more intimate documentary than they have made about themselves.</Review>
            <Review>For the most part it revels in the Yes Men's chutzpah. You will, too.</Review>
            <Review>Are they burned out or will they manage to capitalize on a new generation of activists to train?. . . This informative and entertaining joint portrait is encouraging start.</Review>
            <Review>Nix and the Yes Men have mostly brought a wry joy to the doom-filled genre of climate change nonfiction, and for that they should be commended.</Review>
            <Review>As directed by the Yes Men and Laura Nix, Revolting is often as melancholy as its largely inspired agitprop is comical.</Review>
            <Review>The third big-screen go-around for the duo of activist pranksters has some moments of inspired rabble-rousing, but overall feels sort of tame and repetitive compared to its predecessors.</Review>

            <Review>Despite boasting several important moral lessons, the period piece is more artificial than a polyester teddy bear stuffed with Splenda and Cheez Whiz - and about as appealing</Review>
            <Review>It's meant to be a tale of uplift for faith-based audiences, but instead wears viewers down with a heavy-handed narrative, an overbearing score and voiceover that spells out everything in cringe-inducing, folksy tones.</Review>
            <Review>Tolerance, World War II history and faith are served up with a sticky sentimental gloss in the family film "Little Boy."</Review>
            <Review>A movie that has the haranguing inspirational tone of a marathon Sunday-school lesson.</Review>
            <Review>I just wish the filmmakers didn't feel like they had to hit us over the head with all the moral pontificating to get their point across.</Review>
            <Review>The audience at which Little Boy is aimed will have no problem assimilating the film's themes of faith and miracles. But there's also plenty to admire here for those less inclined to buy into the filmmakers' worldview.</Review>
            <Review>A shamefully miscalculated tale of whimsy and come-to-Jesus inspiration with a bizarrely inappropriate haze of Norman Rockwell-esque nostalgia.</Review>
            <Review>The twists and turns may feel a little forced, and a few moments might even be shocking. But Little Boy squeezes the most it can from a quality cast and the best of intentions.</Review>
            <Review>While its religious context may prove off putting for some viewers, it's a heart-warming tear jerker for the family, or those who just want to see a boy fight for his dad to come home.</Review>
            <Review>The movie lumbers on for 100 minutes with hardly a believable frame to show for it.</Review>

            <Review>Opens the window on a pivotal time in 1960s (and early 1970s) pop culture.</Review>
            <Review>Lambert and Stamp are at least a bit fascinating, or at least somewhat interesting. But this film runs nearly two hours. They are at best an hour-and-a-half's worth of interesting.</Review>
            <Review>Lambert &amp; Stamp is at its best when it chronicles the high-wire act of the band's early years, as the pair guided the band through ever-greater levels of success.</Review>
            <Review>An engrossing business story that approaches the band as a showbiz concern, recognizing the two managers as full creative partners and probing their relationships with the fractious musicians.</Review>
            <Review>You might call this a business story. But I call it a love story, and I think director Cooper might, too.</Review>
            <Review>Who fans will be this film's biggest audience, but the storytelling is limited by the fact that Lambert died in 1981 (of alcohol and drug abuse).</Review>
            <Review>Cooper's cinematic scrapbook captures a relentless whirlwind of explosive rock history, in which a non-linear narrative and slick cinematography rollicks furiously through the decades, rooting the audience directly in the band's volcanic timeline.</Review>
            <Review>Though it's not just for Who fans, those well-versed in the band will enjoy picking out some of the more obscure, copyright-friendly songs used in the appropriately loud soundtrack.</Review>
            <Review>Lambert played an essential role in encouraging Pete Townshend's songwriting, which is an important tidbit, but most of the info here won't be new to Who fans. That early footage, on the other hand, is documentary gold.</Review>
            <Review>"A fresh and invigorating film that avoids many of the clichés of the 'rockumentary.'"</Review>
            <Review>Cinematographer James D. Cooper makes his directorial debut with this entertaining, if incomplete, account of how the six men made it together as far as the creation of the rock opera Tommy before self- destructing.</Review>

            <Review>The problem with 5 to 7 is that the most important romance, between Brian and Arielle, never feels real.</Review>
            <Review>One of the best date-night movies of the season without a doubt.</Review>
            <Review>There aren't many surprises in "5 to 7," unless you count such startlingly cliched bits of dialogue as "Life is a collection of moments" and "There's no free lunch."</Review>
            <Review>The Brian-and-Arielle story never quite feels believable; it plays more like a novel than a genuine love story, like a work in progress, rather than a beginning and, inevitably, an end.</Review>
            <Review>Saccharine, overwhelmingly melodramatic and filmed with a glossy sheen, one is either quickly won over by the charms of the romantic drama 5 to 7 or simply turned off from the start.</Review>
            <Review>5 To 7 is a pretty standard rom-com, but sets the bar higher than most with it's French New Wave references.</Review>
            <Review>While it doesn't exactly take your breath away, this small coming-of-age story will make you smile about how film can romanticise even the slightest of ideas.</Review>
            <Review>Go along with the dopey premise of 5 To 7 for as long as you can, and its guilty-pleasure charms will kind of grow on you.</Review>
            <Review>The fairytale aura is nourished by outdated yet timeless notions of Frenchness and Americanness, grand romantic fantasies in themselves.</Review>
            <Review>This is an above average romantic weeper despite its classist flaws and its liberal scrounging from The French New Wave.</Review>

            <Review>The whole never makes much sense, and there's entirely too much screaming, but the directors stage the shocks with wicked aplomb.</Review>
            <Review>Richings is fantastic as Cassidy, possessed by vulnerability yet never presented as weak.</Review>
            <Review>Over the course of Ejecta's 83-minute runtime, it felt like I was watching three very different movies at once, but they never quite all come together cohesively. The film also squanders a strong performance from Julian Richings.</Review>
            <Review>Burgess' script has an ingenious structure that leaves the middle of the story blank, but Ejecta doesn't improve by sketching in that central mystery.</Review>
            <Review>Ejecta is just another sci-fi flick without a true identity, playing off extraterrestrial stereotypes that have been used time and time again.</Review>
            <Review>On narrative alone, it's hard to recommend EJECTA, but on style and flourish, it's hard not to.</Review>
            <Review>Quite possibly an alien torture device designed to turn our brains to mush. *sob*</Review>
            <Review>A few crisp encounters retain pleasing intimidation, but directors Chad Archibald and Matt Wiele are too busy making a visual effects demo reel to care much about the dramatic value of their feature.</Review>
            <Review>A wearisome, empty-headed mess, barely feeling as if it is a completed film at all. When it is over, its memoryjust like an otherworldly probeall but entirely vanishes in an instant.</Review>
            <Review>The cogent character study nestled inside all the bombast remains crafty for its rare commingling of artful storytelling and genre nonsensicality.</Review>

            <Review>It's never explained what Allan's mental state is, other than lovable geriatric rascal-itis, an irritating trope that hardly constitutes a certifiable condition.</Review>
            <Review>"The 100-Year-Old-Man" is wonderfully inventive, silly fun.</Review>
            <Review>This peripatetic farce practically propels itself.</Review>
            <Review>It seems destined for a Hollywood remake, which is likely to be more polished but not nearly as weirdly charming.</Review>

            <Review>Eccentric, wry and highly entertaining.</Review>
            <Review>Surreal and very silly.</Review>
            <Review>The 100 Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared is gleefully amoral, never more so than when ruminating on how families are formed.</Review>

            <Review>There's a strange, almost perverse lesson here about a well-lived life, how Allan manages to move through life without regret or fear. He's crossed every item off his bucket list - and then blown up the bucket.</Review>

            <Review>There's precious little charm or magic in this English-dubbed, German-produced fairy-tale mash-up.</Review>
            <Review>Elements from "Snow White," "Sleeping Beauty," "Tangled," "Frozen," "Happy Feet" and "Shrek" have been ineptly stitched together into a leaden film that children will enjoy about as much as lumps in their oatmeal.</Review>
            <Review>The Seventh Dwarf's female characters are deplorably retrograde on both the script and design levels; they have little to do except be rescued, and Snow White is a vain, buxom sexpot whom the dwarfs leer at.</Review>
            <Review>This mashup of references is unoriginal. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Musical fairy tale has familiar story but is fine for kids.</Review>
            <Review>The animation quality equals that of the 1990s CGI TV series "ReBoot," which was great...for the 1990s.</Review>
            <Review>A mediocre animated riff on the Sleeping Beauty, not Snow White, tale. A time-killer for bored 5-year olds, nothing more.</Review>
            <Review>There are innumerable preferable ways to kill some time without having to endure some of the most determinedly ugly computer animation I have seen in years.</Review>
            <Review>The script balances kiddie-friendly winsomeness and knowing winks for grownups, and is more tightly constructed than you'd expect, with even fleeting throwaway gags delivering plot payoffs later on.</Review>

            <Review>Strangerland runs out of gas, leaving us with a couple of final "Forget You" (shall we say) moments. Thanks. Thanks for nothing.</Review>
            <Review>Director Kim Farrant goes for a feeling that's as harsh, unforgiving, and wild as the land she lets the camera linger on, and it's the right idea when handling the potential melodrama of the material.</Review>
            <Review>erie and unpredictable, Strangerland holds attention, even if traditional suspense tricks are avoided like they were dingos at the daycare.</Review>
            <Review>Kidman's best performances have often been as grieving moms (Dead Calm, The Others, Rabbit Hole) and here she provides the flaccid movie's sole flash of daring and unpredictability.</Review>
            <Review>Director Kim Farrant's debut feature is beautifully shot and offers some powerful, well-acted moments from a strong cast, but it's just relentlessly dreary.</Review>
            <Review>It certainly provides Kidman with some meaty, twisted material. But the film abandons the viewer in the end, leaving the audience as lost as those kids.</Review>
            <Review>Secrets and lies is the name of the game, in other words, as this taut but sinister ensemble piece turns the screws in what is an intelligent, all-engrossing - and indeed Irish-produced - film.</Review>
            <Review>A shift in focus from a potentially jittery thriller to a humdrum, psychological analysis of a dislocated family becomes the narrative driving force and given the rich backdrop, it appears a great opportunity has been severely missed.</Review>
            <Review>She is as invigorated by her missing daughter's sexuality as her husband is terrified. It's an interesting enough subtext, but foregrounded, it's not enough to carry the muddled movie that ensues.</Review>
            <Review>All the guilt, shame and anguish create a heady brew in an atmospheric but sometimes overwrought tale of a family in crisis.</Review>
            <Review>While director Kim Farrant superbly captures the haunting, parched beauty of the Aussie interior in her debut feature, she stumbles when it comes to the emotional landscape, with the movie flickering uncertainly in tone.</Review>
            <Review>The result won't astound but it will intrigue - at least for a time.</Review>

            <Review>While there is a well-maintained sense of lurking discomfort, the gotcha scenes feel a little cheap.</Review>
            <Review>It just isn't as informative as it could be. It's plenty scary, and on that level satisfying. It would be great to see Ascher make a full-on horror feature.</Review>
            <Review>In the faces of these men and women, ranging in age from their 20s to their 40s and spread out everywhere from Los Angeles to Manchester, you can see the genuine terror they suffered - and, in some cases, continue to suffer.</Review>
            <Review>Ascher plunges us into the actual visions that sleep paralysis creates: the moving silhouette figures, the darkness, the static. The sense of terror is palpable.</Review>
            <Review>Ascher is too content to let repetition of experience take over his film. No sleep studiers or brain experts or anybody else, for that matter, are interviewed.</Review>
            <Review>While "Room 237" sought evidence for its most outlandish conceits, "The Nightmare" declines to delve. As the testimonies grow repetitive, the strategy suggests willful ignorance.</Review>
            <Review>Few non-fiction films pack the affective punch of The Nightmare, which seeks to turn viewers into mirror images of its terror-stricken subjects.</Review>
            <Review>An intriguing feature, but one that ends up dulling your senses with repetitive talking heads and recreated scenarios.</Review>
            <Review>The Nightmare is a completely singular work of documentary, unseen before to this degree of craftsmanship.</Review>
            <Review>Both the re-creations and the interviews themselves are filmed for maximum spookiness.</Review>
            <Review>It's compelling viewing, as well as disturbing as hell. Honestly, who needs the spectres of Insidious: Chapter 3 when our own brains are capable of scaring us half to death.</Review>
            <Review>Alongside the personal struggles recounted here is that wider shift of perspective that every documentary maker longs to achieve.</Review>

When darkness falls and bullied Sam catches a glimpse of Kai, his repeated attempts to warn his troupe fall on deaf ears. But it isn't long until the body count starts to rise, and no one can deny the truth - something deadly is lurking in the shadows, and it has come to prey on them. Surprisingly, Sam soon begins to develop a tenuous bond with the strange child. But Kai isn't the only threat out there, and it won't be long now before Sam discovers the true meaning of fear. Zombi's Steve Moore provides the synth-heavy score for this grim horror thriller. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>Referencing everything from 'Suspiria' to 'The Cabin in the Woods', this is a horror movie made by and for genre fans - but that's not necessarily a good thing.</Review>
            <Review>This backwoods camping adventure and folk-legend fusion flies off the rails, unleashing a grotesque and vile nature in every character. "Cub" will leave you wanting to pack up your things and head home early.</Review>
            <Review>Cub is characterised by terrific performances (especially from the pre-teen cast), playfully ghoulish bloodwork, and the most inventive instruments of death we've seen since the Saw franchise ran out of ideas.</Review>
            <Review>The film's producers should give audiences a sew-on badge for surviving this.</Review>
            <Review>Similar in tone to Let The Right One In, it starts slowly and builds into a fantastical and creepy look at childhood.</Review>
            <Review>At a time when horror movies seem to only want to make the audience jump, it's great to find one that bothers to build a sense of dread.</Review>
            <Review>Feels a bit like 15 slasher movies you've already seen, but also ends up being a rather novel, unpredictable, and insane little horror flick.</Review>
            <Review>The film creates a pleasing air of mystery that director Jonas Govaerts sadly loses all interest in sustaining.</Review>
            <Review>The build-up is entertainingly eccentric, and there's some ingenious booby-trappery at work among the pines, but Cub runs dry once it knuckles down to the routine bloodletting.</Review>
            <Review>Not much adventure. Not much horror.</Review>
            <Review>Cub will keep gorehounds happy, but its cruel dismissal of youth makes it disturbing in more ways than it should be.</Review>
            <Review>Impressively nightmarish.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2015</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>100</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Named for the famous seventeenth-century Roman church Sant'Ivo alla Sapienza, which was designed by the legendary architect (and Bernini rival) Francesco Borromini, LA SAPIENZA echoes Rossellini's Viaggio in Italia in its tale of Alexandre Schmid (Fabrizio Rongione), a brilliant architect who, plagued by doubts and loss of inspiration, embarks on a quest of artistic and spiritual renewal guided by his study of Borromini. His wife Ali�nor (Christelle Prot), similarly troubled by the crassness of contemporary society - as well as the couple's lack of communication and passion - decides to accompany him. In Stresa, a chance encounter with adolescent siblings Goffredo (who is about to commence his own architectural studies) and his fragile sister Lavinia upends the couple's plans. As Borromini's spirit and the vertiginous splendour of his structures spin a mysterious web among them, within the course of a few days the foursome experiences a series of life-altering revelations.

        <Reviews>
            <Review>On the surface, writer-director Eugène Green's film "La Sapienza" is slow, strange and awkward - but stick with it and it may win you over.</Review>
            <Review>The Sapience juxtaposes insights on how people are emotionally connected with ruminations on the buildings and spaces through which they move, in which they live and, in Alexandre's case, which they also create.</Review>
            <Review>A beautiful space for people and light.</Review>
            <Review>This kind of formalism needs to do more than walk through classical wonders. It should want to create cinema that can stand near or beside them. This movie defensively consecrates what's already there. You don't need a film to do that.</Review>
            <Review>An exquisite rumination on life, love and art that tickles the heart and mind in equal measure.</Review>
            <Review>Green's richly textured, painterly images fuse with the story to evoke the essence of humane urbanity and the relationships that it fosters, whether educational, familial, or erotic.</Review>
            <Review>This startling architectural juxtaposition feels like a wake-up call.</Review>
            <Review>While Green's film is dense with historical fact and theory, it's not averse to plumbing life's mysteries. Suffused with warmth, it expresses a potent admiration for human striving and accomplishment.</Review>
            <Review>The uncomplicated narrative resists stylization; Green's presentation turns everyone into mannequins, rendering their emotions theoretical. That may well be his point, but it didn't work for me.</Review>
            <Review>Layered with reels of swirling shots of Rome's most beautiful buildings -- all crucially shot from the ground upwards, staring at the heavens-- La Sapienza is visually stunning.</Review>
            <Review>If you can groove into this non-realistic mode, the film casts a spell.</Review>
            <Review>Pretentious, stuffy and slow. There's some beautiful scenery here but oh, what you must put up with to earn it!</Review>

        <StoryLine>Knifed Up: The Evolution of Plastic Surgery examines the idea of the idealized female form amongst African-Americans, and what black women will do to achieve that look. From the ample posterior work that popular public figures like Nikki Minaj boast, to breast enhancement and face lifts, the film analyzes the lengths that women go to possess the model image that they desire, including liposuction, facial work and more, as well as the health risks that these procedures bring about. As more female celebrities speak out proudly about the "work" they've had, and the various ways in which they've had their own bodies altered, this cultural documentary asks whether or not the desired effects outweigh the potentially damaging longterm consequences, and whether the model image these patients are searching for is even attainable.</StoryLine>

            <Review>If you like your martial arts films to be action-packed, but also unironically simplistic, and thoughtlessly violent, then you will really enjoy Skin Trade.</Review>
            <Review>Dolph Lundgren and Tony Jaa star in this tedious, formulaic actioner.</Review>
            <Review>If bare-knuckle fights are what you seek, director Ekachai Uekrongtham certainly delivers.</Review>
            <Review>A no-frills, no-winks throwback to the mid-1980s heyday of the American-style action movie, crossed with the one-on-one, mixed-martial-arts sensibilities of today's direct-to-video action flicks.</Review>
            <Review>It's nostalgic fun to watch genuine martial arts experts fighting each other on the screen.</Review>
            <Review>One area where the script unexpectedly shines is an ending which completes the story, respects the reality of loss and sets up a sequel I sincerely hope we get to see.</Review>
            <Review>It's an undeniable kick to watch Jaa, ever graceful and balletic, getting thrown around like a puny rag doll by his man-mountain co-star, even if Skin Trade is a little too ham-fisted to pack any serious punch.</Review>
            <Review>Director Ekachai Uekrongtham strands Lundgren and Jaa in a series of poorly edited, confusingly shot gunfights that make little use of either man's talents.</Review>
            <Review>Offering literally nothing original, Skin Trade is just a bargain bin action vehicle for an aging star. Still, if you're cool with that, Dolph will be more than happy to beat the crap out of some villains for your amusement.</Review>
            <Review>Skin Trade is a throwback to the one-man-army actioners of the '80s, sprinkled with updated stats on human trafficking.</Review>
            <Review>"Skin Trade" doesn't follow through on its potential for horror, quickly devolving into a roughhouse revenge picture that consumes cliché by the pound.</Review>
            <Review>Not a great showcase for Tony Jaa, but Dolph Lundgren makes Skin Trade worth watching for action fans.</Review>

        <Duration>89</Duration>
        <StoryLine>SOAKED IN BLEACH reveals the events behind Kurt Cobain's death as seen through the eyes of Tom Grant, the private investigator that was hired by Courtney Love in 1994 to track down her missing husband (Kurt Cobain) only days before his deceased body was found at their Seattle home. Cobain's death was ruled a suicide by the police (a reported self-inflicted gunshot wound), but doubts have circulated for twenty years as to the legitimacy of this ruling, especially due to the work of Mr. Grant, a former L.A. County Sheriff's detective, who did his own investigation and determined there was significant empirical and circumstantial evidence to conclude that foul play could very well have occurred. The film develops as a narrative mystery with cinematic re-creations, interviews with key experts and witnesses and the examination of official artifacts from the 1994 case.</StoryLine>

            <Review>By the time Wecht declares that this is a death that simply has to be reinvestigated, even a viewer with no special attachment to Cobain's legacy is likely to agree.</Review>
            <Review>This is a bad film, filled with awkward reenactments, poorly designed graphics, scripted interview segments, ominous music and enough jumping to conclusions that I'm surprised someone didn't throw out their back.</Review>
            <Review>Whether he's way off base or not, Tom Grant is clearly a believer, and the ideas he presents via Soaked In Bleach-as unabashedly one-sided as they are-aren't easily dismissed.</Review>
            <Review>The problem is, when facing down Love's and Cobain's outsize, junked-up personalities, Grant seems a total naïf.</Review>
            <Review>The story is still provocative, but the director has nothing new to add to it.</Review>
            <Review>If you're a rabid Cobain murder theorist, "Soaked in Bleach" will undoubtedly reconfirm all of your beliefs on the subject. If you're also certain that Cobain killed himself, I doubt that there's anything here to truly convince you otherwise.</Review>
            <Review>...even if Soaked in Bleach's message landed on sympathetic ears, the film makes curious decisions that distract from their central thesis.</Review>
            <Review>Soaked in Bleach is so heavily rooted in hearsay and circumstantial suggestions that the film-and its speakers-often seem to be grasping at straws.</Review>
            <Review>After a while, Statler's hodgepodge approach loses its novelty, and the documentary starts to seem like an overlong, overly strident segment of a true-crime cable TV infotainment series.</Review>

            <Review>This is a very poorly paced and structured movie, cutting between time periods to fill in the sort of convoluted backstory that a leaner, more propulsive piece of pulp probably wouldn't bother with in the first place.</Review>
            <Review>Jackie Chan makes a dull departure from his former kickass shenanigans in this rickety action-drama.</Review>
            <Review>This is predictable crime thriller fluff that you've come to expect from a deteriorating legend. Police Story: Lockdown isn't entirely awful, but it dilutes what was otherwise a nearly flawless and action packed franchise.</Review>

            <Review>It plays like an extended promo, washed with a score of elevator-music strings, and composed of so many talking-head snatches that it often feels like a trailer for itself.</Review>
            <Review>It's amazing that a documentary so clumsy has such incredible highs and lows, but that's the power of Big Bird for you.</Review>
            <Review>I Am Big Bird is not great filmmaking but it pays fitting tribute to Spinney and the character into which he invested so much of his own personality.</Review>
            <Review>The purity of intent and sophisticated craft [Spinney] has poured into their creation remains unacknowledged by the general public. The modestly appointed, crowd-funded documentary I Am Big Bird should clear up that oversight once and for all.</Review>
            <Review>Spinney is well-deserving of the attention, and from a standpoint of sheer curiosity and fascination, knowing more about this man who created a character that we loved as children and that our children now love, is a gently poignant experience.</Review>

            <Review>Hope endures, but not for this movie.</Review>
            <Review>It's curious that the only conflict mined from this bicultural relationship is strictly linguistic.</Review>
            <Review>Perhaps only an expat like American-born, Hong Kong-based director Stanley J. Orzel could create a tribute to his adopted city as loving as Lost for Words.</Review>
            <Review>[Faris'] relationship with co-star Huang, while cordial, hardly reflects an emotional connection strong enough for him to conquer his character's post-romantic breakup stress syndrome.</Review>
            <Review>"Forget the words, follow your heart" is this film's oft-repeated Hallmark card sentiment. You may just want to forget the movie and follow the aisle to the exit.</Review>
            <Review>An adequate romantic drama of star-crossed lovers. Good shots of Hong Kong.</Review>

            <Review>There's hardly an area in which Hot Pursuit is not found lacking.</Review>
            <Review>It's actually, actively worse than you think it's going to be.</Review>
            <Review>The dueling accents are meant to be part of some mounting joke, in which each woman sounds like an idiot to the other. It's not funny. Neither is most of the movie, which throws these two at a wall of gags and hopes they stick.</Review>
            <Review>A toothless and nearly laughless buddy comedy.</Review>
            <Review>"Hot Pursuit" features one of the worst and most forced performances of Reese Witherspoon's career, an irritating performance by Sofia Vergara(whom I love on 'Modern Family') and a seemingly endless parade of lazy and arbitrary plot twists and turns.</Review>
            <Review>You could easily imagine these two in a sharper, edgier comedy. Maybe, if Hot Pursuit is a hit, the filmmakers can take a mulligan and reunite them for a faster, funnier sequel.</Review>
            <Review>The film relies far too heavily on the reputations of its two leads and there's very little that surprises throughout the film and it never really even commits to the 'odd-couple' dynamic.</Review>
            <Review>A picture in which every single element conspires to make it feel like a movie you rented one lonely Saturday night back in 1987 and immediately regretted.</Review>
            <Review>Spectacularly misogynist. Every single attempt at humor - all of which fail - comes from abusing and humiliating its central female characters as women.</Review>
            <Review>You won't laugh much, and you're unlikely to remember it.</Review>
            <Review>The only real joke in this so-called comedy is that any of the women who worked on it chose to make it at all.</Review>
            <Review>One of those wannabe-crazy comedies where you almost feel sorry for the stars as they get up to such loudly dorky shenanigans (or you would if they weren't so annoying)</Review>

            <Review>Surprises are few and far between, but what makes it a bit better than average compared to other live-action kids' films is the jaunty banter.</Review>
            <Review>The pic's general good humor - plus the tony adult presence of Gillian Anderson and Ben Kingsley - compensates to some degree for its cheapjack construction, but not enough to extend its appeal far beyond pre-teens in Blighty.</Review>
            <Review>Lively action on a low budget.</Review>
            <Review>While Robot Overlords looks like it's been made on the budget of a Doctor Who episode and features binary acting, there is enough spirit to entertain.</Review>
            <Review>Robot Overlords is an engaging action romp that moves at a nice pace but eventually gets rather let down by effects efforts that are compromised by the film's low-budget origins.</Review>
            <Review>It combines exciting spectacle with heart.</Review>
            <Review>Director Jon Wright, who directed the rambunctious monster-movie Grabbers, makes the most of his limited resources, imbuing the action with an oddly endearing sense of string-and-glue DIY youthfulness.</Review>
            <Review>Robot Overlords would be better as a children's television series than a cinema release, despite the presence of Ben Kingsley and Gillian Anderson.</Review>
            <Review>The film has its attractions - a kind of cutesy quest thronged with delightful, futuristic gadgets - but taken in sum, as the kind of rural cousin of the Transformers series, it offers a gap-toothed smile and little else.</Review>
            <Review>For a low-budget kids' movie, this British science-fiction adventure has an unusually sharp cast, decent effects and...</Review>
            <Review>So much to love in this Brit kiddie sci-fi adventure, with its brilliant concept that really works on a small budget and a real sense of place.</Review>

        <Duration>90</Duration>
        <StoryLine>The film, from the directors of A Brony Tale, I Am Evel Knievel and the upcoming Johnny Cash - American Rebel, tells Chris Farley's story, from his early days in Madison, Wisconsin, and at Marquette University, through his work at the legendary club Second City to his rapid rise to the top of the comedy world on "Saturday Night Live" and in hit films like Tommy Boy and Black Sheep. Sharing insights into the beloved funnyman are such co-stars and colleagues as Christina Applegate, Tom Arnold, Dan Aykroyd, Bo Derek, Pat Finn, Jon Lovitz, Lorne Michaels, Jay Mohr, Mike Myers, Bob Odenkirk, Bob Saget, Adam Sandler, Will Sasso, Molly Shannon, David Spade, Brian Stack and Fred Wolf. The filmmakers also speak to Farley's four siblings, including his brother Kevin, a comedian and actor, and his brother Tom Jr., who wrote the biography "The Chris Farley Show: A Biography in Three Acts."</StoryLine>

            <Review>A bittersweet salute, appraisal and explanation of the early-nineties Saturday Night Live troupe mainstay.</Review>
            <Review>It serves merely to remind us of lightning that struck briefly and memorably in the comedy world, and then was gone.</Review>
            <Review>Fans of Farley will appreciate the effort although more discriminating moviegoers might wish for a little less hagiography and a little more depth.</Review>
            <Review>I kept thinking what Farley would have thought of it. He probably would have been embarrassed and a bit shy about the whole thing. But he would have loved the attention. He would have smiled and laughed. And that's all that really matters.</Review>
            <Review>"I Am Chris Farley" sticks to slickly edited, bite-sized anecdotes about an attention-starved Midwestern goofball unprepared for stardom, accompanied by storybook music that accentuates Farley's childlike nature over his darker impulses.</Review>
            <Review>The story of dependence and excess is sadly familiar - and as with most of its material, "I Am Chris Farley" doesn't find a fresh way to tell it.</Review>
            <Review>Hodge &amp; Murray paint a comprehensive portrait of Farley as a devout Catholic and a devoted friend and brother.</Review>
            <Review>We're left wondering a lot of things, as I Am Chris Farley scratches the surface of Farley's life and death, but never bothers to dig any deeper.</Review>
            <Review>It's a heartwarming but ultimately heartbreaking film that celebrates the life of a unique comic genius without ever sidestepping the personal problems that pushed him ever deeper into the lifestyle excesses that led to his death in 1997, at age 33.</Review>
            <Review>These friendly voices -- and many laugh-out-loud (if too frequently repeated) clips -- aren't exactly helped by a constant drone of spooky piano music</Review>
            <Review>An entertaining yet pervasively superficial documentary...</Review>

            <Review>It's a premise that seems ridiculous until you start to realize it might actually be brilliant, or at least charmingly clever.</Review>
            <Review>I'll admit the film held my attention but I left the theater unsatisfied, which I think will be a common reaction among those not within the demographic niche for which the production was mounted.</Review>
            <Review>You feel some mild critique of lives lived through web applications. What you don't feel is sustained visceral fright.</Review>
            <Review>You might find yourself rooting for the murderer.</Review>
            <Review>If you can give yourself over to the idea of Unfriended,you'll find it's surprisingly engrossing and really quite clever.</Review>
            <Review>Perhaps director Gabriadze and writer Nelson Greaves intended to create a Social Media "Scream" and a commentary on cyber-bullying, but "Unfriended" comes across as disdainful of millennials.</Review>
            <Review>...takes seemingly benign, everyday technology and turns it into a vehicle for menace.</Review>
            <Review>[Cursed with] the common horror movie problem of being unintentionally hilarious.</Review>
            <Review>Little more than digital noise.</Review>
            <Review>Unfriended - previously titled Cybernatural and Offline before that - is the latest cyber variation of the tireless found-footage horror subgenre which fails to bring anything new or novel to the table.</Review>
            <Review>The conceit proves surprisingly inventive and gripping rather than just a gimmick.</Review>
            <Review>The irony of Unfriended is that its target audience is also the social target of its scorn.</Review>

        <StoryLine>When Ruth ruins a baby shower with her drunken, juvenile antics, her old high school cronies, who are all mothers now, promptly de-friend her. But when she is later mistakenly thought to be "with child," she is inexplicably welcomed back into the group. Ruth plans on coming clean, but when her dad has a heart attack and tells her that the only thing keeping him alive is the promise of grandkids, Ruth decides to continue to fake the pregnancy. Things get even more complicated when Ruth falls in love with her new boss, who seems to wants nothing more than to raise her unborn child as his own. Can she get out of this without losing her job, friends, respect of her family, and the new love of her life? This edgy comedy challenges the stereotypes of finding love and motherhood.

            <Review>Pointed social commentary shines through in this uneven but amusing pregnancy farce.</Review>
            <Review>For all the implausible, coincidental and slapstick moments, there's a caustic veracity and trenchant social commentary in "Preggoland" that rings particularly true ...</Review>
            <Review>The movie's flaw is that it mixes tones. Ruth, her relatives and her fellow workers are realistically played, but her gal-pal buddies are caricatures.</Review>
            <Review>There's satiric comedy to be mined from the conflicting messages society still sends about pregnancy, motherhood, and women's worth, but the script isn't smart enough to explore them.</Review>
            <Review>Preggoland feels like a rough cut of a Judd Apatow movie, similarly pushing the taste envelope in cringe-worthy directions before wrapping up with a rom-com bow.</Review>
            <Review>Bennett creates a memorable character in feisty Ruth and there's enough comedy and redemption to make Preggoland an enjoyable romp.</Review>
            <Review>Part Todd Solondz, John Waters, Nicole Holofcener, and Bridesmaids, the bitter and cynical Preggoland is a unique comedy.</Review>
            <Review>A compelling, periodically amusing look at conformity and misunderstanding, finding some fresh material to mine with a plot that's already informed a wide range of comedy projects.</Review>
            <Review>Preggoland is no bundle of joy.</Review>
            <Review>An amusing screwball comedy with a refreshingly complex female lead, but unevenly blended with drama at times.</Review>
            <Review>Throughout, Sonja Bennett embodies slackness as an affectation, not a raw response to a culture of authenticity-killing productivity.</Review>
            <Review>The script slyly pokes fun at the beatification of pregnant women and is smart enough to consider the serious issue of infertility at the same time.</Review>

            <Review>When a play is adapted for the screen, too often you can see the stitches.</Review>
            <Review>It's great fun to watch Patrick Stewart in "Match," seeming to chew scenery (and actually doing so from time to time) but offering something else underneath.</Review>
            <Review>Belber sometimes strains credulity to keep the characters together until the end, but Stewart carries the story to its conclusion with a performance ranging from the fierce to the tender.</Review>
            <Review>This small film (virtually all of it filmed in Tobi's New York apartment) is a real gem.</Review>
            <Review>Onscreen, the material seems contrived and thin. What must have been an electrifying clash of personalities onstage is over the top on film.</Review>
            <Review>The stereotypical fruitiness burns off in the course of the film's revelations, exposing a hoarse, broken, lonely man, and Stewart hits notes of grief I've never heard from him before.</Review>
            <Review>Match swiftly dwindles into the most middlebrow kind of theater. Accusations are hurled, apologies are tendered, grudges are nursed and dismissed, and everyone learns valuable lessons.</Review>
            <Review>Lack of cinematic spectacle is offset by good performances and writing</Review>
            <Review>Match's slightly wooden trajectory is compensated for by Patrick Stewart's compelling performance as the brash, outwardly confident but fundamentally lonely Tobi.</Review>
            <Review>Not that co-stars Gugino and Lillard are subpar, but Stewart has a way of taking the viewer on a specific dramatic journey, gifting "Match" a sense of surprise and buried pain that's always riveting to watch.</Review>
            <Review>Patrick Stewart chews a little scenery, but that's OK.</Review>
            <Review>For a film about a dancer, it's not terribly nimble. By the final act, there are few surprises left. It's worth a look to see Stewart strut his stuff as a real-world human for a change, but not much more.</Review>

            <Review>A little gem.</Review>

            <Review>Hunting Elephants can't even be enjoyed ironically; believe me, I tried.</Review>
            <Review>... despite the best efforts of its cast, Hunting Elephants is a tame comedic excursion into a flimsy world of social lechery and geriatric dysfunction, albeit one that garnered seven Israeli Film Academy Awards nominations.</Review>
            <Review>Decorated with whippy one-liners, Hunting Elephants gets mired in old-fashioned vaudevillian leering.</Review>
            <Review>A few laughs, mostly provided by Patrick Stewart. An edgy Israeli comedy that plays it too safe.</Review>
            <Review>Mostly settles for old-people jokes (now I know the Hebrew for Viagra: it's Viagra) and making Patrick Stewart look like an imbecile.</Review>
            <Review>Reshef Levi's Hunting Elephants was a box-office smash in its native Israel, but much of the humour is clearly the kind that gets lost in translation.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2015</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>96</Duration>
        <StoryLine>THE OUTRAGEOUS SOPHIE TUCKER is the rags to riches story of one of old time showbiz's biggest personalities. From 1906 through the beginning of television, Sophie Tucker and her bawdy, brash, and risqu� songs paved the way for performers such as Mae West, Marilyn Monroe, Bette Midler, Cher, Madonna, Lady Gaga, and Beyonc�. After eight years spent reading hundreds of Tucker's personal scrapbooks, visiting fourteen archives, and interviewing dozens of family, friends, and fellow icons of stage and screen, Susan and Lloyd Ecker have completed their comprehensive documentary about the Last of the Red Hot Mamas. "Sophie was like the Forrest Gump of the first half of the 1900s," says producer Susan Ecker. "She was close friends with seven U.S. presidents, King George VI, young Queen Elizabeth, Charlie Chaplin, J. Edgar Hoover, Al Capone, Judy Garland, Jerry Lewis, Frank Sinatra and every other notable of her era." "After immersing ourselves in Sophie's 400+ personal scrapbooks and meeting all of Tucker's surviving friends and family," says producer Lloyd Ecker, "this film biography is the complete uncensored tale of this vaudeville, Broadway, radio, television and Hollywood legend. Though she obsessively documented her life, Sophie loved to exaggerate for dramatic effect. Over the years, she told multiple versions of each important event. At the end, not even Sophie knew the difference between truth and tall tale". (C) Menemsha Films</StoryLine>

            <Review>Though placing the cheerleading Eckers front and center as key interview subjects gives their film a self-congratulatory, gee-whiz quality, "Outrageous" compensates by giving you a good sense of who Tucker was and how she got where she did.</Review>

            <Review>Sophie Tucker was a great talent that deserves a great film. This isn't it.</Review>

            <Review>Strongest when reveals her innovations in musical style and marketing, weakest when it strings together anecdotes. . . Original materials are seen in constant montages.</Review>

        <StoryLine>In North American folklore the stork delivers babies, but in Russian folklore, babies are born in the cabbage patch. Inspired by the award-winning short film of the same name, PATCH TOWN tells the story of Jon (Rob Ramsay), who has lived a sad life as an oppressed worker at a factory where hundreds of cabbage babies are born. Work on the assembly line is a thankless task of shucking, picking, and processing newborns to go out into the world and to their new adoptive mothers. But when Jon discovers the awful secret that he and all the indentured workers are actually grown-up and discarded toys, he'll have to take on a villainous corporation to reunite with his long-lost mother, protect his newfound family, and finally find freedom.

            <Review>Barthes feels the need to improve on Flaubert, adding and dropping scenes and inventing social metaphors - mainly spiderwebs and corsets.</Review>
            <Review>For a film about passion, it feels oddly flat and often passionless.</Review>
            <Review>With her thousand-mile frown, Mia Wasikowska was born to play Victorian heroines, though she's a little too intelligent and self-aware for Flaubert's Emma Bovary.</Review>
            <Review>This umpteenth adaptation of Flaubert's classic novel at least chooses its Emma wisely ...</Review>
            <Review>For all the talk of romance, this is a Madame Bovary that's grounded in the real - in the sounds and colors of Emma's world, in its material limitations and splendors.</Review>
            <Review>The Normandy locations are evocative, but director Sophie Barthes compresses Emma's multiyear rise and fall into what seems like a month or so.</Review>
            <Review>Incapable of going deeper in its story, the film is a very superficial take on the material. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Mia Wasikowska isn't that bad, but her character lacks all the necessary layers to make us understand her erratic behaviour. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>A faithful adaptation of the mythical novel that stands out thanks to it's great production values. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>By not getting too fancy, Sophie Barthes scores one of the better adaptations with her slightly simplified but reasonably faithful Madame Bovary.</Review>
            <Review>Mia Wasikowska shows that there is no period character that can resist her. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>It is certainly beautiful... But the story, which follows a remorseless arc, is reduced to episodes that amount to a narrative shorthand and many characters - notably Giamatti's Homais - are hopelessly underwritten.</Review>

            <Review>Wild West vengeance gets a terrific homage and a bloody reckoning in this oater excursion ...</Review>
            <Review>Lacks enough complexity to hold cliché at bay, and the CGI-heavy visuals are distracting.</Review>
            <Review>Even when we know the familiar iconography and storytelling tropes of old American classics that are thundering toward us, it's great to see them again.</Review>
            <Review>The Salvation is severe and bloody stuff.</Review>
            <Review>Surprises are few and far between in "The Salvation," but for Western fans looking for a fix, it'll do the trick.</Review>
            <Review>The pace of the film is slow, tense and anxious, built upon a motivation for revenge between two antithetical men, who are united through a shared destructive ideology, cementing the absurdity of human ideals.</Review>
            <Review>The Salvation is an enjoyable film, especially in terms of old-style genre filmmaking. It will certainly become a form of salvation itself, among the hordes of CGI blockbusters and senseless horror flicks that have taken over the theaters this summer.</Review>
            <Review>There's little to really complain about, save a couple of instances of iffy scripting, but the overall sense of familiarity leaves the whole thing feeling not much more than efficiently done.</Review>

        <Title>The Last Survivors (The Well)</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>95</Duration>
        <StoryLine>At the edge of an expansive barren valley, all that remains of The Wallace Farm for Wayward Youth is a few hollowed-out husks of buildings. Seventeen-year-old Kendal (Haley Lu Richardson) can barely recall when the Oregon valley was still lush. It's been a decade since the last rainfall, and society at large has dried up and blown away. Kendal and the few others that remain barely scrape by, while dreaming of escape. When a greedy water baron lays claim to what little of the precious resource remains underground, Kendal must decide whether to run and hide or bravely fight for the few cherished people and things she has left.</StoryLine>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>Hammock may have begun his career making worlds for other directors, but given a chance to create his own here, he not only succeeds but excels.</Review>
            <Review>Hammock's carefully composed widescreen shots of the parched landscape contribute to crafting the film's stripped-down, distinctly menacing visual aesthetic and emphasize the isolation of the inhabitants, forced to compete for water and survival.</Review>
            <Review>At times, like its cast of characters, The Last Survivors looks a little rough around the edges, but it certainly achieves more than its glossy compatriots.</Review>
            <Review>There's nothing really new on the thematic front here, but production designer-turned-director Tom Hammock does wonders with desert vistas and, along with Richardson, has created a sci-fi heroine as real as the girl next door.</Review>
            <Review>It's a film that depends heavily on its central performance. Richardson shines in what was her first major film role, giving Kendal a roundedness rarely seen in either genre.</Review>
            <Review>An attenuated plot (and some very questionable logic) leaves us with a long and wearying Road populated by people with luxurious hair and far-too-neatly-trimmed beards.</Review>
            <Review>A smartly-crafted, lo-fi apocalypse that packs in substantial substance and care for its budget.</Review>
            <Review>This is ultimately an interesting and pretty but rather vacuous failure.</Review>
            <Review>A refreshingly novel take on a rather oft-told apocalypse tale.</Review>
            <Review>The kind of serviceable yet lovingly crafted indie genre picture you wish was made more often.</Review>

        <StoryLine>BLACKBIRD tells the story of seventeen-year-old Randy (Julian Walker), a devout Christian, who, as strong as he seems on the outside, is hiding a secret inner struggle - the denial of being gay. He is also struggling with his life at home since his father (Isaiah Washington) has left, and Randy cares for his emotionally disturbed mother (Mo'Nique).

        <Reviews>
            <Review>The movie places the swoonier love story aspects of Far From the Madding Crowd in the forefront, but it also, more interestingly, surfaces its coming-of-age qualities.</Review>
            <Review>Moviegoers often say, "Forget about the book, even if it's a 'classic.' How does the film work on its own terms?" But that's the point: On its own terms, it's bewildering.</Review>
            <Review>A good, solid version of this novel, guided by Mulligan, is still an achievement.</Review>
            <Review>Vinterberg's classical, pastoral aesthetic recalls the heyday of the Merchant Ivory films, without the corny sentimentality of their lesser imitators.</Review>
            <Review>It's beautifully old and atmospheric without feeling dated.</Review>
            <Review>Carey Mulligan is an inspired choice to play Bathsheba... She's cool and confident; we come to respect her strength and appreciate that she doesn't need a man to be complete.</Review>
            <Review>Madding Crowd would be a lot more effective if Mulligan's feminism didn't disappear to create plot points. But it is suitably well-acted and hits you right in the romance bone.</Review>
            <Review>There is plenty of desire on display here, conveyed in the tremble of the lip or in the intensity of the gaze, or in the deeply saturated colours of a hayfield.</Review>
            <Review>It's really hard to fathom that Denmark's Thomas Vinterberg, co-founder of the radical Dogme 95 Movement with Lars Van Trier, could direct a picture so straight-laced and traditional, so bland and dull.</Review>
            <Review>Such an inflexible adaptation results in a rather half-hearted screenplay that lacks the energy of its source novel, failing to arouse or thrill on any level.</Review>
            <Review>The film's production values are beyond reproach... But the casting disasters and the schematic deliberation of the story make for a flat and empty ending.</Review>
            <Review>Although screenwriter David Nicholls' seriously rushed, trimmed and modified adaptation has created large discrepancies with the book, this ... remains a strangely engrossing film.</Review>

            <Review>The movie hints at a riveting story but is incapable of delivering it.</Review>
            <Review>Given these actors and the ravishing decrepitude of the locations and costumes and the lustrous cinematography of Oliver Wood, I found it more than watchable the whole way through.</Review>
            <Review>Equally bloated and scatterbrained.</Review>
            <Review>"Child 44" is involving despite itself.</Review>
            <Review>[An] unrelentingly grim, plodding, and close-to-incoherent adaptation of Tom Rob Smith's best-selling mystery.</Review>
            <Review>It's as tedious as a bottomless bowl of borscht.</Review>
            <Review>Everyone speaks in pidgin English with thick Russian accents, which reduces the flick to an unintentional farce.</Review>
            <Review>Hardy and Rapace provide a solid emotional anchor as a couple brought together by fear and tightened by survival instinct.</Review>
            <Review>Anchored by two strong lead performances, this film is nothing like the serial killer thriller the trailer suggests. In fact, it is nothing like what you think you are going to get.</Review>
            <Review>It's rare that a movie more than two hours long is criticized for being too short, but there's just so much crammed in, and the speedy clip of events doesn't permit the audience to gain a deep empathy for anyone involved.</Review>
            <Review>Once in a while comes that star-studded film to remind that even the best assemblage of thespians isn't enough to save the most underwhelming of films.</Review>
            <Review>Get past some contrived plotting - and the needlessly thick Russian accents adopted by the mostly British cast - and this 1950s-set crime thriller is grimly fascinating.</Review>

            <Review>In all, Insurgent may work as a deafening, frivolous diversion for viewers who can ignore the flimsiness of its universe, plot, and characters.</Review>
            <Review>Insurgent's convenient scanners affirm its heroine to be 100% Divergent, the most out of everyone, and that's good enough for the story. But it doesn't have to be good enough for the audience.</Review>
            <Review>I appreciate the attempt to try to make this world -- an obliterated, totalitarian Chicago -- as watchable as possible. But there's too much to keep straight.</Review>
            <Review>There's little substance and little depth, but Woodley, with her preternatural poise, offers a worthy simulation of drama.</Review>
            <Review>Insurgent is far too long for the minimal plot it encapsulates, features little in the way of meaningful character development, and is riddled with instances of poorly conceived, contrived developments.</Review>
            <Review>It's all a bit of an unengaging muddle, covered over with concrete grunge, clean white labs, and stagy special effects.</Review>
            <Review>Winslet is an evil wonder to watch. Hair pulled tight and dress pulled tighter, she is unflappable and heartless and it's awesome. Too bad it's in a movie that doesn't quite deserve her.</Review>
            <Review>I said of Divergent last year that it was worth sticking around for the eventual pay-off and that still rings true, but the next installments will have to deliver a pretty heavy payload because Insurgent is hardly likely to start an uprising.</Review>
            <Review>[Tris,] like too many young adult heroines, spends longish periods avoiding her destiny as a leader, choosing to wallow in self-doubt and is moved to action only after checking the feelings of people around her.</Review>
            <Review>Two more films are still to come, Allegiant - parts 1 and 2. Once again the request is simple: more action and less talk next time please.</Review>
            <Review>The only highlights to be found in "Insurgent" are in star Shailene Woodley's cropped hair, a 'do unwittingly symbolic of the cut-rate film it inhabits.</Review>
            <Review>There's a magic box that is very pretty, which, miraculously, is retrieved from Tris's parents home and is the source of all sorts of trouble for her, but don't go looking for logical plot dumps or an actual explanation of what is going on.</Review>

        <StoryLine>A dozen different souls-all moving in different directions, all longing for something more. As their lives unexpectedly intersect, they each are about to discover there is power in the Cross of Christ ... even if they don't believe it. Yet. When a local pastor is shaken to the core by the visible faith of an old street-corner preacher, he is reminded that true belief always requires action. His response ignites a faith-fueled journey that powerfully impacts everyone it touches in ways that only God could orchestrate. This stirring new film from the creators of God's Not Dead arrives in theaters Spring of 2015. More than a movie, it's a question we all must answer in our lifetimes: DO YOU BELIEVE?

            <Review>More professionally produced and acted than the indiegelical norm, but only fitfully engaging on a dramatic level and entirely hermetic on a theological one.</Review>
            <Review>Subtle as a sledgehammer to the toes and only slightly more entertaining ...</Review>
            <Review>Crash, but Jesus-y. Scoffers and doubters will get their smackdown, but even believers should be skeptical at how this ridiculous roundrobin plays out.</Review>
            <Review>The cast is a motley mix of the known and unknown, all doing their best to deliver Konzelman and Solomon's awkward sermon, under Jonathan M. Gunn's equally awkward direction.</Review>
            <Review>For anyone who likes intense drama &amp; great performances</Review>
            <Review>Drama is well-acted but more political than religious.</Review>
            <Review>The cinematic equivalent of a Jehovah's Witness who won't take 'no' for an answer getting his foot stuck in your door.</Review>
            <Review>Is aimed at a targeted audience of believers and fully satisfies them.</Review>
            <Review>It's the same old false shuffle dealt from the same old stacked deck.</Review>

            <Review>True French historians should simply relax and enjoy a film that takes us on a beautifully photographed cinematic romp into a past as it likely SHOULD have been.</Review>
            <Review>"A Little Chaos" wants us to be fascinated by a feminist who never was, then undermines her by casting an approving eye on the steamy affair she begins with her boss.</Review>
            <Review>It's difficult to conjure... excitement for a mess like "A Little Chaos," a lazy and off-puttingly anachronistic feminist fantasy about an 18th-century female landscape designer who finds love while creating... one of the grandest spaces in Versailles.</Review>
            <Review>Mr. Rickman has found in the Sun King a character worthy of his imperious, reptilian charisma.</Review>
            <Review>The story comes to life only fitfully, even with - or perhaps because of - its court intrigue and supporting characters both hissable (Helen McCrory as André's wife) and flamboyant (Stanley Tucci as the king's bisexual brother).</Review>
            <Review>A very little chaos, and more's the pity.</Review>
            <Review>It is all rather too restraint and temperate an affair, hugely lacking the decadence and opulence of French aristocratic life.</Review>
            <Review>A Little Chaos doesn't quite convince as a depiction of life as a 17th century French aristocrat, and is longer than it needs to be, but Madame de Barra's story is an interesting one, and there's plenty to charm green-thumbed film-goers.</Review>
            <Review>Alan Rickman creates a sweet, charming period piece off an anachronistic but committed, beautifully directed performance from Kate Winslet.</Review>
            <Review>Rickman keeps the tone fluffy and occasionally self-aware, and even more so than most costume dramas, you always get the feeling that everyone's playing dress-up.</Review>
            <Review>How to describe that thing where you thoroughly enjoy watching something that is neither objectively good, nor enjoyably bad?</Review>
            <Review>Rickman has created some wonderful scenes for himself to share with his Sense and Sensibility castmate Winslet.</Review>

            <Review>A satisfying enough slice of semi-content suburban life ...</Review>
            <Review>Adult Beginners is a darkly funny indie film about family and second chances.</Review>
            <Review>Adult Beginners has no agenda for subtlety.</Review>
            <Review>"Adult Beginners" is one of those agreeable small-scale movies that doesn't seem particularly ambitious; its only goal is to charm, and it does so, irresistibly.</Review>
            <Review>"Adult Beginners" doesn't reinvent the comeuppance comedy, and it's a better movie because of it.</Review>
            <Review>"Adult Beginners" has enough going on to work as a mostly unchallenging time-passer, and nothing more.</Review>
            <Review>Both an enjoyably modest comedy/drama and a bit of a sales pitch for Nick Kroll, Movie Star.</Review>
            <Review>You've probably already seen every situation writers Jeff Cox and Liz Flahive utilize this month alone and yet it still somehow works.</Review>
            <Review>It's not as sharp or witty as you'd expect from a Duplass Brothers product ion but Adult Beginners is still another decent outing in their ever-impressive canon.</Review>
            <Review>It's a story we've seen a few dozen times before, but first-time director Katz tells it with a nice focus on character.</Review>
            <Review>Kroll's basic task here is fairly lazy and certainly unoriginal.</Review>
            <Review>Kroll is too limited with what he can do with the personality he either has or creates for the film. (I'll go with the former). Twenty lashes with film stock and back to TV for him.</Review>

            <Review>What's the opposite of stealing a movie? Putting it back? Looking the other way? Laziness? Whatever it is, that's where I am with James Franco.</Review>
            <Review>Filming a drama about the compromises and conventions of storytelling, Goold falls prey to them. He lacks the pulp verve and the symbolic imagination to illuminate or even convey the characters' mysteries.</Review>

            <Review>Both characters are so deeply immersed in their own fabrications, any bid at genuine truth is doomed from the beginning. The best part is: We don't care, because we're not expected to like either one.</Review>

            <Review>It's a lot of fun, and Dante's heart is palpably in it.</Review>
            <Review>Even masters have their off days ... and Dante's new picture, "Burying The Ex," seems to have been made over the course of quite a few of them.</Review>
            <Review>Dante has always been at least as much of a comedian as a monster fan, and the film has plenty of gruesome dark humor about embalming fluid and rigor mortis.</Review>
            <Review>The freedom of the director's best work is missing.</Review>
            <Review>"Burying the Ex" is a genre-mashing low for Dante.</Review>
            <Review>How did the guy who made "Gremlins" and "The Howling" direct this cheap-looking, sophomoric, unfunny dreck?</Review>
            <Review>A modest return-to-form [for Joe Dante].</Review>
            <Review>"Burying the Ex" may not be a breakthrough along the lines of "Gremlins," but it is a cheerily macabre lark and a welcome fresh entry to Dante's oeuvre.</Review>
            <Review>Joe Dante has gifted the world great cinematic treats, such as creature feature Gremlins, sci-fi comedy adventure Innerspace, and the love letter to the cinema, Matinee. Alas, Burying the Ex will not be thought of with such reverence in the future.</Review>
            <Review>For Dante's reputation, it would be best that the movie should itself be buried without an identifying headstone.</Review>
            <Review>First, the bad news. This is Joe Dante's worst film. There is no good news.</Review>
            <Review>Despite some endearing performances and an amusing throwback vibe, the film runs predictably through a threadbare concept that isn't consistently funny or scary.</Review>

            <Review>Strouse's strong suit is his casting. His writing and directing are solid, but his ability to select the right actor makes all the difference in "Teacher of the Year".</Review>
            <Review>Thanks to a highly-skilled group of comedic actors with years of experience --- largely honed on television --- and the absurdist humor of writer/director Jason Strouse, "Teacher of the Year" is a film I can heartily recommend.</Review>
            <Review>Teacher of the Year is a smart and funny movie that manages to pull off one of the more difficult balancing acts in filmmaking; it actually is smart while still being funny.&gt;</Review>
            <Review>This excellent mockumentary highlights the business of teaching high-school kids to hilarious and poignant effect.</Review>
            <Review>With a strong ensemble cast... It uses the documentary style in an effective manner that kept the character beats consistent with the laughs and felt like a true winner.</Review>
            <Review>It's a grade above most high school comedies that trade on sexualized teens, a laugh-out-loud, sweetly-irreverent-but-never-raunchy look at education from the inside out.</Review>

        <Duration>75</Duration>
        <StoryLine>The War On Cancer, launched in the early 1970s, set the stage for a massive influx of new ideas in fighting the disease of cancer. Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, America's leading cancer research center at the time, was assigned the task of testing an unconventional therapy called "Laetrile" in an effort to curb the public's "false hope" in the alleged "quack" therapy. Ralph W. Moss PhD, a young and eager science writer, was hired by Sloan-Kettering's public relations department in 1974 to help brief the American public on the center's contribution to the War On Cancer. One of his first assignments was to write a biography about Dr. Kanematsu Sugiura, one of the Center's oldest and leading research scientists as well as the original co-inventor of chemotherapy.

            <Review>By the time the film gets where it's going, viewers may identify more than they expect with those who've been controlled by others with hidden agendas.</Review>
            <Review>Its final reveal is the sort of beautiful Twilight Zone fillip you see coming only about 10 seconds before it arrives, and I recommend seeing the movie without reading anything further about it: The payoff is that good.</Review>
            <Review>The strongest aspects of "Faults" stem from its completely unpredictable atmosphere. You might anticipate the twists before they arrive, but not the way they feel.</Review>
            <Review>"Faults" is a richly-textured movie that concerns the weird space between thinking you know what you're doing, and actually knowing what you're doing.</Review>
            <Review>The wan drama is enlivened by bursts of black comedy, some bits more effective than others, and though it ultimately disappoints, there's promise in the understated creepiness of Riley Stearns' debut feature.</Review>
            <Review>While "Faults" glances at the narcissism of cult leaders, its most penetrating investigation is into the root emptiness within disciples, the desperate hunger to relinquish personal initiative.</Review>
            <Review>Stearns crafts a slow-forming film, establishing atmosphere and tension.</Review>
            <Review>Faults is a taught and charismatic work, and also the latest film to tackle the subject of cults in a quietly earnest way.</Review>
            <Review>We'd recommend knowing as little about it as possible, but we'll open by saying that it's funny, it's puzzling, and it's utterly beguiling.</Review>
            <Review>Psychologically thrilling, yet oddly and darkly comic at times, Faults is an intense character study that gets under your skin and sends chills up your spine.</Review>
            <Review>There are indeed some faults, but not enough to derail the fascinating mind games being staged in this low-budget drama.</Review>
            <Review>Faults is at times horrifyingly funny-before it becomes just plain horrifying-carried by stellar performances even when it falters.</Review>

            <Review>A fun thriller that'll have you reaching for the travel brochures.</Review>
            <Review>It feels like a typical action movie that's been sawed off and sanded down - its blunt edges sharpened, its soft center drained out. It's not particularly original, but it is mean, relentless, and bracing.</Review>
            <Review>"The Dead Lands" doesn't add up to much, but it is always on the verge of becoming more than just a bed time story for guys that wish "Braveheart" had a biceps-kissing baby with "Ong Bak."</Review>
            <Review>A fable about New Zealand's indigenous Maori people before the arrival of European settlers, "The Dead Lands" values entertainment over archaeology.</Review>
            <Review>Action fans will enjoy the fight scenes while the rest of us may find the film perversely interesting from a socio-anthropological perspective.</Review>
            <Review>Honor and shame are frequently announced concerns in the story, and the staginess recalls Mr. Fraser's experience as a theater director.</Review>
            <Review>It's in te reo but The Dead Lands never feels like it's trying too hard to say anything important. All the same, it may well become a very important film.</Review>
            <Review>It certainly makes viewers reluctant to hassle anyone carrying a patu with authority, which is something the film can hang its hat on.</Review>
            <Review>Situating death as the catalyst to action whereby legends, apparitions and spirits mobilize the command to vengeance, Fraser's narrative teems and trounces with relentless bloodshed, slaughter, violence and gore.</Review>
            <Review>Seldom have I seen a more foreign film than this one. This is a story set, not only in a language, Te Reo, totally separate from Indo-European languages, but in a very different time and culture, as well.</Review>
            <Review>A grisly, Maori revenge flick tailor-made for fans of high body-count fare.</Review>
            <Review>Highly entertaining.</Review>

            <Review>The film feels like an uncomfortable hodgepodge of styles and tones - gritty and realistic when it's following Ryan, awkwardly staged when it's following Jackie.</Review>
            <Review>If a film based on author Nicholas Sparks' work is like an over-produced power ballad with a 128-piece orchestra, writer/director Ami Canaan Mann's "Jackie &amp; Ryan" is the non-ironic acoustic guitar cover of the same tune.</Review>
            <Review>"Jackie &amp; Ryan" may prove too low-key and deliberately paced for less patient viewers, but distinct pleasures are to be had from this compactly shot film's easy rhythms, affecting tone and nicely modulated performances.</Review>
            <Review>You anticipate a cheap, sentimental ending. But it is not to be, and the movie is much the better for it.</Review>
            <Review>The section of the movie that should offer a climactic rush, however fleeting, feels instead more like falling action, or even a postscript.</Review>
            <Review>Jackie &amp; Ryan is a sort of low-rent Nicholas Sparks romance that, for want of a better way to put it, never generates any sparks of its own.</Review>
            <Review>There's a familiar tune to this modest low-budget romance about musicians who fall in love, yet it's given a fresh spin by a set of charming performances and a screenplay that generally sidesteps cliches.</Review>
            <Review>Sweet if unexciting love story about two musicians.</Review>
            <Review>A tender romantic drama about two music lovers who face steep and unruly challenges during hard times.</Review>
            <Review>A romance of a gentle, bittersweet, grownup variety that doesn't pretend that every connection has to be a grand, sweeping, happily-ever-after thing.</Review>
            <Review>It's refreshing to see a romance-even a slightly tepid one-that acknowledges and even embraces its transient nature.</Review>
            <Review>"Jackie &amp; Ryan" isn't profound work, but it carries real heart and private moments of panic.</Review>

A family of vampires, bored with immortality, lives in Belgium, eats illegal immigrants, children, handicapped folk, and takes every advantage they can suck out of the country's social system. Samson, a seventies throwback, lives his 55th year like he's forever 20. Grace, an eternal teenager bent on being human again, keeps committing suicide. George, the patriarch, manages as best he can, heading the eccentric family and its on-going squabbles with the neighboring vampires. It turns out vampires must keep to a strict code. They are, for example, prohibited from sleeping with their leader's wife. That's where Samson went too far... Now he and his whole family are exiled to Quebec, where even vampires have to work for a living! -- (C) IFC</StoryLine>

        <Duration>114</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Directed by Sophie Hyde (Shut Up Little Man! An Audio Misadventure), the Australian filmmaker who won the Directing Award: World Cinema Dramatic at last year's Sundance Film Festival, 52 TUESDAYS is centered on the relationship between James (Del Herbert-Jane), a mother undergoing gender transition, and her precocious teenage daughter Billie (Tilda Cobham-Hervey). Looking forward to starting his gender transition but weary of how the process might affect his daughter, James asks Billie to move in with her father Tom (played by Beau Travis Williams). To make up for the abrupt separation, mother and daughter make a commitment to meet every Tuesday afternoon, no matter what. As the year progresses, James and Billie watch each other change in ways that sometimes threaten their once-unshakable relationship. As both individuals explore deep personal issues and struggle to remain connected, a complex tale of human desire and ultimately, physical and psychological transformation, emerges.

        <StoryLine>Five college students travel to a small Texas town to research the Legend of Blood Lake, an obscure folktale forged by events surrounding the massacre of a Comanche village by a company of Texas Rangers in the 1800s. Reports of people having disappeared from the area have mounted over the years, giving rise to incredible tales of evil spirits who protect a sacred cache of gold that lies beneath the surface of the lake. A crusty old bartender cautions the students to mind their own business and go back home, but they are approached by a beautiful young woman who offers to take them to the lake. It's not long before they begin to realize that the legend is much more than local folklore when they come face-to-face with their own pasts and the legend itself. (C) Indican</StoryLine>

            <Review>Justin Long is a fine actor, but you have to like him a lot to get through "Comet," Sam Esmail's trippy, overly mannered romance.</Review>
            <Review>Watching a not-very-interesting couple break up is one thing; watching them break up and get back together numerous times in different universes and dimensions is, well ... to paraphrase "Jaws," I'm going to need a bigger popcorn bag.</Review>
            <Review>Its conceits ... get in the way of its characters, making it feel fussy and convoluted when it aims for something more simple and elegant.</Review>
            <Review>Yes, some of it is overwritten and a bit too clever for its own good, but more often it's an engaging character piece.</Review>
            <Review>These occasionally obnoxious, certainly neurotic young lovers have beating, sometimes broken hearts, and that, as the apostle Paul once noted, tends to trump all.</Review>
            <Review>There's a lot of gorgeous, sci-fi inspired cinematography here by Eric Koretz, but none seem as intriguing as the ones depicting Kimberly's face or Dell's gaze as he watches her.</Review>
            <Review>An ambitious and striking effort.</Review>
            <Review>Tedious romantic dramedy with a pointless sci-fi tinge that has nothing in the least bit memorable to say about anything at all.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>This fifth feature by the brilliant Argentine filmmaker Lisandro Alonso is his first with professional actors and a period setting, yet it meshes thematically with his other work.</Review>
            <Review>Alonso sustains an atmosphere of otherworldly immanence in a vivid setting, with a style involving long takes with characters posed as if in tableaux vivants.</Review>
            <Review>Viewers who can accept a defiantly slow pace, a few loose plot threads and a directorial style that works by intimation, will be rewarded.</Review>
            <Review>If you applauded the genre-tweaking twists of Gus Van Sant's "Gerry" and Kelly Reichardt's "Meek's Cutoff," you may have a good time (or at least an interesting one) at acclaimed Argentine director Lisandro Alonso's latest puzzler, "Jauja."</Review>
            <Review>'Jauja' is a film to make you wonder.</Review>
            <Review>"Jauja" makes one cryptic leap too many at the end, but until then it evocatively confounds.</Review>
            <Review>[A] strange, beguiling, and excitedly didactic film.</Review>
            <Review>You've got walking in grass, riding a horse through grass, and sitting amid the grass. A few grisly kills. But mostly there's grass. And it grows. Green. Sometimes yellow.</Review>
            <Review>Imagine Carl Theodor Dreyer, with a dash of Herzog, directing a surreal 50s Technicolor western and you might have some idea of what to expect from Lisandro Alonso's baffling yet transfixing Jauja.</Review>
            <Review>With Jauja Alonso follows the ever-widening orbit his films have been tracing even further, nudging his trademark concerns... of his earlier work into something considerably more expansive, playful, even supernatural.</Review>
            <Review>Jauja feels less like a film than a hazy dream of postcards from nowhere.</Review>
            <Review>As a micro-critique of colonialism, the film resonates alongside Werner Herzog's Aguirre, the Wrath of God (1972) and Michelangelo Antonioni's The Passenger (1975), among others, all road movies leading nowhere.</Review>

            <Review>Indeed, this is the 51-year-old Crowe's first time as a movie director, but he's hardly a novice actor stepping behind the camera for some sort of vanity project.</Review>
            <Review>It's clear that Russell Crowe has poured his heart and soul into the historical romance The Water Diviner, his first feature as a director. If only the film were better.</Review>
            <Review>A sloggy, heartfelt piece of quasi-magical realist storytelling.</Review>
            <Review>Crowe strives to strike a universal chord about the futility of war. Simplistic? Maybe. But in crafting a film about the pain a parent feels after losing a child in battle, Crowe transcends borders and politics.</Review>
            <Review>Crowe needs, badly, a director to push back against his default mode: The script for The Water Diviner posits that Joshua Connor is the most interesting man in the frame at all times, but Crowe's performance doesn't earn that.</Review>
            <Review>Even slightly self-censored, its images of broken cities and the walking wounded is a strong restating of the film's message: There is no such thing as a "good" war. There's only war - sometimes necessary, sometimes not. And always inhuman.</Review>
            <Review>The preposterousness of [the story] is offset by Crowe's powerful depiction of the horrors of war for both the Australians and Turks.</Review>
            <Review>[This is] for the tiresome cynics who think that many films aren't about anything anymore, and would rather a film be definitively about something, than any good overall.</Review>
            <Review>Crowe perfectly plays a dad going in search of the three sons believed to have been killed in action at Gallipoli in the First World War.</Review>
            <Review>As expected, what an actor-turned-director like Crowe can do is pull strong performances out of his cast.</Review>
            <Review>A well-meaning, worthy and, at times, moving ode to Gallipoli.</Review>
            <Review>The Water Diviner feels almost too careful in its desire to hit all the right notes and do justice to all sides. Which makes it more of a war memorial than a living, breathing movie.</Review>

            <Review>If someone wants to make a case that our four-legged actor friends deserve to be considered for Oscar consideration, right alongside Streep and McConaughey, they need only offer White God as evidence.</Review>
            <Review>What it all means is open to interpretation. Read it as a parable or as a horror movie. Read it as the story of love between a girl and her dog. Read it however you want. No matter what your take, you won't be disappointed.</Review>
            <Review>White God offers a dark - very dark - take on the way humans exert authority, and superiority, over our fellow creatures.</Review>
            <Review>The obviousness of the message -- follow the right leader -- would be more tolerable in a less badly acted, less shoddy-looking film.</Review>
            <Review>A mixed-genre fable that evokes Dickensian melodrama, coming-of-age tropes and outright horror.</Review>
            <Review>Think "The Incredible Journey" crossed with "The Birds" crossed with "Rise of the Planet of the Apes." Or maybe just imagine "Cujo" as told from the dog's point of view. Don't take grandma.</Review>
            <Review>Through Hagen's journey into the pit of madness, this strange film, directed by Kornél Mundruczó, becomes a thriller, a parable, as well as a tough critique of the way men assume superiority over nature.</Review>
            <Review>Mundruczó's focus is clearly going to the admittedly impressive execution, but White God lacks the narrative weight to leave an impact.</Review>
            <Review>This unique Hungarian fable about racism and immigration is told from the point of view of dogs and children.</Review>
            <Review>Although bold and intermittently gripping, the end result smacks of overreaching.</Review>
            <Review>Reads as a stylized conceit, undercut by too many little moments when performances, from human and canine alike, don't truthfully express what the movie says they do.</Review>
            <Review>Hopefully someday Hollywood will be able to make films as great as this one. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>

            <Review>It doesn't make for the strongest film, but it does work like a case of people swapping outrageous war stories over a few beers.</Review>
            <Review>Gregory might have done a bit more to differentiate this more extensive investigation from those earlier pics' conventions. But the richness of the tale told here makes this competently packaged feature a keeper nonetheless.</Review>
            <Review>Some of the worst movies give way to the best documentaries...</Review>
            <Review>Whether you remember the actual movie or not, "Lost Soul" is an excellent dissection of a multi-million-dollar movie gone off the rails.</Review>
            <Review>A wildly entertaining effort and a must-see for anyone who walked out of The Island of Dr. Moreau confused and maybe a little irritated.</Review>
            <Review>Richard Stanley's vision of Wells' hellish utopia never materialized, but its legacy makes for an appropriately insane real-life narrative every bit as brilliantly mad and maddening as the fiction promised to be.</Review>
            <Review>If you love [Moreau] as I do, or are even simply fascinated by its chaos for totally ironic reasons, this documentary is a must-watch.</Review>
            <Review>a making-of for a film that never got made - or at least never as intended.... The anecdotes here are frank and fascinating, and there are few raconteurs more mesmerising than Stanley.</Review>

            <Review>Heartwarming and harmless? Sure, why not. But it's also numbing in its simplicity and often rather annoying.</Review>
            <Review>The combination of Home's layered message, fun score, and clever comedy make it a colorful choice for moviegoers of any age.</Review>
            <Review>Anyone over 10 will see the plot twists a mile away. Kids will probably enjoy the goofy Boovs, the rainbows of colors and the music. Call me a traditionalist, but I still say the world was a better place before those darn Boovs invaded.</Review>
            <Review>A surprisingly moving tale of friendship and family, dressed up as an adorably frivolous sci-fi comedy.</Review>
            <Review>Maybe it's because kids sometimes feel like aliens in a grown-up world, but from E.T. and Elliott to Lilo and Stitch, pairing a child with a creature from outer space can prove to be a winning combination.</Review>
            <Review>A big, fat happy meal of a movie ...</Review>
            <Review>Mostly this is one is for the kids. Some quick-witted humour aside there's little new for parents to enjoy, but the offspring will enjoy the snappy pacing, colourful animation and wacky ideas.</Review>
            <Review>Home takes an actual science-fiction story, admittedly toned down and geared towards the younger set, and grinds it up and blends it down into another homogenized family product.</Review>
            <Review>Home is more or less premised on refuting this cruel binary, encouraging kids to rethink conventions or family and otherness, fearfulness and he security of "home".</Review>
            <Review>While adults will be unmoved by this loud, fast-paced movie -- the cinematic equivalent of mainlining liquid Haribo -- younger viewers will lap up the kaleidoscopic aliens and sentimental life lessons.</Review>
            <Review>Not only is the hero a smart, brave 7th-grade girl but she's also an immigrant from Barbados, and a self-described nerd who got an A in geometry. She's even a cat owner. Well done, DreamWorks.</Review>
            <Review>It doesn't have the richness or depth that Pixar frequently lays claim to, but it's still a pleasing endeavor.</Review>

            <Review>Promising work that's worth checking out.</Review>
            <Review>The low energy pace and performances strive for naturalism but just don't achieve compelling tension or suspense.</Review>
            <Review>This isn't a perfect movie... But I can say without hesitation that if you want to be able to say you were there when a great American filmmaker's career kicked off, you need to see Runoff.</Review>
            <Review>The 90-minute movie is a tightly compressed exploration of forces that make it next to impossible to operate a small business when a voracious corporation moves in for the kill.</Review>
            <Review>Even when Levin's symbolism is a little on the nose, these elements are balanced with enough small details and moments that they blend in to the larger texture of the characters' lives.</Review>
            <Review>The movie achieves an understated resonance through Levin's emotionally sensitive compositions and her clued-in portrayal of life in a middle-American farming community.</Review>
            <Review>Levin dares something practically unheard of in modern Hollywood movies: she asks the audience to watch, feel, and come to their own conclusions.</Review>
            <Review>A little too reluctant to take a stand against chemicals but worth seeing for its empathy for its main character who is forced to carry out a crime that puts her in league with Monsanto.</Review>
            <Review>An intelligent, sophisticated and mesmerizing slow-burn thriller that's grounded in humanism. Patient viewers will be rewarded the most.</Review>
            <Review>Truly, Runoff can be an uncomfortable film to watch -- both because Levin's subject matter is supposed to make us uncomfortable and because her film leaves so much untended, is in the end so uneven.</Review>
            <Review>This emotionally affecting film never loses sight of the ethical complexity of forsaking a community in the name of an individual.</Review>
            <Review>Intelligent and entertaining, Runoff moves its audience from what was perhaps a vague, wistful notion of the rural existence of family farming to witness the harsh realities of a tragically disappearing American way of life</Review>

A thwarted plan for a second meeting sends each in a separate direction - Sylvie reunites with her ex and leaves France; Marc falls in love and marries. What neither knows is that Marc's new bride is Sylvie's sister, Sophie (Chiara Mastroianni).

            <Review>As much as it hopes to incite outrage and to stir a complacent body politic into action, [it] never quite rises to the level of urgency the subject requires.</Review>
            <Review>A blistering attack on politicians, propagandists, dissemblers and other climate-change deniers.</Review>
            <Review>The film's effectiveness largely stems from the flat-out lameness of the opposition arguments, the lack of scientific credentials of those making them, and the self-interest of their corporate bosses.</Review>
            <Review>Filmmaker Craig Scott Rosebraugh seems to take a kind of perverse glee in hauling out the worst offenders among what he calls the climate change deniers for public shaming.</Review>
            <Review>What's next, "Big Oil Is Full of Meanies"?</Review>
            <Review>The film makes its case well. The problem, though, is it seems a bit late.</Review>
            <Review>If ever a documentary needed Michael Moore's ability to debunk the rich and powerful in his inimitable sardonic style, it's here.</Review>
            <Review>It is a splenetic, satiric attack on the formidable PR forces, spurious thinktanks and talking heads being mobilised in the US to attack the idea of man-made global warming.</Review>
            <Review>If you like being hectored, preached at and told you're wrong, then this is the film for you.</Review>
            <Review>Craig Scott Rosebraugh delivers an informative if somewhat self-satisfied expose of climate change deniers, explaining exactly where they get their funding from and how they are determined to dupe the public despite the devastating consequences.</Review>
            <Review>This film is an awful warning and awful fun at one and the same time.</Review>
            <Review>A fiery doc that undermines itself with pub-bore polemics.</Review>

            <Review>Although there have been worse sequels -- and worse overall movies -- make no mistake, that's hardly a recommendation.</Review>
            <Review>Maybe Paul Blart isn't spoofing John McClane after all; maybe these movies are actually too stupid to realize what they're imitating.</Review>
            <Review>Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be forgettable, but it's difficult to truly dislike.</Review>
            <Review>A movie whose chuckles (six, I counted) are outnumbered by helicopter shots of the Wynn resort in Las Vegas.</Review>
            <Review>You won't find much offensive in Kevin James's slick, innocuous vehicle Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. You won't find much prompting an emotional reaction in general, so familiar are the jokes and situations.</Review>
            <Review>Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Speed 2. To this small sample of the ever-expanding list of wretched movie sequels, add Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, a gobsmackingly witless excuse for entertainment.</Review>
            <Review>This follow-up to the 2009 original is even more terminally dumb and dopey, with co-writer, co-producer and star Kevin James hamming it up horribly.</Review>
            <Review>As expected, all the humour involves his bumping into things and falling over because he's fat, which is apparently hilarious.</Review>
            <Review>Not about the every man hero, it's about the fat slob working class and how we should laugh at them and not with them.</Review>
            <Review>Forget the whole "Whatever happens in Vegas stays in Vegas" spiel; Officer Blart should have done us all a solid and stayed in Jersey with his Segway.</Review>
            <Review>The Blart jokes hobble along again here. What's new is an added layer of misjudgment (e.g., tasing someone five times). The only cringe to this comedy comes with the stereotypes: a no-nonsense black woman who drops slang; a snotty young Latino hotshot.</Review>
            <Review>Surprising notes of meanness and bitterness.</Review>

            <Review>If Twilight made you queasy and Dark Shadows felt like a missed opportunity, this pitch-perfect genre spoof is worth relishing.</Review>
            <Review>I'm so sick of vampires I'd have pounded a stake into my own heart not to have to watch this, but it turns out to be a pitch-perfect spoof of MTV's The Real World and a sly satire on millennial slackerdom.</Review>
            <Review>The New Zealand-made art comedy What We Do in the Shadows is a bracing reminder of how the right burst of energy and style breathes fresh ideas into a genre threatened with creative exhaustion.</Review>
            <Review>If we see two or three more comedies this year that know what they're doing the way this one does, it'll be a very good year indeed.</Review>
            <Review>Maybe it's something in the water Down Under, but these fellows have managed to concoct a whole new perspective on fangsters.</Review>
            <Review>Shadows takes what could have been a one-joke sketch and turns it into a very funny, and occasionally even touching, take on brotherhood and friendship...It's certainly more authentic and realistic than recent seasons of The Real World.</Review>
            <Review>It's warm, charming and hilarious - I could have died from laughing.</Review>
            <Review>What We Do in the Shadows is proof that the vampire genre is alive and well as long as it's in the right hands.</Review>
            <Review>Mark my words, there is something very funny going on here.</Review>
            <Review>The shaggy aimlessness inherent to improvised buddy comedy is jarringly stitched to the gloomy Gothic weight of the cinematography and production design, to excellent effect.</Review>
            <Review>Just about every monster movie convention gets tweaked here and there, but it never feels like Shadows is forcing the issue to tick off another box.</Review>
            <Review>Clement and Waititi mine gold from each of its 85 minutes, giving the world its best horror-comedy since Edgar Wright's "Shaun Of The Dead."</Review>

            <Review>Though the themes about war and peace will be familiar, this is good, old-fashioned storytelling - with a high level of craftsmanship.</Review>
            <Review>It is difficult not to be moved by "Tangerines," which begins to feel like a legend despite one's nagging sense something is missing from the film's hasty third act.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director Zaza Urushadze turns this fragile premise into a superior chamber drama.</Review>
            <Review>Tangerines, the first Estonian picture nominated for the foreign-film Oscar, has a heart as ripe as the citrus fruit of its title, but its message doesn't yield much juice.</Review>
            <Review>The acting is solid; Ulfsak is ideally cast as the easygoing, timeworn woodworker.</Review>
            <Review>Georgian writer-director Zaza Urushadze avoids histrionics or moralizing, relying on a strong cast that expresses the film's central argument about war's absurdity largely through taciturn action, not words.</Review>
            <Review>An oustanding and emotional movie. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Ulfsak, by all accounts Estonia's Olivier, is the pivot of the all-male cast, his mournful face bringing an intense gravitas to proceedings in an small, but engrossing and handsome film.</Review>
            <Review>It represents the horrors of war in a small town setting. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>A conventional war drama that is perfectly made and acted. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>The simple nature and sobriety of this tale, along its bittersweet ending and the transparency of its message, make it, in the end, an homage to anti-militarism cinema.[Full Review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Those faultless performances make something special of the material. Many will find it disconcerting to be reminded of the many conflicts... that blew up following the fall of the Soviet empire. Worth cherishing.</Review>

        <StoryLine>A vicious killer, Feng, is going round Hong Kong killing top martial arts exponents, leaving a secret weapon called the Moonshadow as his calling card. When convicted killer and kung fu expert, Xia, hears of this, he offers to help the police catch the killer, in return for his freedom. Despite their misgivings, the police release the former police martial arts instructor into their custody. With his help, they realize from the chronological order of the victims that the killer is targeting his victims, all the top masters in their martial arts style, following a martial code of training. When Xia also disappears after a close encounter with Feng, they suspect the worse: that the two are accomplices and Feng was the bait to help spring Xia from jail. But Xia has actually gone back to his home in Foshan to find out more about the mysterious calling card. While doing so, he discovers the killer's identity and his motivation: the true philosophy behind martial arts was to kill opponents who were weaker than him. Steadfastly, Xia refuses to be drawn into a fight with Feng - until the killer threatens the women he loves most. Only then does he realize that he would have to go against the martial code in order to uphold it.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Kung Fu Killer manages to be your better-than-average chop-socky fun for a couple of reasons, starting with veteran actor Donnie Yen in the lead as Mo Hahou, who can fight and emote with equal proficiency.</Review>
            <Review>This isn't a new golden age of martial arts films, but with Yen holding down the fort in China and southeast Asian fighters Iko Uwais and Tony Jaa, it's a pretty good one.</Review>
            <Review>Here, in this entertaining, preposterous goof of a kung fu movie, are all those values missing from the mainstream of American action filmmaking ...</Review>
            <Review>An undeniably bland film in style and story, despite a few elaborately staged fight sequences.</Review>
            <Review>Part of the fun of watching this film is counting how many cameos you can spot.</Review>
            <Review>It's an exciting watch, but more than that it's a respectful appreciation of Hong Kong cinema and all those who came before.</Review>

            <Review>Gorgeous, evocative and well performed ...</Review>
            <Review>The film wallows too much in its subject's glumness, but it comes alive whenever TV actor and co-writer Celyn Jones, whose only previous film credit is 2005's Lassie, plays Thomas as a big shaggy dog.</Review>
            <Review>As tedious as "Set Fire to the Stars" gets, it remains watchable courtesy of the stunning black and white cinematography by Chris Seager.</Review>
            <Review>"Set Fire to the Stars" barely skims the surface of characters you wish had been given more dimension, but as a snapshot of postwar academia and its pretensions, it exerts a creepy fascination.</Review>
            <Review>Stylistically assured and tastefully appointed.</Review>
            <Review>[A] watchable but thematically repetitive drama about Welsh poet Dylan Thomas' arrival in America in 1950.</Review>
            <Review>Shot in jazzy black and white by cinematographer Chris Seager, and thundering with taste and tempo, Andy Goddard's film just sings.</Review>
            <Review>Set Fire belongs to a genre that might be called Close Encounters With Greatness. They're not biopics, but glancing views by nobodies in a position to observe the backstage workings of genius. It's a formula, and Set Fire never gets beyond that formula.</Review>
            <Review>Although the screenplay lacks insight into his creative process, the film playfully dissects stuffy postwar academic ostentation.</Review>
            <Review>Set Fire to the Stars may be thematically uneven, but the aforementioned performances and Chris Seager's cinematography more than make up for it.</Review>
            <Review>Story of the love/hate relationship between the Welsh poet Dylan Thomas and his tour-agent during his first visit to America.</Review>
            <Review>It's a terrifically rounded portrait that captures both Thomas's depressive neuroses and his zest for life.</Review>

            <Review>[Duvall] loses the thread - and our attention - one too many times in a sea of lackluster conversations and unremarkable plot strands.</Review>
            <Review>Could Robert Duvall's incoherent melodrama "Wild Horses" have been salvaged by a skillful editor? Probably not.</Review>
            <Review>What a shambles.</Review>
            <Review>These competing narratives are connected haphazardly by visual transitions that feel like someone sat on the DVD remote, plus jarring tonal shifts between intimate conversations and tire-spinning car chases.</Review>
            <Review>The theatrical performances don't come close to matching Duvall's 1997 directing breakthrough The Apostle.</Review>
            <Review>It's a mess, a complete and utter mess, but shockingly, the movie is rarely dull, embracing just enough of Duvall's dedication to realism to make it bearable.</Review>
            <Review>Robert Duvall's evident admiration for his wife are typical of this film, in which so much seems touchingly sincere but clumsily expressed.</Review>
            <Review>While far from perfect, Wild Horses has strong enough performances from its leads to make it an enjoyable and worthwhile modern western.</Review>
            <Review>There isn't even anything wrong with this being a bad movie; it's just too bad that it is.</Review>
            <Review>The final title card deems the movie "a tale that is told," but like that fragmentary statement, Wild Horses has nothing fresh to say.</Review>
            <Review>Tonally dissonant and narratively disjointed, "Wild Horses" plays like a patchwork quilt of scenes excerpted from a much longer movie, or maybe even a miniseries.</Review>

        <Title>Gore Vidal: The United States Of Amnesia</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>89</Duration>
        <StoryLine>No twentieth-century figure has had a more profound effect on the worlds of literature, film, politics, historical debate, and the culture wars than Gore Vidal. Anchored by intimate one-on-one interviews with the man himself, Nicholas Wrathall's new documentary is a fascinating and wholly entertaining portrait of the last lion of the age of American liberalism. Commentary by those who knew him best-including filmmaker/nephew Burr Steers and the late Christopher Hitchens-blends with footage from Vidal's legendary on-air career to remind us why he will forever stand as one of the most brilliant and fearless critics of our time. Gore Vidal's professional life spans more than 50 years of American politics and letters. His return to America in 2005 marked the last great stage in his creative career and this film represents an extraordinary opportunity to share his view on America in the twenty-first century. Featuring candid v�rit� footage of Vidal in his final years, the film explores his enduring global impact on art, politics, and everything in between. His overview of the current state of the Republic and the health of US democracy is unique and incisive. This is Gore Vidal's last word and testimony. (c) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>[Filmmaker Nicholas D. Wrathall] couldn't have asked for a more striking scene than the one in which the writer shows him the grave he plans to occupy (beside his longtime companion, Howard Austen, who died in 2003).</Review>
            <Review>Vidal was our last great Roman senator, mourning the republic as he gazed at a corrupt empire. "Whenever I want to know what the United States is up to," he said, "I look into my own black heart."</Review>
            <Review>Asked at the film's conclusion what he expects his legacy will be, he replies, "I couldn't care less," ornery to the last. Viewers who encounter him for the first time through this film will no doubt share the sentiment.</Review>
            <Review>We watch before our eyes as Vidal goes from an impossibly handsome young man to a broken-down old one, and age does nothing for his mood.</Review>
            <Review>Remarkably enjoyable, even joyous, the film chronicles Vidal's life from his privileged beginnings, his years at some of the country's most elite prep schools, and his shocking decision to join the Army instead of attend college.</Review>
            <Review>It is especially odd, given the movie's subtitle, that "Gore Vidal" takes so long to get around to explaining the roots of Vidal's famous cynicism about this country's politics.</Review>
            <Review>Engaging and challenging in moments, it stumbles to the challenge.</Review>
            <Review>It seems to exist only because Wrathall had the footage.</Review>
            <Review>...a smart and entertaining movie that can fairly be described as fun.</Review>
            <Review>He was the ultimate insider who shaped himself into the epitome of the pesky outsider.</Review>
            <Review>Filmmaker Nicholas Wrathall takes viewers on a brisk, amusing promenade through Vidal's enviable life: wealthy, globe-hopping, pals of the talented and famous.</Review>
            <Review>It's not a filling cinematic meal, but juicy morsels of candor and a chance to acquire a deeper appreciation for Vidal's epic ego are worth the price of admission.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>It meditates long and hard on questions of age, sincerity, celebrity and love, piling irony on irony. And it features a remarkably natural performance by Kristen Stewart that's so unastounding it's astounding.</Review>
            <Review>Binoche, on whom the camera affectionately lingers, makes herself achingly vulnerable. Though the film feels at times a bit cloudy and enigmatic, it's often fascinating in its juxtapositions.</Review>
            <Review>Brilliant performances aside, "Clouds of Sils Maria" is overlong and much too self-indulgently an "art film." It might have benefited from being just a bit more grounded.</Review>
            <Review>Clouds of Sils Maria is fiendishly wise to the ways of show business, particularly the boxes in which it places women. But the film offers more than that.</Review>
            <Review>The real star turns out to be the play itself: the early masterpiece of a now-deceased writer, a work of such mirrorlike perfection that it reveals entirely different things to different people.</Review>
            <Review>It's winding, and it sure takes time and patience, and it's not all that clearly marked. But by the end, you're left with quite a view.</Review>
            <Review>The film is a puzzle, but one you don't necessarily have to solve in order to enjoy it or take something away from it.</Review>
            <Review>Less a narrative than a character study, it's a sometimes-frustrating but nonetheless curious, enthralling experience seeing the very low-key American Stewart do battle with Binoche's elegant, European diva.</Review>
            <Review>Clouds of Sils Maria shows how it is not the movies that change, but how perception of art itself changes.</Review>
            <Review>Olivier Assayas wrote this drama about a veteran actress facing a transition in her career after Juliette Binoche, arguably France's greatest and certainly most ambitious actress working today, challenged him to write a film centered on women.</Review>
            <Review>The result repays repeat viewing, and deserves to be considered in the same frame as Day for Night and 8 1/2.</Review>
            <Review>Lok, are we comfortable yet saying that Kristen Stewart has the potential to be one of the best actresses of her generation? Because she may well become one of the best actresses of her generation. And Bincohe still ain't a slouch, either.</Review>

            <Review>It Follows represents a compelling evolution in how studios and audiences can (and should) conceive of its monsters.</Review>
            <Review>No question that the storytelling here is impressive; the story itself, however, is a bit thin.</Review>
            <Review>It's a testament to how scary a movie It Follows is that for days after watching it, you walk around thinking up survival plans - should you hide, stay on the move forever, pass the haunting on to someone else?</Review>
            <Review>It's a wildly fun conceit ... Mitchell's atmospheric rendering of It Follows gives the film a fanciful, otherworldly feel.</Review>
            <Review>Good horror films rely on suspense and tension, and this one has both elements aplenty.</Review>
            <Review>"It Follows" is the creepiest movie in years.</Review>
            <Review>This impressive throwback to 80s slasher flicks is packing houses for good reason.</Review>
            <Review>It's a brilliant concept, tapping the same primitive fears -- body horror, burgeoning sexuality -- that underpinned the slasher genre, while reining in the wanton misogyny.</Review>
            <Review>Last year's brilliant The Babadook set a new bar for horror movies this decade and yet, six months later, that mark has been reached by It Follows.</Review>
            <Review>A tonic to the spate of "found footage" and shaky-cam horror films... this is a carefully designed film that recalls the visual control of John Carpenter's early horror films, especially the way it tracks movement within carefully composed shots.</Review>
            <Review>This is a ghost film whose strength is in the overwhelming air of melancholy. Nothing is scarier, or sadder, than when you have to look back over your shoulder all your life.</Review>
            <Review>You will leave the cinema looking over your shoulder - and if you see a girl in a yellow dress, just run.</Review>

            <Review>A fine, educational piece of documentary here, and the most beautiful images you'll see all season-with zero computer enhancement.</Review>
            <Review>Disheartening and uncomfortable at times, The Salt of the Earth forces its audience to confront images of a brutal, sometimes forgotten past, deconstructing any notion of an idealized, romantic history.</Review>
            <Review>Wim Wenders came graceful once again achieving a splendid film. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>A film that deconstructs the vision of an artist shocked by the horrors of humanity and yet finds beauty in all of it. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>The Salt Of The Earth is a fairly conventional biography made somewhat more intimate by a wealth of stills and home-movie footage. But that formal simplicity is merely a way of ensuring its points land clearly and without interference.</Review>
            <Review>Salt of the Earth is a self-serving and very family-sanctioned project, though not quite a chore to watch.</Review>

            <Review>Despite Ava's revealing circuitry, it is the notable sort of science fiction film that is far more reliant on ideas than effects.</Review>
            <Review>A film with enough attributes to be a reference in the genre and also one that legitimizes its debuting director in his craft. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>

            <Review>This is one of those movies that is as dull as it is well-meaning and man, is it ever well-meaning.</Review>
            <Review>The preaching is earnest and the intentions are good, but the corn is high and the presentation is amateurish.</Review>
            <Review>"Freedom" takes a compelling chapter in American history - the flight of slaves from Southern bondage to Canada via the Underground Railroad - and flattens its drama.</Review>
            <Review>The film leaves us with the impression that slaves' survival had more to do with sheer luck than dogged resilience.</Review>
            <Review>The film tries to have the scope of "12 Years a Slave." But it's ruined by the sanctimonious songs that turn the drama into a half-baked musical. Much worse: the filmmakers' need to show that not all whites employed in the slave trade were evil.</Review>
            <Review>A schmaltzy, deeply sentimentalized drama about American slavery and the rise of the Underground Railroad.</Review>
            <Review>Peter Cousens' mawkish Freedom is an apologia for the white Christian people who helped slaves escape, or at least wrote songs to make them feel better.</Review>
            <Review>Religious historical film has disturbing, graphic violence.</Review>
            <Review>Though Gooding tries hard to look sincere and troubled, often he appears slightly embarrassed. It's no surprise. Too bad so much talent is wasted here.</Review>
            <Review>Ambitious period piece without the budget or the script to cover as much of the Abolition Movement as it tries to fit in.</Review>
            <Review>Noble in intention, this story of slavery and the origin of John Newton's hymn Amazing Grace opens with style but then steadily sinks into messy theatricality, overwhelmed by its own earnestness.</Review>
            <Review>Performances are fine, and the film is well made, but it's too much of a hybrid to be successful.</Review>

            <Review>The scary part about 112 Weddings is not even the divorced couples, but the still-married, happy but stressed ones talking honestly.</Review>
            <Review>A skilled documentarian, Block moves briskly from easily relatable domestic scenarios to more tragic ones, and changes things up by focusing on two young marrieds-to-be.</Review>
            <Review>Though everything about the pic is slight and bittersweet, it's still charming.</Review>
            <Review>Deftly rips the veil off a day that mainstream culture still sappily proclaims is about 'soulmates' ... when we all know it's about one managed moment, full of statement and purpose and signifying an awful lot, in a life we can't possibly plan for.</Review>
            <Review>What the film doesn't say about marriage is more interesting than what it does.</Review>
            <Review>The film's sometimes downbeat tone can't help but evoke memories of Philip Larkin's The Whitsun Weddings.</Review>
            <Review>112 Weddings is a bittersweet portrait of the state of modern marriage, as interpreted by a New York wedding photographer.</Review>
            <Review>A startling and welcome breath of reality for an institution overladen by fantasy in our culture. Happily ever after is hard!</Review>
            <Review>This revealing documentary attempts to put marriage under a microscope by catching up with couples several years after they exchanged vows.</Review>
            <Review>Why some marriages work and some fail is still a mystery and the film is inevitably bitty and random but it is still a touching, sweet-natured slice of life.</Review>
            <Review>Disappointingly, the obvious question of Block's own marital/domestic situation is avoided. It's an entertaining study, though.</Review>
            <Review>With the gulf between audience and film subjects reduced by thoughtful honesty, our investment in the fates of each couple and individual skyrockets.</Review>

            <Review>The Longest Ride is a weak sauce addition to the Sparks empire, a little better than last year's The Best of Me, but miles below uber-Sparks work The Notebook.</Review>
            <Review>The Longest Ride is pretty darn tolerable - and sometimes even enjoyable - not just for fans but also for regular people who are, you know, cynical.</Review>
            <Review>The Longest Ride has as much bull as the 10 previous Sparks adaptations. This is one of the few you can ride for longer than eight seconds.</Review>
            <Review>As a romance, a drama, or even a sports movie, The Longest Ride never reaches a satisfying destination.</Review>
            <Review>Look, it's easy to laugh at this stuff - that's part of the game, in fact. To buy into these movies, you have to buy into the silliness. But The Longest Ride, for all its ridiculousness, comes by its emotions honestly.</Review>
            <Review>You heard of "Star Wars"? Films based on Sparks' books could be called "Star-Crossed Wars."</Review>
            <Review>Scott Eastwood's less mysterious than dad. Clint's got more warrior, Scott's got more lover. Nevertheless! Scott's very Clinty! 'Ride's' the anti-'Fifty Shades of Grey.'</Review>
            <Review>[It] so casually meanders down a cluttered road of clichés that you feel chided for daring to take a single ounce of it seriously.</Review>
            <Review>This could have been the second-best Nicholas Sparks movie had it just been Ira and Ruth's story. Instead, The Longest Ride is weighed down by an unnecessary second story that tries too hard, and bullpen full of clichés.</Review>
            <Review>Its theme of cherishing love when it comes your way couldn't be blunter, but on the whole this is one of the better Sparks movies, with even a neat twist in the tale to reward those who last the distance.</Review>
            <Review>Unfortunately, Chaplin's brilliance, Alda's funny crustiness, and Eastwood's vulnerability aren't enough to keep this film afloat.</Review>
            <Review>The Longest Ride is what happens when a studio exec sees The Notebook and Dear John, and then goes "You see that? Do it again the same, but different."</Review>

            <Review>A reminder of what this reluctant punk band that perfected a reggae-spiced pop-rock sound achieved, and the strength of the music they made.</Review>
            <Review>The scope of Andy Grieve and Lauren Lazin's film is extremely limited.</Review>
            <Review>This is a needlessly dull movie that should have gone back to the drawing board.</Review>
            <Review>Summers' big-screen take on those ongoing group tensions surrounding Sting's reluctance to be considered a career team player constantly strikes a by now all-too-familiar, predominantly sour, chord.</Review>
            <Review>A movie singularly lacking in rock-doc unpredictability and verve.</Review>

            <Review>This isn't the definitive Police documentary many will want it to be. Nor is it especially moving as a musical document.</Review>
            <Review>This documentary, narrated by Summers through passages from his 2006 memoir One Train Later, provides a unique exploration of the trio's history.</Review>
            <Review>An insightful peek into how the intersection of ambition, creativity, and ego can yield both brilliance and heartache.</Review>

        <Duration>100</Duration>
        <StoryLine>A hapless outlaw discovers he isn't any better off on the right side of the law in this offbeat western comedy set at the turn of the century. While Bickford Waner (Dennis Hopper) is known to lawmen as notorious bandit Kid Blue, his reputation far outstrips his actual success as a crook, and after a train robbery falls apart moments after it began, Bick decides it's time to go straight. Bick settles in Dime Box, Texas, a shabby little town dominated by a ceramics factory that makes novelty ashtrays, and manages to find a lose a series of odd jobs through his innate clumsiness and his short temper. Bick moves into a rooming house where he's befriended by Reese Ford (Warren Oates), a good natured man fascinated with the ancient Greeks and their ideals of male friendship, and his wife Molly (Lee Purcell), who doesn't believe their relationship need be platonic. Bick also finds a friend in pill-popping Preacher Bob (Peter Boyle) and makes an especially fierce enemy in foul-tempered sheriff "Mean John" Simpson (Ben Johnson). After his personal and professional lives take unexpected turns for the worse, Bick decides he needs to go back to a life of crime, though he hasn't gotten much better at armed robbery than he was before. Also starring Janice Rule, Ralph Waite and Clifton James, Kid Blue was shot in 1971, but not released until 1973, after the box-office failure of Dennis Hopper's The Last Movie sent his career into a tailspin; it would be his last role in an American feature until 1979's Apocalypse Now. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>Whether or not it succeeds will depend on how individual viewers weigh the movie's narrative flaws against the profound appeal of its stars and setting. For my part, it was a reminder that sometimes second best is good enough.</Review>
            <Review>Chances are, if you liked The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, you'll like the second best one as well.</Review>
            <Review>There's a sweetness to the proceedings that never quite overpowers the melancholy of maturity, and a sympathy for human frailty that stops just short of suggesting that anything goes once everything starts to go.</Review>

            <Review>That's the wonderful thing about great actors -- they can turn gush into gold.</Review>
            <Review>This is helped greatly by the easy charm of the prestige stars, many of whom are old mates and settle into variations on their sweetly standard shtick, with Smith, of course, making every knacker's-yard one-liner zing.</Review>
            <Review>Director John Madden smartly gives the Dames a couple of scenes together and keeps the whole enterprise light.</Review>
            <Review>'The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel' is indeed second-best. The element of surprise is long gone, the love's gone a bit stale, and Sonny talks too much. But he dances well!</Review>

            <Review>The movie's tone never quite evens out, but there are still sweet minor-key moments, and some good lines in all that.</Review>
            <Review>A charming supporting cast fails to invigorate "Goodbye to All That," a relentlessly flat seriocomic take on contemporary relationships marking the directorial debut of "Junebug" scribe Angus MacLachlan.</Review>
            <Review>The film's tone remains playful -- there are even some broad, laugh-out-loud moments involving a sex toy -- but poignant little moments sneak in, hinting at darker, more troubling themes.</Review>
            <Review>Otto Wall, the protagonist of Goodbye to All That, is well-meaning, clumsy and a little dull. The movie embodies his character perfectly.</Review>
            <Review>Despite its flaws, the first feature from "Junebug" writer Angus MacLachlan is a heartfelt, bittersweet and often amusing portrait of early middle-age.</Review>
            <Review>There's a lot of good awkward fun to be had as the viewer simultaneously laughs at Otto's expense and hopefully commiserates a bit with him.</Review>
            <Review>It's frustrating when Goodbye to All That runs up against the guardrail, but I'm glad to report it never derails.</Review>
            <Review>Although its premise feels artificial, there's plenty of genuine poignancy beneath the surface of this bittersweet low-budget comedy.</Review>
            <Review>More amusing than funny, and while it's disjointed, it's sincere.</Review>
            <Review>Goodbye to All That explores divorce in a low-key manner, but it lacks an emotional punch or clear sense of humor to carry it much beyond its repetitive series of sexual trysts.</Review>
            <Review>MacLachlan's screenplay ultimately turns out to be as befuddled and as directionless as its protagonist.</Review>
            <Review>Goodbye To All That is mostly just a series of vignettes, detailing Otto's sexual misadventures. And even those don't amount to much.</Review>

        <Title>24 Days</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2015</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>110</Duration>
        <StoryLine>In January of 2006 a beautiful young woman walks into a Parisian cellphone shop, looks around, and asks for the sales attendant's number. Later, she calls asking to meet. Who could have known Ilan, the 23 year old man, was flirting with death? The next time his family hears from him is through a cryptic online message from kidnappers demanding ransom. French director Alexandre Arcady delivers one of the most "wrenching and politically astute" films to come out of France (Screen Daily). Based on a book co-written by Ilan's mother, Ruth Halimi, Arcady's cinematic adaptation offers a searing insight into his vicious ordeal, the violent world of the gang of Barbarians, and the harrowing experience of his family waiting and hoping the Police would save their son. For 24 days the Police, insistent upon handling the case as a normal for-ransom kidnapping, fail to recognize the anti-Semitic hatred of his abductors. Many opportunities to save Ilan are missed or squandered as his family receive nearly 700 phone calls, insults, threats, photographs and sound recordings of their tortured son.(C) Menemsha</StoryLine>

            <Review>[It] has a more upsetting dimension than most suspense dramas as it's based on a true story, a story that touches on issues still roiling France today.</Review>
            <Review>Knowing the outcome behind the true-life tragedy "24 Days" doesn't diffuse the horror, the tension or the sadness of watching one family's drama unfold day after agonizing day when a son is kidnapped and hope dies.</Review>
            <Review>24 Days takes strength from real-world specifics. But the most powerful thing about the movie is its rejection of omniscience. The crime it reconstructs is beyond understanding.</Review>
            <Review>Sadly, "24 Days" isn't nearly as involving as it should be.</Review>
            <Review>As a suspenseful true crime story, "24 Days" succeeds. As a warning against the ever present dangers of anti-Semitism, it is eloquent and disturbing. It's in combining the two that Arcady mishandles the case.</Review>
            <Review>24 Days is neither subtle nor particularly sophisticated as filmmaking, but its refusal to reduce lived reality to generic tropes is admirable.</Review>
            <Review>As tensely suspenseful as it is shocking.</Review>
            <Review>Suspenseful with moving performances, but suffers from a pedestrian, Hollywood-style screenplay and brisk pacing that doesn't give the film enough room to breathe nor does it trust your patience.</Review>
            <Review>...a powerful family drama that has marked political and social overtones.</Review>
            <Review>A real-life "Taken." Tremendously gripping Paris police procedural.</Review>
            <Review>Told from Ruth's POV, the movie is nonetheless a tense police procedural as we keep company with the Halimi family undergoing confusion, fear, rage, hope and ultimately grief.</Review>
            <Review>A suspenseful and compelling film that's all the more powerful because it doesn't shy away from contemporary anti-Semitism in France.</Review>

            <Review>he Road Within backfires by emphasizing the same quirks and imbalances it seeks to soften. Reducing it to the genre of idiot comedy doesn't advance the cause, either.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>'71 makes so much effort to be suspenseful that it doesn't have much time to get into nuance.</Review>
            <Review>The film doesn't take sides, but shows how conflict stirs the pot of human emotions and how quickly things can get out of control. And it shows that in war, no one is right.</Review>
            <Review>Demange's feature debut miraculously distills the often Byzantine nature of the power politics behind The Troubles in a deeply intimate chamber piece about a single day in the life of a British soldier.</Review>
            <Review>People died, but it's more than the bombs, bullets and bodies. The more fascinating damage was done to psyches and souls, and Demange, with '71, comes for yours.</Review>
            <Review>The movie excites, but intelligently, without stoking blood lust or Old Testament revenge impulses.</Review>
            <Review>If you are in the mood for a confusing and thoroughly depressing immersion into Irish history, you can't do better. But that would be a very odd mood to be in.</Review>
            <Review>Demange crafts a tight, tense, white-knuckle night of the soul. He certainly proves he can stage a riot.</Review>
            <Review>An impressive debut feature buoyed by a captivating central turn.</Review>
            <Review>He's a passive hero, mostly getting buffeted along by events and people beyond his control. But '71 is no less of a deadly game of cat and mouse for that, focusing more on the other players in this very bad night.</Review>
            <Review>It's O'Connell's film and he's very fine indeed, even making you forgive the occasional (and expected) lapses into 'shaky cam'.</Review>
            <Review>'71 doesn't pretend that better times are near (Bloody Sunday is just a year ahead), though it does finally proffer a few shreds of humanity against a future we know will be terribly bleak.</Review>
            <Review>Somewhere on the continuum between "spells absolutely everything out" and "bordering on incomprehensible" -- nearer to the latter than to the former -- is this "come on, throw us a bone" narrative.</Review>

            <Review>The laziness of the effort is remarkable to watch at times, even when its cast works diligently to put on a big show, making "Walking on Sunshine" amiable but frequently insufferable.</Review>
            <Review>Sexy, not smutty, and resisting the temptation to be anything other than a family-friendly romp, Walking on Sunshine is such a feelgood pre-holiday tonic it should be available on the NHS.</Review>

            <Review>Most of Maggie is so dark you can barely make out the zombies or the humans. It also moves more slowly than the ghouls.</Review>
            <Review>I feel some guilt in giving a film that tries this hard a negative review. But I couldn't shake my sense of aggravation at how it all plays out, especially in Schwarzenegger's case.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately, neither the brain-eating genre or the heart-breaking one is enhanced by this mash-up. Like Celine Dion's cover of AC/DC's You Shook Me All Night Long, file it under the category of "interesting-but-why?"</Review>
            <Review>The problem, aside from not much going on, is that Schwarzenegger remains a severely limited actor, so there's not that much character to study. Potentially interesting concept; wrong star.</Review>
            <Review>Its creepy atmosphere aside, "Maggie" is a slog of the living dead.</Review>
            <Review>It's a sad story, or would be if the zombie apocalypse backdrop - and the inky splotches creeping across Maggie's body - didn't wreak such havoc with the movie's unsmiling sincerity.</Review>
            <Review>Maggie is beautifully shot. Hobson and director of photography Lukas Ettlin make excellent use of natural lighting to create a mood of disaster and despair.</Review>
            <Review>It's a serious, heartfelt, dramatic turn, and he totally nails it. I'm as surprised as you are.</Review>
            <Review>Maggie's power lies with its characters and the moving performances from its two leads; it's a fresh new angle at a genre that is proving to be timeless.</Review>
            <Review>I didn't enjoy it, but I did admire the acting and the emotional power of the story. It is well-crafted, but it is not entertaining.</Review>
            <Review>In his best performance of the post-Governator era, Arnold Schwarzenegger stars ... in a film that eschews traditional zombie movie expectations in favour of a more character-driven drama.</Review>
            <Review>Maggie is low on the gory action and surprisingly thoughtful. Bleak, measured, melancholic and subtle this is a story about what makes us human, not about soul-less flesh-eating monsters that go bump in the night.</Review>

            <Review>A couple of pros, playing attractive characters in an amiable yet topical story.</Review>
            <Review>Sometimes you see a play and you can imagine it being a movie. Sometimes you see a small movie like this, and you can imagine it working better as an intimate stage play.</Review>
            <Review>What begins as a sweetly sentimental story ends up being cloyingly melodramatic.</Review>
            <Review>What a pleasure to see a simple, finely tuned dramedy about real adults with real emotions in a real-life situation.</Review>

            <Review>Boy does Keaton look great in a New York apartment. Just the sight of her standing in a tiny living room is a statement against suburban life.</Review>
            <Review>While the plot might be the flimsiest, the characterisation actors Morgan Freeman and Diane Keaton bring to this film turns it into a small delight.</Review>
            <Review>Completely reliant on the warmth and goodwill generated by its stars (rather than, say, its writing), this AARP-oriented dramedy strikes all the familiar chords.</Review>
            <Review>It's all very cosy and undemanding, but Keaton and Freeman are such amiably engaging screen presences you will probably enjoy spending the time in their company.</Review>
            <Review>As storytelling, 5 Flights Up is remarkably clumsy: the narrative strands never knit together, the well-intentioned messages are awkwardly spelt out, and the stakes remain low. That said, it's an easy film to watch.</Review>
            <Review>It is hard to extract much of a high old time from a production like 5 Flights Up when the stakes involved are so exceedingly low.</Review>

            <Review>Slow West crescendos into a bravura shootout between all the involved parties, and it's as gorgeous, nihilistic, and brutally sad as the rest of the film.</Review>
            <Review>Essentially an old-school Western with some interesting tweaks, Slow West -- the debut feature from musician-turned-filmmaker John Maclean -- is a simple story told, yes, slowly. But it offers a bang-up finish.</Review>
            <Review>There's more to the story than meets the bull's eye in Slow West, a brainy and genre-defying western by newcomer John Maclean.</Review>
            <Review>It's all of 84 minutes. But when it's done, you know you've seen something.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director John Maclean insists at every opportunity that the American west teemed with brutality and that every positive myth about the region was built on a lie, yet he doesn't deliver this familiar revisionist history with much force.</Review>
            <Review>Maclean's film is a wonderfully dreamy, if meandering, take on the western. Like all movies that use their fantastic surroundings, Slow West is best seen on a big screen.</Review>
            <Review>The tone of the film, a darkly absurdist frontier odyssey, recalls both the films of the Coen Brother and the novels of Cormac McCarthy.</Review>
            <Review>This is an often ferociously entertaining and substantial debut.</Review>
            <Review>Slow West derives its strength not only from its multi-layered story but also from its spectacular visuals of a geography, which simultaneously seems subliminally awe-inspiring and menacing.</Review>
            <Review>This quirky, confident Western belies the fact it is the director's first feature, and marks him out as one to watch.</Review>
            <Review>It may skimp on its characters, but with a mostly successful amalgamation of various tones, Slow West is a beautiful and bold shot in the arm for the genre.</Review>
            <Review>Slow West utilises a massive arsenal of cinematic techniques shunned by most commercial filmmakers, and shows that an arthouse film can hold both tension and big ideas at once.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Jewish culture reflects the heart of a vital ethnic history. As that culture continues to shift and adapt alongside mainstream America, delicatessen food - as its name suggests - remains a beloved communal delicacy.In Houston, Texas, third-generation deli man Ziggy Gruber has built arguably the finest delicatessen restaurant in the U.S. His story - augmented by the stories of iconic delis such as Katz's, 2nd Avenue Deli, Nate 'n Al, Carnegie, and the Stage - embodies a tradition indelibly linked to its savory, nostalgic foods.

            <Review>Anjou is not chintzy with the upbeat schmaltz - again with the bouncy klezmer music! - but his chatty story on the decline of the urban eatery's ubiquity is not just about chopped liver, but the loss of Jewish culture.</Review>
            <Review>Heartfelt and heartwarming, Deli Man is documentary filmmaking at its tastiest.</Review>
            <Review>Gruber's sense of a calling to tradition is a common denominator among the many deli owners we meet in this fun and interesting film, mostly stressed-out men who somehow find deep satisfaction in being part of a long history.</Review>
            <Review>Like a fat slab of pastrami, "Deli Man" is the cinematic equivalent of comfort food: warm, generous and made with love.</Review>
            <Review>The audience gets a crash course in kreplach, pastrami and matzo-ball soup. Nothing fancy here - no tarragon top notes, says one of the interviewees - but big portions and good company.</Review>
            <Review>Deli Man makes for a pleasant investigation of the legacy and mythology of Jewish food culture.</Review>
            <Review>A delightful and informative documentary on delis, Jewish food, and the tricks of the trade.</Review>
            <Review>Best of all, it's a character portrait of of deli owner David "Ziggy" Gruber -- almost a biopic, that charts not only his work, but his personal life.</Review>
            <Review>A delectable, artery-clogging delight...</Review>
            <Review>At once a celebration and a quasi-historical analysis, it may try to stuff too much into a ninety-minute span, but...it's pretty darned tasty.</Review>
            <Review>The history and heartbeat of delicatessens is a strange subject for a documentary, but "Deli Man" turns out to be a charismatic and informative journey into Jewish and foodie culture.</Review>

            <Review>Sometimes you know a movie is going to work in about the first three scenes. This one really works.</Review>
            <Review>Despite a debatable focus and dubious moralizing -money plays a pivotal role in the final outcome - "The Woman in Gold" works, largely because of the odd-couple chemistry between Mirren and Reynolds.</Review>
            <Review>Director Simon Curtis is lucky to have Helen Mirren on hand, since she can turn the film's art history speeches into something that sounds like conversation. But the screenplay doesn't do either of them any favors.</Review>
            <Review>Director Simon Curtis milks the predictable drama, thrills and heartache of the Holocaust-era story, but it's a paint-by-numbers triumph, a copy of something we've seen many times before.</Review>
            <Review>"Woman in Gold" may be a bit obvious, but it's still a story worth telling.</Review>
            <Review>Next to Mirren, [Reynolds is] like a dope in a museum, trying to be respectful of the genius around him but unable to sit still.</Review>
            <Review>Mirren and Reynolds play off each other nicely.</Review>
            <Review>With Gold, Curtis does justice to a fascinating story with far-reaching political and cultural implications. He helms with a sensitive hand, while maintaining a healthy pace.</Review>
            <Review>A handsome production design and some heartfelt performances in minor roles deliver incidental pleasures but the film as a whole feels like a wasted opportunity.</Review>
            <Review>What Woman In Gold does have going for it is a strong performance from the always on point Mirren and a fascinating true story.</Review>
            <Review>A minor entry into the canon of Harvey Weinstein auteur theory, a film that has particularly strong moments undercut by uneven character development as the story loses focus.</Review>
            <Review>Mirren and Reynolds make for an entertaining central pairing.</Review>

            <Review>A movie about manufactured consensus would be a vital public service. But "Merchants of Doubt" isn't quite that movie.</Review>
            <Review>Aside from an eye-opening investigation of useless and harmful flame repellents pumped into furniture, it sticks to climate change without broadening its scope to other examples of corporate spinning, which must be plentiful.</Review>
            <Review>A compelling exposé of professional propagandists, though the movie itself is not agenda-free.</Review>
            <Review>You leave "Merchants of Doubt," as you do any good muckraking documentary, both fascinated and enraged ...</Review>
            <Review>Merchants of Doubt shouldn't be a hard sell. The fact that it is should make you very mad.</Review>
            <Review>Subtle, it's not. But it is effective.</Review>
            <Review>Using a magician's tricks as a metaphor for corporate tactics is clever, and Kenner's found an eloquent talking head in history of science prof Naomi Oreskes, but as in his previous flick, Food, Inc., he keeps hammering away at the same idea.</Review>
            <Review>Based on the 2010 book by Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway, the film lays out a convincing, follow-the-money trail from the tobacco industry's postwar efforts to prevent (or forestall) government regulation to a profitable lobbying specialty today.</Review>
            <Review>Kenner's sympathies are clear - "Don't let them stack the deck!" the film proclaims - and ultimately Merchants of Doubt does a much better job of making you think than convincing you of what to think.</Review>
            <Review>As a political propaganda film about the dangers of political propaganda, it's difficult to imagine Merchants of Doubt having any effect beyond the cold comfort it might bring the choir.</Review>
            <Review>Director Robert Kenner delivers this rote but stirring documentary about the fake experts and pseudo-scientists that are employed by corporations to spread doubt in the media about scientific facts.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is at its best when profiling the titular merchants.</Review>

            <Review>Pegg's a pleasure, but elsewhere "Kill Me Three Times" is never as clever as it wants to be.</Review>
            <Review>It has fun with convention through effective pacing and character trajectories that often don't stay where cliché and preconception guess.</Review>

            <Review>The movie's quirky setting pays off dividends where you least expect them. At such moments, the movie's humanism finally seems unforced, and everything is the better for that.</Review>
            <Review>Chris Messina's "Alex of Venice" is as much a love letter to the Los Angeles neighborhood as it is a well-observed drama.</Review>
            <Review>An appealing portrait miniature of a woman who loses and finds her bearings ...</Review>
            <Review>The film is so uneven, the characters and relationships so undeveloped, it's hard to work up much sympathy.</Review>
            <Review>As she flails through a few dubious choices, the character may be on the kind of self-discovery path we've seen in countless other films; but Winstead makes the outcome seem far from preordained.</Review>
            <Review>Although it's enjoyable, actor Chris Messina's directorial debut is somehow less than the sum of its parts, wading only through the shallow end of familiar human conflicts resolved too conveniently to satisfy.</Review>
            <Review>Alex of Venice might not break any new bounds in storytelling but it's a confident exploration of a traumatic life change.</Review>
            <Review>Alex Of Venice closes with a bit of a whimper, though it's a pleasant ride, nevertheless.</Review>
            <Review>Passable at best, but doesn't quite have enough charm or humour to flavour the storytelling tofu.</Review>
            <Review>The problem with Chris Messina's directorial debut isn't so much badness as it is superfluousness -- that it is less its own discrete thing than a redundant genre study in This Type of Movie.</Review>
            <Review>Chris Messina's directorial debut is a strong one, mainly because of a beautifully wounded leading performance by Marty Elizabeth Winstead that's full of strength, growth, and heartwarming soul.</Review>
            <Review>Sweet, earnest, perfectly-crafted first feature from actor Chris Messina about an LA family in transition. The delicate plot is graced with wonderful performances in all major and minor roles. Low-key and luminous.</Review>

            <Review>It's a letdown ... that the final act turns to a melodramatic showdown ...</Review>
            <Review>At a mere 71 minutes, this naturalistic snapshot set at a bucolic residence for pregnant girls feels like it needed more gestation before cameras rolled.</Review>
            <Review>"Uncertain Terms" finds some substance within its ideology of evaporated ambitions, though there's plenty of empty space in which the film is still able to limit itself.</Review>
            <Review>Pivoting off pop music cues, "Uncertain Terms" can feel slight, and, oddly for this filmmaker, it dips into clichéd dialogue.</Review>
            <Review>The film is brisk, brief, well acted, smartly crafted, and shrewdly judged.</Review>
            <Review>A rural group home for pregnant teen-agers is the setting for this intimately detailed, sharply observed modernist melodrama, directed by Nathan Silver.</Review>
            <Review>Kudos to Silver for taking big risks, and for the most part making them work.</Review>
            <Review>Partnered with a naturalistic style that takes every advantage of its verdant backdrop, Uncertain Terms is a near-perfect ode to summer and its ephemeral pleasures.</Review>
            <Review>The story doesn't develop as much as deepen, which might frustrate people looking for a simpler, less intuitive drama, but it worked just fine for me.</Review>
            <Review>Appropriately, the images in the film, the most fluidly beautiful and resonant of Nathan Silver's career thus far, suggest flashes of memory relived from the vantage point of the future.</Review>
            <Review>The underage-mother angle supplies Uncertain Terms with a much-needed dash of flavor, but the end product still comes out as relatively thin gruel.</Review>
            <Review>Heartbreaking, funny and truthful, with more depth crammed into 75 minutes than most manage in two hours.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Only a few weeks after Annie Barlow exterminated the plague that was the Judas Killer, we meet June Abbott, a woman whose carefully constructed life in Los Angeles is beginning to unravel due to lucid nightmares so awful they disturb her waking life. When Special Agent Terrence Ballard, the FBI agent assigned to wrap up the case of the newly deceased Judas Killer, shows up at June's door, he brings with him some terrifying news - there is a Judas copycat killer on the loose in her neighborhood! In the course of his investigation, Ballard shows June a picture of the copycat killer's victim, and she is stunned to see that it's the same woman she saw brutally murdered in her nightmares. A series of hauntings begin to torment June, growing in frequency and ferocity over time. Now, not only does she see murder victims, but her dreams put herself in the role of the murderer. June fears that the spirit of the Judas Killer is the architect of some greater plan in which she must now play a part. June struggles to maintain her grip on sanity as she plunges into her own investigation of these events. No matter the result, the truth will be horrifying; either there is true evil inside of her, or someone, or something, is determined to destroy her...(C) IFC Midnight</StoryLine>

            <Review>The story's a wash ... with a twist that won't surprise, and Patrick Fischler's role as the creepy FBI agent is too obvious a puzzle piece.</Review>
            <Review>The directors, Dallas Hallam and Patrick Horvath, are fluent in the genre's staples ... And they draw decent work from their actors, who commit to the wispy, subtext-free material.</Review>
            <Review>For all their skill with shambling corpses sneaking up behind beautiful women, the filmmakers can't figure out where to put the camera in those moments when characters are simply talking to each other.</Review>
            <Review>"The Pact 2" simply stretches out rather than elaborating on its predecessor's already thin premise, creating holes that are poorly patched over with false scares and unconvincing character behavior.</Review>
            <Review>An entirely underwhelming horror sequel...</Review>
            <Review>rather like a modern giallo with its twisty whodunnit plotting and irrational elements, but likely to prove incomprehensible, at least through its first third, to anyone who's not seen Nicholas McCarthy's original and better The Pact (20121).</Review>
            <Review>It's unnecessary, and worse, glacial and uninspired, laboring to come up with a few viable reasons to plunge back into this limited world and manipulate it into a burgeoning franchise.</Review>
            <Review>There's a worthy sequel to a better-than-average horror film in here somewhere, but it's buried underneath a wild goose chase that ultimately goes nowhere.</Review>
            <Review>The Pact II plays like a more convoluted version of The Pact - and since I don't care for Nicholas McCarthy's original, I think you can guess how I feel about Hallam and Horvath's sequel.</Review>
            <Review>But while it has its (very) creepy moments, The Pact 2 lacks the original's punch.</Review>

        <StoryLine>From Paul Solet, director of the acclaimed hit Grace, comes DARK SUMMER, a suspense thriller combining the supernatural terror of classic horrors THE SHINING and POLTERGEIST, with the tension and modern cool of DISTURBIA. Summer is a time to relax, unwind, take a vacation, and be free. But 17 year old Daniel Austin gets none of that because his obsessive online stalking of his classmate and crush, Mona Wilson, got him put on house arrest for the whole summer. So, no cell phone, no Internet, no leaving the property, and especially no Mona. Then Daniel's single mother has to go on a long business trip, and Daniel has the place to himself. Daniel figures out a way to piggyback onto his neighbors' wireless signal and believing he's surfing off the grid, uses his time to check in on his friends - and Mona... But what Daniel didn't expect is for Mona to check up on him. And what she does next shakes him to his very core. And then things start to happen. Daniel receives mysterious packages in the mail, hears phantom noises, sees inanimate objects move, and feels a strange presence in the house... (C) IFC</StoryLine>

            <Review>Offers fairly meagre chills. Still, the script has a few inventive (if not necessarily credible) moves up its sleeve.</Review>
            <Review>It's hard not to think of viewing "Dark Summer" as running-time served.</Review>
            <Review>There is something profoundly draining and suffocatingly incestuous about watching a film that's dedicated to watching a computer screen.</Review>
            <Review>As an exercise in atmosphere, this claustrophobic creeper does a lot with a little, even if the movie winds up providing just superficial shivers.</Review>
            <Review>A clumsily established premise develops into little more than a series of familiar "gotcha!" scares.</Review>
            <Review>The mumbly dialogue between the three teens - realistic though it probably is - makes it hard to care too much about Daniel's housebound fate.</Review>
            <Review>A crisp 80-minute horror movie that may take a few scenes to get rolling, but also showcases some very interesting ideas and a great lead performance.</Review>
            <Review>An intriguing, if flawed look at the nature of obsession.</Review>
            <Review>Mopes around for 82 minutes, inspiration in short supply.</Review>
            <Review>Dark Summer is worth taking a chance on.</Review>
            <Review>This is the kind of film that relies heavily on sledgehammer sound design and creepy imagery in the absence of a persuasive story.</Review>
            <Review>It is an efficiently crafted, small-scale film with an interesting premise, although it sometimes feels like an atmospheric short that has been stretched out.</Review>

            <Review>"Laugh Killer Laugh" is a tired parody that seems to have been constructed from received notions of noir and mob movies. Even the jazzy score sounds like an affectation.</Review>
            <Review>Conversations meander and fizzle; characters repeat themselves, speaking in banalities and clichés.</Review>
            <Review>Wins points for ambition, but doesn't survive Ahmed's stiff execution. It's dark but never profound, while the rest of the effort struggles to achieve consistency, leaving laughs and emotion in short supply.</Review>

            <Review>[It] sounds, as so many things do on the level of 25-words-or-less ephemera, incredible. In execution, it's a real slog.</Review>

            <Review>Alien Outpost may not necessarily be the most inventive film you'll ever see but it's a well-made indie film that feels much bigger than its budget and manages to also put a clever twist on the alien invaders that you don't see very often these days.</Review>
            <Review>There are enough pyrotechnics and human/alien fight scenes to mostly hold your attention, although the film never delivers a whole lot more than that.</Review>
            <Review>Kudos to "Alien Outpost" for attempting a lot with limited resources.</Review>
            <Review>It's a found footage war movie about soldiers vs. aliens. Basic stuff, but it's not boring.</Review>

            <Review>Though well-executed, [Alien Outpost is] ultimately overly familiar and predictable.</Review>
            <Review>The film's generic mythology, the part that doesn't cost anything, is what really could have used some punching-up.</Review>

            <Review>A delightful, sharp dramedy that skewers the topic from every angle imaginable.</Review>
            <Review>Divided into three loosely connected stories involving the same players, "Zero Motivation" is strongest in its characters and its connection to an Israeli reality we can feel even if we've never experienced it.</Review>
            <Review>The office comedy is weak. The gross-out gags are too safe. A covert lesbian crush is underused.</Review>
            <Review>There's method in the madness, but little of it elsewhere in "Zero Motivation."</Review>
            <Review>An engaging, desert-dry, feminist-minded comedy ...</Review>
            <Review>To the panoply of films that explore the banality and inanity of army life, here's a worthy addition told from a refreshing perspective: that of young women conscripts in the Israel Defence Forces.</Review>
            <Review>Tonally, Zero is constantly shifting all over the place. You can never get too comfortable with the film, but that is what makes it distinctive.</Review>
            <Review>This isn't some fluff piece of sorority drama and jokes. There are still consequences for every action and just because Zohar is the lead doesn't mean she's immune to them.</Review>
            <Review>In a way the film is radically post-feminist, with women unapologetically succumbing to instincts both natural and cultural with no regard for the codes of conduct in the male-oriented microcosm.</Review>
            <Review>A very good debut directorial and writer effort by Israeli filmmaker Talya Lavie.</Review>
            <Review>It sneaks up on you as it goes along, offering unexpected shadings and variations on the minor-key absurdism.</Review>
            <Review>Recommended. A M.A.S.H-esque combination of satire and seriousness.</Review>

        <StoryLine>New love feeds a woman's deepest fears in this independent drama. Julie (Jess Weixler) is a shy young woman who one day happens to meet a handsome and mysterious man. As the two get to know one another, Julie learns the stranger is Max Oliver (Willem Dafoe), a well-known author. Max is still struggling emotionally with the death of his wife Lucia (Mariela Franganillo), a famous dancer, but with Julie he begins to come to terms with his grief, and as he falls for her, he asks her to leave New York and come with him to his estate in Italy. Against the strong advice of her friends, Julie accepts Max's offer, but as she learns more about the new man in her life, she becomes increasingly fascinated with the story of his widow. Soon Julie has become obsessed with Lucia, and she's hobbled by jealousy and feelings of inadequacy brought on by a woman she has never met. A Woman was written and directed by Giada Colagrande, who is also the wife of leading man Willem Dafoe. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>The entrancing fifth feature of the Zellner brothers, Kumiko the Treasure Hunter, is like found art in the beguiling, haunting manner it combines the seemingly ridiculous and desperate with an ineffable and quiet sadness.</Review>
            <Review>A great film for people who are tired of associating the color black with sadness and despair: now, both of those things are available in snowy white!</Review>
            <Review>File this one under "odd and interesting but ... "</Review>
            <Review>If Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter takes its time, it's time worth taking.</Review>
            <Review>In the title role, Kikuchi is impressive, easily handling Kumiko's comic and more somber sides and never allowing us to settle into a single or simple interpretation of the character.</Review>
            <Review>If you're in the mood for something different, you're in luck: "Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter" takes elements of the traditional quest story into completely new places.</Review>
            <Review>As the film uncomfortably unfolds to an inevitable conclusion, nihilistic overtones encapsulate any emotional connection to her struggle.</Review>
            <Review>Unfortunately, Treasure opened too early in the year for short attention span Academy members, because Rinko Kikuchi seriously merits consideration for her second Oscar nom.</Review>
            <Review>Fortunately, the Zellners have better plans for their heroine in Kumiko's delirious, wonderfully improbable, and probably surrealistic, ending.</Review>
            <Review>A wonderfully accessible indie dark comic tale about movie obsessions.</Review>
            <Review>It all boils down to Kikuchi's mesmerizing performance as the wounded, desperate Kumiko. Deep down, she may know the treasure is not real, but she can't face a world in which it isn't. And that's life, pretty much.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2015</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>170</Duration>
        <StoryLine>When legendary Russian auteur Aleksei German died in 2013, he left behind this extraordinary final film, a phantasmagoric adaptation of the revered sci-fi novel by the Strugatsky brothers (authors of the source novel for Tarkovsky's STALKER). HARD TO BE A GOD began percolating in German's consciousness in the mid-1960s, and would actively consume him for the last 15 years of his life. Happily, he brought the film close enough to completion for his wife and son to apply the finishing touches immediately after his passing. Taking place on the planet Arkanar, which is in the midst of its own Middle Ages, the film focuses on Don Rumata, one of a group of earth scientists who have been sent to Arkanar with the proviso that they must not interfere in the planet's political or historical development. Treated by the planet's natives as a kind of divinity, Don Rumata is both godlike and impotent in the face of its chaos and brutality. (C) Kino Lorber</StoryLine>

            <Review>Nasty, brutish, and long.</Review>
            <Review>The late director Aleksei Guerman's last film is a grandly arbitrary carnival of neo-medieval depravity. It's also a mudpunk allegory of Russian barbarism and backwardness.</Review>
            <Review>Not only an unforgettable individual masterpiece but probably one of the capital-G Great Films.</Review>
            <Review>The roiling setting alone enforces a medieval mind-set that feels genuine: brutal yet often jovially rambunctious and crude, pre-psychological in its sense of the cheapness of life and yet rich with local custom and detail.</Review>
            <Review>It is grotesque and deranged and Hieronymus Bosch-like, and damn if it isn't a bona fide vision-but of what, exactly?</Review>
            <Review>It gets uncommonly dense narrative and thematic mileage out of things that would apparently have nothing to do with narrative or theme, like camera movement and squelchy, wet production design.</Review>
            <Review>Hard to Be a God is the perfection of the director's long-take approach, likely to remain unmatched for years to come.</Review>
            <Review>A profoundly, wilfully destabilising experience.</Review>
            <Review>We are shown that the world is a cesspool, in repetitive detail, for three hours. It's an incredible-looking and -sounding immersion, but not quite a conversation.</Review>
            <Review>Bewildering, darkly hilarious, something of an endurance test, and made with such epic scale and precision that it's also breathtaking.</Review>
            <Review>The result may be an awe-inspiring folly rather than a fully realised masterpiece, but it's radically out of the ordinary.</Review>

            <Review>A confused and contradictory mess.</Review>
            <Review>Ferrell has stuck to the formulaic farce that made him a star, even as his roles have been shifting from antic instigator to bewildered straight man.</Review>
            <Review>Dumb, juvenile comedy has its place when it's funny. Unfortunately, too often in Get Hard, it's not.</Review>
            <Review>From its juvenile double entendre title to its fascination with prison rape and homophobic humor, "Get Hard" practically announces itself as an offensive, tired and unimaginative comedy in nearly every scene.</Review>
            <Review>It trucks in stereotypes (black, white, Latino, female -- the list is long) and plays clumsily with sexuality. Still, the movie's greatest and altogether familiar sin is that it's stupid.</Review>
            <Review>Obvious, lazy, tone-deaf, and mean-spirited - and that, friends, is hard to laugh at.</Review>
            <Review>A deformed composite of every buddy comedy ever made, sliced and diced to the point of total anonymity. The characters aren't buddies and the premise isn't comedic.</Review>
            <Review>Too often the filmmakers rely on lowest-common-denominator prison rape jokes and lazy plotting to allow for action-comedy set pieces.</Review>
            <Review>Will Ferrell's steep descent into total irrelevance continues with Get Hard...</Review>
            <Review>It isn't anything revelatory, but the cast is charming enough even when dealing with asinine subject matter. There are a few big laughs to be had and it's not a wholly unenjoyable watch.</Review>
            <Review>Sure, you'll get a few laughs because you can't stop Hart and Ferrell from being funny, no matter how bad the script is. But Get Hard is an example of two very funny people coming together to make a movie that, in the end, is only mildly amusing, at best.</Review>

        <Duration>83</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Elizabeth Streb's Extreme Action Company is to American Ballet Theater as Spider-Man is to a National Geographic special on arachnids. Working out of an industrial building in Williamsburg, her troupe hones dangerous, mind-boggling feats: hybrids of dance, acrobatics, performance art, theater of cruelty, and maybe just plain cruelty. The spiky-haired Streb, outfitted in motorcycle boots and de rigeur black everything, is a surprisingly gamine woman whose charisma is as palpable as the affection and compassion she affords her dancers. Catherine Gund's exhilarating documentary records Streb's latest forays into gravity-defying actions as well as wonderful archival footage that records her early decades of work, leading up to the MacArthur "genius" grant she received in 1997. Two of many breathtaking spectacles that punctuate the movie: Streb dancers bungee-jumping off London's Millennium Bridge and dangling fearlessly from the London Eye. Streb earns her reputation as the Evel Knievel of dance.</StoryLine>

            <Review>"Born to Fly" is a special film about an artist very much dedicated to an original vision, one that articulates the relationship of human bodies to space and time, and strength and resilience towards unstoppable and unmovable forces beyond our control.</Review>
            <Review>Dance purists might dismiss Streb's work as circus gymnastics, but a bracing aesthetic is inseparable from the corporal shocks, as is an insistence on challenging accepted constraints.</Review>

            <Review>Born to Fly is a solid profile of choreographer Elizabeth Streb, but it misses the opportunity to more effectively capture the blunt physicality of her work with the tools of cinema.</Review>

            <Review>Rarely, though, have two Academy Award-winning actors been so stunningly off the mark in the same movie.</Review>
            <Review>I object to The Gunman because it's unconvincing and incoherent.</Review>
            <Review>A dull, generic retread, made far worse by Penn's self-seriousness as an actor, by the banal political pieties he's grafted on as producer and co-writer, and by the presence of a pitifully retrograde female lead role.</Review>
            <Review>I doubt The Gunman will do much to advance Penn's foray into action-hero bankability, and that's probably a good thing. He's too fine an actor to be mired in nonstop shootouts while flashing his pecs and looking scowly.</Review>
            <Review>The Gunman degenerates into dreary setups for guns and gore. Penn merits more. So do we.</Review>
            <Review>The actors are good and the action is thrilling. And if the film isn't quite as seriously political as I'm guessing Penn told himself it was, it's definitely an offbeat change of pace for us.</Review>
            <Review>Even for an action movie, The Gunman is ridiculously, almost courageously, dumb. It's also boring. So, you know, it's got that going for it.</Review>
            <Review>Relentlessly, loudly violent, the well-made Gunman is oddly compelling even when it's stupid (often).</Review>
            <Review>That aid work and violence are often two sides of the same coin is an all too familiar scenario, but in The Gunman there's little distinction between the pair.</Review>
            <Review>You just leave the theater suspecting in most alternate universes that this movie is totally awesome, but the one we get is just okay.</Review>
            <Review>It's directed by Pierre Morel, who started the geri-action genre with Liam Neeson in Taken. This one's both more complex and stupider and barely exciting, even when it's hailing bullets.</Review>
            <Review>In spite of its human rights background story and the presence of actor Sean Penn, The Gunman unspools as little more than a by-the-numbers action thriller.</Review>

            <Review>One of the things that partly excuses the movie's mush is that it's a kind of musical.</Review>
            <Review>Danny Collins is the cinematic equivalent of a well-sung easy rock tune, enjoyably light and bouncy, with some darker notes hidden within the chords.</Review>
            <Review>For his directorial debut, Fogelman puts all the right people together, and what's more, gets a performance out of Pacino that's one of his best-ever comic turns.</Review>
            <Review>Pacino's exuberance rescues Dan Fogelman's directing debut from the schematic snares in Fogelman's script.</Review>
            <Review>It's never dull to watch pros like Pacino, Bening, Plummer, Garner and Cannavale interact - this is dream casting - and the film makes the most of that, along with a pleasingly comprehensive Lennon soundtrack.</Review>
            <Review>Comedy, pathos, and some schmaltzy couplets about the changing seasons follow forthwith.</Review>
            <Review>Danny Collins is, at times, an engaging and downright hilarious comedy drama that will have you laughing through the tears but this is simply owing to the sublime performances from its cast...</Review>
            <Review>There's undeniable humanity and gentle humor running through this tale of redemption.</Review>

            <Review>This is an unrelentingly dour take on the fantasy genre, ditching the wizards, dragons and rampant nudity - aka, the fun stuff.</Review>
            <Review>This thing is so garbled and goofy it plays like a parody. Except it's not.</Review>
            <Review>"Last Knights" is so thoroughly mediocre, so dully empty, that it's difficult to summon the enthusiasm to trash it. And yet, duty calls.</Review>
            <Review>Once upon a time, filmmakers had the luxury of giving their genre movies time to breathe; you don't see much of that on a big scale any more. I loved this movie, warts and all.</Review>
            <Review>A movie this silly should be prefaced with an apology: "Um, about Last Knights ... "</Review>
            <Review>Its cast aside, "Last Knights" proves as square and blandly manly as an old "Prince Valiant" comic strip.</Review>
            <Review>There's a distinct lack of excitement and sense of adventure that underlines Japanese director Kazuaki Kiriya's medieval-fantasy, Last Knights; a slow, puzzling and dreary sword-and-sandals action that is devoid of any energy.</Review>
            <Review>[It] most specifically reminds one of those bland, abandoned fantasy films that seemed to just materialize from nowhere on video-store shelves in the late 90's.</Review>
            <Review>It's crushingly dull and an utter waste of talent.</Review>
            <Review>Serious to a fault, Last Knights is a two hour drama that hides a leaner, meaner 90 minute war machine.</Review>
            <Review>Combines elements of both the typical revenge plot thriller, and then the Game of Thrones inspired castles and brothels environment - offering absolutely nothing that we haven't seen before.</Review>
            <Review>A dreadfully boring slog that takes itself far too seriously.</Review>

            <Review>The wonderful thing about While We're Young and the relationship that develops between Josh and Cornelia and Jamie and Darby is that it's less about resentment than it is a celebration of romantic love. At least initially.</Review>
            <Review>While We're Young may provide the fusion of two disparate narrative packages but the glass is only half-full.</Review>
            <Review>Baumbach, whose films include the searingly funny, autobiographical The Squid and the Whale and the brilliantly uncomfortable Margot at the Wedding, writes wry, sharp, poignant stuff.</Review>
            <Review>Baumbach plays with universal themes about the uncertainty of aging, the elusive nature of "cool" and the acceptance that comes with settling down ...</Review>
            <Review>For a while much of this contemporary comedy is great fun - until the party ends and you're ready for these people to go home.</Review>
            <Review>While We're Young starts off as an empathetic, funny look at middle age and winds up as profound and schematic as a Neil Simon play - or, for the younger set, an episode of The New Girl.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately, this film is about two well-meaning people coming to grips with who they actually are versus who they've always thought they were supposed to be. And when it's on a roll, While We're Young is hilarious.</Review>
            <Review>Baumbach's most engaging and least condescending film.</Review>
            <Review>Generation Y pays tribute to some kind of romanticized, analog echt-ness while being profoundly, scarily (often hypocritically) in virtuoso command of all things digital.</Review>
            <Review>It's a very funny movie, and a beautifully cast one</Review>
            <Review>Some fans might wish Baumbach had made another "Frances Ha," another "Kicking And Screaming." But instead he's made his first "While We're Young." And thank God for that.</Review>
            <Review>The importance of ageing gracefully is examined with both humour and pain in the sharply observed While We're Young, a satire that's more brutally honest than it is impertinent.</Review>

        <Title>I Am Evel Knievel</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>94</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Evel Knievel's rise to superstardom was built on nerves of steel and the ability to get up and do it again no matter the severity of the fall. He lived life like every day was his last, which led to a tumultuous life filled with stunts no man would ever dream of, encompassing meteoric success, wild hubris, egomaniacal mistakes, and ultimately redemption. Sporting flashy leather jumpsuits and a determined grin in the face of death, Knievel became a national hero whose outrageous feats were broadcast on live TV. "My father was truly an awe inspiring character and an original in every sense of the word, and his legacy has grown even more amazing over the years", states Kelly Knievel, "There was a reason my dad so captured the imagination of the world. This film captures the man's character, determination, successes and failures." I AM EVEL KNIEVEL is the untold story of this legendary figure who gave birth to the culture and the meaning of the word "extreme". The film also showcases Knievel's rise from a small town rebel in Butte, Montana, to a cultural icon. The enduring legacy of Evel Knievel is his unforgettable death-defying jumps. The film - from producer-director Derik Murray (I Am Chris Farley, I Am Steve McQueen, I Am Bruce Lee), and writer-executive producer Paul Gertz (I Am Chris Farley, Johnny Cash: American Rebel) - features footage of Knievel's greatest jumps, including his first major attempt, over the fountains at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, the Snake River Canyon jump in Idaho and London's Wembley Stadium jump. A cast featuring those who knew him best and were inspired to achieve greatness of their own, including Matthew McConaughey, Kid Rock, Michelle Rodriguez, Guy Fieri, Robbie Maddison, daredevils Spanky Spangler and Mike Vallely, Willie G. Davidson of Harley-Davidson, funnyman Bob Einstein (known as Super Dave Osborne), Chris and J.C. Agajanian, and family members including sons Kelly and Robbie, and former wives Linda Knievel and Krystal Kennedy-Knievel.</StoryLine>

        <Duration>110</Duration>
        <StoryLine>The subjects of BEFORE YOU KNOW IT are no ordinary senior citizens. They are go-go booted bar-hoppers, love struck activists, troublemaking baton twirlers, late night Internet cruisers, seasoned renegades and bold adventurers. They are also among the estimated 2.4 million lesbian, gay and bisexual Americans over the age of 55 in the United States, many of whom face heightened levels of discrimination, neglect and exclusion. But BEFORE YOU KNOW IT is not a film about cold statistics and gloomy realities, it's a film about generational trailblazers who have surmounted prejudice and defied expectation to form communities of strength, renewal and camaraderie. An affirmation of life and human resilience told with humor and candor, BEFORE YOU KNOW IT confirms that you are never too old to reshape society. (c) The Film Collaborative</StoryLine>

            <Review>Conceptually pedestrian but decently handled in all departments.</Review>
            <Review>It's not enough for Pound Of Flesh to be likable. Its existence isn't an affront to the God its characters keep talking about, but it's not exactly a reason for giving thanks, either.</Review>
            <Review>That it's not terrible despite its debits is probably the most generous assessment of Jean-Claude Van Damme's latest, a watchable oddity.</Review>
            <Review>The car chase is a combination of bad f/x, a lack of speed and "close calls" &amp; "collisions" that make it the saddest thing I've seen since all of Dear Zachary.</Review>
            <Review>The feature wants to be a massive action event, but it doesn't have the resources and the simplicity to snowball through 100 minutes of excitement, wasting a perfectly good revenge plot on tedious domestic woes.</Review>
            <Review>There's no reason to ever watch Pound of Flesh unless you're some kind of Van Damme completist.</Review>
            <Review>Extremely low-rent actioner that's only for die hard JCVD fans. Even Van Damme seems bored, opting to keep his sunglasses on for almost the whole movie.</Review>
            <Review>The script endlessly delays the film's grungy setpieces with scenes of moral turgidity</Review>
            <Review>Old School Van Damme -- who can still do the stunts, and still winds up in movies where the stunts are all you notice.</Review>
            <Review>Heavy Van Dammage!</Review>
            <Review>There's half a really amazing action flick here. However, you can't help but wish that it had gone full-tilt in its lunacy, rather than just partway.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>For a film that makes you sick with dread, Timbuktu has a light, at times glancing touch.</Review>
            <Review>Director Abderrahmane Sissako, a Muslim from neighboring Mauritania, has made a movie that is worthy of comparisons on several levels to Terrence Malick's wheat-field tragedy "Days of Heaven."</Review>
            <Review>The performances are hushed and memorable. Cinematographer Sofian El Fanicaptures the beauty of this desert land. Amine Bouhafa's score is its own act of gorgeous grace and defiance.</Review>
            <Review>Even though the atrocities committed by radical jihadists dominate the headlines and airwaves, few in the West know what it's like to live under their reign. Timbuktu...is a moving, haunting and beautifully shot peek behind the closed cultural curtain.</Review>
            <Review>This is the clash of ancient and modern, of rulers and ruled, of rabid dogma and the joys of daily life. It is a portrait of the ugly folly of imposed ideology, a too-common condition for far too many.</Review>
            <Review>A transcendent political poem as intellectually rigorous as it is beautiful.</Review>
            <Review>Timbuktu is a film that should resonate for a long time to come.</Review>
            <Review>A haunting warning cry from a great North African director about the jihadi invasion of Mali, Timbuktu is a message the rest of the world can't afford to ignore.</Review>
            <Review>Abderrahmane Sissako can no longer be called one of the greatest African directors of our time; he has become, simply, one of the greatest directors of our time.</Review>
            <Review>Suffers from a certain reductionism with respect to the jihadists but then again that is to be expected in an epoch when Islam is a dirty word almost universally. Could have been better but still worth seeing.</Review>
            <Review>'Timbuktu' startles by acknowledging the humanity of jihadists, even as it tacitly condemns their dogmas and especially their violence.</Review>
            <Review>Sissako doesn't get trapped in mockery, and it says a lot that a tone of ruefulness prevails.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>Though the story is drawn in broad strokes and overloaded with melodrama, director Mat Whitecross' exuberant feature understands the communal joy and personal necessity of rock 'n' roll.</Review>
            <Review>The film has an engagingly zippy and colorful visual style, evoking the splashy Summer of Love motifs around the Roses, with allusions to their music videos and paint-splattered, Jackson Pollock-esque sleeve artwork.</Review>
            <Review>[The Stone Roses'] debut long player is one of the few rock albums that might justly be assessed all killer, no filler; Whitecross and Coghill's sincerely intended love letter to the era, not so much.</Review>
            <Review>None of this ever feels remotely honest or real.</Review>
            <Review>Taking its cue from the sort of pandering nostalgia that usually gets peddled to Baby Boomers, Mat Whitecross' irritating Spike Island follows a teenage gang of the Stone Roses' superfans in 1990 Manchester.</Review>
            <Review>Good gags, great performances and a spectacular soundtrack rescue an otherwise average coming-of-age drama.</Review>
            <Review>Spike Island has plenty of feckless, disorganised charm.</Review>
            <Review>The heady whirl of the Roses' first album played loud is a treat -- the only one.</Review>
            <Review>[Director Whitecross has an] uncanny visual ability with music sequences as the film joyously skips through a pitch-perfect Madchester soundtrack.</Review>
            <Review>The filmmakers botch the story with a fragmented script and harshly edited scenes that prevent us from properly engaging with anything that happens.</Review>
            <Review>The piece as a whole gets bogged down in rites-of-passage cliches and, ultimately, seems out of time.</Review>
            <Review>Whitecross clearly has both an eye and ear for the rarefied nuances of pop culture ...</Review>

        <StoryLine>From the director of WORDPLAY and I.O.U.S.A. comes a captivating look at a radically innovative approach to education. IF YOU BUILD IT follows designer-activists Emily Pilloton and Matthew Miller to rural Bertie County, the poorest in North Carolina, where they work with local high school students to help transform both their community and their lives. Living on credit and grant money and fighting a change-resistant school board, Pilloton and Miller lead their students through a year-long, full-scale design and build project that does much more than just teach basic construction skills: it shows ten teenagers the power of design-thinking to re-invent not just their town but their own sense of what's possible.

            <Review>An inspiring, educational, highly enjoyable documentary from director Patrick Creadon, best known for 2008's I.O.U.S.A., which chronicled America's less-than-healthy fiscal condition.</Review>
            <Review>The film is about innovation inside and outside the classroom and the transformative power of good teaching.</Review>
            <Review>[Creadon] probably errs on the side of advocacy here. But give him credit for acknowledging that idealistic endeavors don't always pay off.</Review>
            <Review>A bracing, quietly exhilarating documentary about a group of high school students who discover their inner architects over the course of an academic year.</Review>
            <Review>Patrick Creadon's modest 82-minute documentary is a record of good intentions in action.</Review>
            <Review>The film proves not only a stirring look at education's potential to rally and invigorate but also a vital snapshot of contemporary rural America.</Review>

            <Review>This stirring, wonderful documentary follows two idealistic, tenacious young architects arriving in the deep South to teach rural high school kids to design and build.</Review>
            <Review>This is a compelling narrative both in its own terms and as a metaphor of many of the core themes and conflicts in America today.</Review>

            <Review>What is happening! If you check out "The Forger," you might well find yourself saying that time and again, as the entertainingly terrible performances keep piling up while the plot dares you not to chuckle at the audacity of it all.</Review>
            <Review>It never for a single moment makes a plausible case for its own existence.</Review>
            <Review>In attempting to spin out its competing storylines, the crime drama "The Forger" never quite gets a handle on either one.</Review>
            <Review>Occasionally a movie comes along that's such an awkward compilation of ideas it fascinates: The Forger, a Boston-set melodrama involving cancer, Impressionist art and deadbeat dads, is only about half that good.</Review>
            <Review>Mr. Travolta teeters between tough-guy menace and soulful, artistic intensity, but you don't ever believe that he can paint or that he can beat up a whole squad of younger, bigger, meaner dudes.</Review>
            <Review>This limply directed tale emerges as a case study of an all too familiar type of art crime: the making of bad movies.</Review>
            <Review>The Forger is an uninspired and flat crime-drama that, despite its relatively sellable premise and solid casting, just doesn't come together.</Review>
            <Review>The idea is actually interesting - a dysfunctional family trying to get their act together while planning some illegality and teaching the youngster about Impressionist art - but the half-baked execution falls short.</Review>
            <Review>The Forger is a moderately entertaining, low-key combination heist film, crime picture and family drama.</Review>
            <Review>Part of the family drama works, but whatever strokes of genius it could have goes to second term and it ends up being boring. What a waste of talent. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>The script is a mess and it feels like it's two different movies, where one is interesting and the other one is a waste of time. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>A safe bet for the weekend that takes a little dignity whenever Christopher Plummer appears on screen. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>

            <Review>Pierce Brosnan embarks on the world's most tedious killing spree in this forgettable espionage drama</Review>
            <Review>Pretty much plays like a film made for basic cable that is buoyed for a while by a couple of relatively strong central performances before eventually succumbing to terminal mediocrity in its silly final scenes.</Review>
            <Review>The countdown ending is groan-inducing, as are a number of things leading up to it.</Review>
            <Review>A movie so full of ludicrous plotting and stilted exposition that it almost works as an accidental comedy.</Review>
            <Review>Amid the choppy action and whirl of sketchy characters lie muddled messages about revenge, greed, war, hubris and the endless ripple effects of 9/11.</Review>
            <Review>Bunk of the very lowest level.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately, Survivor is not so much high-octane action as a slow fizzle.</Review>
            <Review>Survivor has very little to ride on; succumbing to action-genre-conformism, the film almost takes itself too seriously in a genre that works best when it doesn't belittle the intelligence of its audience.</Review>
            <Review>Brosnan has a good time hamming it up as a heartless assassin, but why Jovovich is forced to spend the whole film darting around with black smudges on her face is a mystery.</Review>
            <Review>Survivor is an absurd film that would have done better by not taking itself so seriously.</Review>
            <Review>Reaching the end of this you'll feel like you survived something.</Review>
            <Review>I'm pretty sure I wasn't supposed to laugh out loud at several points during the press screening of Survivor, but at least I wasn't the only one.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Things are looking bleak for the members of rock band Tennis Pro. They've been struggling to connect to an audience in the Seattle music scene, with a recent run of shows drawing sparse crowds and uninspiring day jobs that are quickly eclipsing their dreams. So when an opportunity arises to take their act on the road to Japan - where the allure of a second chance at recognition awaits them - they can't refuse. Embarking on their Tokyo musical odyssey, the guys experience all the thrills and setbacks of taking their music into unknown territory (at least to them) and in the process learn a thing or two about themselves. It's just possible they won't fade away.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Minervini places these two non-actors in the same arena and no sparks whatsoever fly. It's a tedious, patience-testing experience that could reward only cinephiles and the curious.</Review>
            <Review>Authenticity is the warm blood that pumps through "Stop the Pounding Heart," a low key but mesmerizing look at adolescent awakening in a fundamentalist family.</Review>
            <Review>"Stop the Pounding Heart" transcends both the red state-blue state split and limited, didactic ideas of cinematic realism.</Review>
            <Review>A modest film made with an authenticity that commands respect, Stop the Pounding Heart adopts fundaments of neorealism and cinema verite to consider issues of faith, family and personal conviction.</Review>
            <Review>Characters who might have been portrayed as Bible Belt nut-jobs come off as unconditionally loving.</Review>
            <Review>Where Heart excels, however, is simply in capturing the rhythm of life.</Review>
            <Review>Stop the Pounding Heart becomes a sensitive, lovingly crafted illustration of the relationship between culture, faith, and identity.</Review>
            <Review>Stop The Pounding Heart is a modest production, but that's okay. You don't need a huge budget when you're working with simple truths.</Review>
            <Review>Stop the Pounding Heart is at once restrained and tactile, the work of a silently observant filmmaker who is as compassionate as he is critical.</Review>
            <Review>Minervini's achievement in this quietly impressive film is to let us see what's exceptional, rather than just odd.</Review>
            <Review>Viewers on guard for the sin of condescension will have their expectations dashed.</Review>
            <Review>Including many resonant nonfiction sequences, director Roberto Minervini captures the soul of a community by finding a new reality.</Review>

            <Review>"Marfa Girl" was filmed in 2012 but is only now reaching theaters, and as we've seen with the recent "Serena" and so many other delayed releases, that's almost never a good thing.</Review>
            <Review>Clark's sympathy for his subjects is more evident than ever.</Review>
            <Review>It's refreshing to see a film set amid the daily life of an impoverished, rural immigrant community. It's a shame the only aspect of the social world that is explored is the sexual exploits of a few teens.</Review>
            <Review>Clark clearly has a visual eye, and some of the compositions in his films are breathtaking, but unless his predilections float your boat, his movies are endurance tests.</Review>
            <Review>For all its meanderings and indulgences - verbal and visual - this free-form snapshot of a circle of townsfolk in tiny Marfa, Texas, proves a sneakily immersive, weirdly memorable affair.</Review>
            <Review>The scandal of Mr. Clark's more recent movies, including "Wassup Rockers" and "Ken Park" and this new one, resides more in its tedium and lack of insight than its strenuously provocative content.</Review>
            <Review>Oddly compelling.</Review>
            <Review>Sure, Drake Burnette's Marfa Girl looks real. But like the rest of the film, she doesn't feel real.</Review>
            <Review>When not taking timeouts for gratuitous sex, Clark's characters drone on about sex. This being the case, whatever he has to say about life on the Texas border or about the treatment of undocumented immigrants feels both inconsequential and insincere.</Review>
            <Review>More free-floating than haphazard, Clark arrays scenes of a Texas teen (bright-eyed ephebe Adam Mediano) skateboarding through drugs and sex and seemingly random run-ins in the titular West Texas small town on the occasion of his sixteenth birthday.</Review>
            <Review>Clark seems content to make a film just like all the ones that came before, but lacking in the brutal dark comedy that redeemed superior earlier efforts like Bully.</Review>
            <Review>The film finds the actors' performance deficiencies functioning less as signs of authentic teenage behavior than as an incompetent carrier of plot.</Review>

            <Review>Given the low-budget film's bottle-episode feel, horror fans could've gotten extra mileage out of a disorienting and original psychological treatment.</Review>
            <Review>It's thematically thin but competently made and good for a few scares.</Review>
            <Review>I would have loved to see more from the filmmakers, daring to fail while staking out some new terror incognita instead of just going through the motions of an experiment for which we already have the results.</Review>
            <Review>A grimy, dopey, confused thriller that wastes a very likable cast.</Review>
            <Review>Death may not be the end in The Lazarus Effect, but it should be.</Review>
            <Review>"The Lazarus Effect" boasts nothing special. It's not going to provide much relief for horror-starved audiences.</Review>
            <Review>David Gelb's new film is so dependent on the classic standbys of the genre, and so slight in every other regard, that it immediately draws attention to just how creaky they've gotten over the years</Review>
            <Review>As far as cautionary tales go, The Lazarus Effect is pretty good stuff overall and effectively rises above its mild approach to deliver a thoughtful and intense horror experience that I had a lot of fun with despite all its flaws.</Review>
            <Review>Thanks to Duplass's 'regular guy' appeal and Wilde's ability to play the girl-next-door with the same aplomb as possessed siren, The Lazarus Effect proves believable enough to be entertaining but a little too bland to leave much of a scar.</Review>
            <Review>The script gets less adventurous as it goes along, slowly shedding every intriguing idea and character detail for an utterly conventional final act.</Review>
            <Review>The Lazarus Effect is a scary movie that pokes around with some big questions, but never really goes far enough to say anything.</Review>
            <Review>Nothing fresh is brought to the screen and the stars end up treading water with well-worn cliches.</Review>

But, when a dangerous criminal learns their secret, the friends must set aside their differences and confront the paradox of a future that was once predetermined and entirely uncertain. Using an engaging blend of action, humor, and philosophy, TIME LAPSE is an original thriller that not only keeps the audience guessing, but also explores questions of pre-determination, free will and destiny.(C) Xlrator</StoryLine>

            <Review>Discovering a neighbor's photographic time machine complicates life for three young L.A. flatmates in this clever fantasy thriller.</Review>
            <Review>The biggest surprise ... is how the story continues to unsettle after it ends.</Review>
            <Review>The three central actors lack warmth or even basic rapport from the start, which makes it difficult to trust their fuzzy interpretation of the time-travel rules-or, for that matter, their tolerance for each other.</Review>
            <Review>Bradley King's Time Lapse turns run-of-the-mill roommate friction into a heated mystery with the aid of a machine that takes snapshots of the near future.</Review>
            <Review>While ultimately a flawed film, Time Lapse does do what every memorable sci-fi brainteaser should: it makes you blind to the obvious.</Review>
            <Review>It's ultimately difficult not to feel more than a little disappointed by Time Lapse's complete failure...</Review>
            <Review>Its central gimmick runs out of steam pretty quickly, causing the story logic to crumble and the suspense to dwindle.</Review>
            <Review>A great little sci-fi gem that plays with time paradoxes while adding elements of a self-contained paranoia thriller.</Review>
            <Review>A relatively contained three-hander, the main leads all deliver strong performances that are engaging and add to the tension.</Review>
            <Review>Flat performances make this time-travel by Polaroid thriller flatline.</Review>
            <Review>What was a rather pedestrian "Twilight Zone" episode may have inspired this nice little fantasy thriller. That makes it well above average for time travel films.</Review>
            <Review>A nifty little cross between Primer and Shallow Grave, with a central MacGuffin that manages to maintain its plausibility until the credits roll.</Review>

            <Review>How to discuss this giddily inventive Argentinian feature without ruining its many surprises?</Review>
            <Review>The funniest of the six stories is a brilliantly extended riot of absurdly brutal road rage.</Review>
            <Review>Szifrón brings everything to the table here: anger, rage, betrayal, malice aforethought and panic. But he leavens this with humor, style, cleverness and wit.</Review>
            <Review>Revenge may be a dish best served cold, but the dark comedy Wild Tales (Relatos salvajes) argues that payback is more satisfying when it's doled out in fiery, bloody and outrageous doses.</Review>
            <Review>Wild Tales - Relatos salvajes in its original Spanish - is, indeed, savage. And surprising. Your jaw will drop, your head will shake, more than a few times.</Review>
            <Review>Entertaining, over-the-top and more than a little anxiety-inducing.</Review>
            <Review>A wickedly funny farce about the blurred lines of morality crossed when seeking revenge.</Review>
            <Review>A bizarre collection of character on the limits of humilliaton that decide to take justice into their own hands. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>There's plenty going on here, but the films can be enjoyed simply as anarchic fun. Don't expect happy endings, though.</Review>
            <Review>This film should be fun, but all too often it may remind you of just the kinds of frustrations you went to the movies to forget.</Review>
            <Review>This is one wild film for sure and deserves all the attention it has already garnered.</Review>
            <Review>Wild Tales is not just a film you'll enjoy. It's one you'll want to talk about when it's over, either to debate the morals of the film - or to convince someone else to watch it.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>In the main, Jaume Collet-Serra is making a character-driven drama about betrayed honor, and the result is a film closer in spirit to the baggage-rich crime novels of Dennis Lehane than dumb multiplex fare.</Review>
            <Review>Run All Night is a taut, edgy affair that features Neeson in peak action form and allows him to partially atone for the indignity of Taken 3.</Review>
            <Review>There are more phones than female characters, who spend the movie comatose in hospital beds, fretting silently in the background or being hugged through a doorway</Review>
            <Review>With all due respect for Harris's ability to overact even while underacting, and given the hour-plus of citywide demolition, the stakes for the action here are awfully low.</Review>
            <Review>An admirable cat-and-mouse tale that puts forth a lot of clichés and executes them with B-movie intensity.</Review>
            <Review>"Run All Night" is proof that quality action films don't really need to reinvent the wheel each time out as long as they make it spin this smoothly.</Review>
            <Review>A rather dour example of late Liam Neeson.</Review>
            <Review>An edgy Brooklyn Irish mob hit man thriller.</Review>
            <Review>Although crafted and performed decently enough, Run All Night can't beat the feeling we're seeing a combination of films we've seen before.</Review>
            <Review>Rapper Common's appearance as the pic's bad hitman - again, the movie wants us to think there are hitmen who aren't so bad - is the film in a nutshell.</Review>
            <Review>For those who get pumped up at the thought of high-speed car chases and brutal hand-to-hand combat, rest assured Collet-Serra is bringing the goods.</Review>
            <Review>Run All Night starts out as a seemingly predictable, formulaic affair, but in the end it's a heart-pounding thriller.</Review>

            <Review>Little contained in this misfire of a film works and the few successful things are dragged out to the point where they die a lingering death.</Review>
            <Review>Shallow, dimwitted and inept. Makes "The Hangover" look like "Glengarry Glen Ross."</Review>
            <Review>A tonal mess that jumbles elements of PG-rated fare with Eurotrip-esque shenanigans.</Review>
            <Review>Not without charm, Unfinished Business mixes the cute with the raunchy.</Review>
            <Review>There's plenty to like in Unfinished Business, even though viewers expecting the debauchery of a Wedding Crashers will likely leave disappointed.</Review>
            <Review>It's an R-rated comedy due to the Germany factor. Germany has endless co-ed nudist possibilities. These are the R-rated parts. So where are the comedy parts? We're not sure.</Review>
            <Review>The only apparent "Unfinished Business" at hand in Vince Vaughn's latest is torpedoing the last remains of the actor's comedy career.</Review>
            <Review>While not without big laughs, Unfinished Business never quite connects; it's just shy of the finish line, despite some very funny surprises along the way.</Review>
            <Review>The most important unfinished business here is Steve Conrad's slapdash script, with its shifting tones, forced jokes and gaping plot holes.</Review>
            <Review>At least the three affable stars have an infectious enthusiasm, but that chemistry only goes so far when it's so difficult to find much sympathy for these bumbling losers.</Review>
            <Review>The problem is that this movie shares screen-time with a mid-2000s shock comedy. Hardly five minutes go by without something gross or disgusting happening.</Review>

            <Review>It's this time-old message of humanity, adapted to fit with today's technologies, that transcends the overpowering, at times clunky, cinematic vessel.</Review>
            <Review>Its oddly jumbled machinery never clicks. The logic of Chappie gradually disintegrates, becoming increasingly farcical.</Review>
            <Review>The principal charm of the film arises from Chappie's ears, which prick up and droop like those of a titanium rabbit.</Review>
            <Review>While the visual effects are spectacularly seamless, they're in the service of a movie which devolves from vaguely funny to just-plain silly to numbingly gory.</Review>
            <Review>There's material in Chappie for a worthwhile motion picture but too little is explored by Blomkamp to make this worth a trip to a theater.</Review>
            <Review>It may be too sloppy and indulgent to actually call good, but that still leaves room for words like heartfelt, trippy, personal, and even admirable.</Review>
            <Review>When I say Chappie reminds me of Short Circuit 2 by way of Robocop and District 9, you have to understand that I mean it in the nicest sense possible.</Review>
            <Review>Chappie makes no more sense than the ludicrous alien takeover of District 9 and is just as visually ugly, but, without a Roger Ebert to shill for it, the formula now seems especially out of date and particularly depressing.</Review>
            <Review>Chappie's problem: the hardware is solid -- it's the software that's mostly at fault.</Review>
            <Review>...a fairly substantial misfire that pales in comparison to, especially, 2013's Elysium.</Review>
            <Review>A slice of leftover science fiction warmed in a hopelessly outdated conventional oven. One bite hot, gooey goodness, the next cold and undercooked.</Review>
            <Review>Chappie's a messy film, but it's still an interesting one, made by one of the few talented young filmmakers currently working in genre film.</Review>

            <Review>There's not much plot here and very little in the way of character development. Alice is defined by her disorder and the screenplay isn't interested in delving into her life and relationships.</Review>
            <Review>No shortage of talent here. Pity they're all underused.</Review>
            <Review>Welcome to Me is an unsettling comedy, and I mean that in the best possible way.</Review>
            <Review>"Welcome to Me" has its charming, funny and sensitive moments, but it also suffers from its own form of instability.</Review>
            <Review>It's a tricky business playing someone who is mentally ill and perhaps should be confined for observation, especially in a dark comedy. Wiig manages to make Alice funny as hell, endearing, sad and sometimes a little frightening.</Review>
            <Review>There's dark comedy, and then there's take-no-prisoners, dare-you-to-keep-looking dark comedy. Kristen Wiig's "Welcome to Me" falls decidedly in the latter category, making us laugh but feel deeply unsettled about doing so.</Review>
            <Review>Wiig delivers a standout performance that manages to make Alice at once interesting, humorous, irritating and infuriating, but always successfully stops just short of making her an object of ridicule.</Review>
            <Review>A funny and touching Kristen Wiig walks an acting tightrope in this dark comedy.</Review>
            <Review>Wiig's depiction of a woman whose stories are apt to end with the declaration "then I went off my meds" is as disquieting as it is scarily accurate.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately, you are tempted to conclude that the film is a bit like Alice's chat show: a vanity project.</Review>
            <Review>Whatever the state of your mental health, you'll want to follow Alice down the rabbit hole.</Review>
            <Review>Feeling embarrassed for Alice is natural - everything you don't want her to do, she does. It's like watching your favourite sport team losing a game over and over and over.</Review>

            <Review>Proceeding with a strained quirkiness that infects much more than the names of its main characters, this first feature by Justin Reardon is a paean to the kind of narcissism that sucks the air out of every scene.</Review>

            <Review>Proving that its chosen genre is best when its tropes are treated with a balance of sincere sweetness and wink-wink absurdity, Playing It Cool thrives through sheer liveliness, as well as the chemistry of its perfectly paired stars ...</Review>
            <Review>Worst of all, though, is its wholesale waste of an insanely talented cast - and not just Evans and Monaghan... I enjoy every last one of them, but not like this. Dear god, not like this.</Review>
            <Review>Far from playing it cool, the filmmakers are trying way too hard to look cool, and so they achieve the opposite.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2015</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>115</Duration>
        <StoryLine>A romantic-drama, OLD FASHIONED centers on Clay Walsh, a former frat boy who gives up his carousing and now runs an antique shop in a small Midwestern college town. There, he has become notorious for his lofty and outdated theories on love and romance. When Amber Hewson, a free-spirited young woman with a restless soul, drifts into the area and rents the apartment above his shop, she finds herself surprisingly drawn to his noble ideas, which are new and intriguing to her. And Clay, though he tries to fight and deny it, simply cannot resist being attracted to her spontaneous and passionate embrace of life. Ultimately, Clay must step out from behind his relational theories, and Amber must overcome her own fears and deep wounds, as the two of them, together, attempt the impossible: an "old-fashioned" courtship in contemporary America.

            <Review>The leading man often seems more like a brooding menace in this handsomely produced but painfully slow faith-based romantic drama.</Review>
            <Review>It's incredibly rare to see an American movie with a Christian perspective that's more invested in philosophizing and empathizing than in eschatological pandering, and for that alone "Old Fashioned" deserves commendation.</Review>
            <Review>Disturbing is the film's apparent conviction that the surefire way to a woman's heart involves lots of candles and a mani-pedi, the sort of notion that isn't so much cute and old-fashioned as it is acutely offensive.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is self-conscious about its more on-the-nose aspects, which doesn't help much. It's also self-conscious about the weirdness of the world it espouses, which does.</Review>
            <Review>It must be pretty neat to make a movie that mostly consists of people telling you how chivalrous and morally right you are and how much everybody loves you, but that's no excuse for making it this boring.</Review>
            <Review>I admire some of Old Fashioned, but it's one that should have been a tad more accessible.</Review>
            <Review>Just because it's clean doesn't mean it's a good movie.</Review>
            <Review>Even if you agree with Clay's rigid moral stance, you'll probably be put off by this remarkably dull, tone-deaf argument for chastity.</Review>
            <Review>At least the title is accurate for this painfully wholesome romance.</Review>
            <Review>OLD FASHIONED has a great deal of trouble turning its not-very-dynamic concept -- not dating -- into a watchable movie. But it also has trouble arguing its own point.</Review>
            <Review>Old Fashioned is not only a wonderful film, it is also an absolutely essential one - especially during this day and age when intimacy seems to be on the endangered species list.</Review>
            <Review>This low-budget, faith-based film -- with a cast of mostly unknowns -- is little more than a made-for-cable movie. But it offers an endearing look at what it's like to fall in love -- not lust.</Review>

            <Review>Michael Douglas chews the spectacular desert scenery in this silly, enjoyable survival thriller.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately, the take-away from "Beyond the Reach" is this: Don't go into the desert with a guy in a blazer. Even if he offers you a martini.</Review>
            <Review>Watching Douglas behave like a narcissistic scumbag is an absolute pleasure, one in which viewers of action-adventure "Beyond the Reach" can happily indulge.</Review>
            <Review>A deadly, desert-set game of cat and mouse that is tired and beyond plausibility.</Review>
            <Review>"Beyond the Reach" is a grueling, unsatisfying thriller that fails the logic test in spectacular ways.</Review>
            <Review>Douglas is in his element and the throwback, stylized look of the production makes Beyond the Reach an entertaining hit of escapist fun.</Review>
            <Review>While Léonetti's film is never less than ridiculous, it forgets to also be fun.</Review>
            <Review>As it stands, it's simply a relentlessly brutal chase through a parched landscape that does little more than remind us that California is in the midst of its worst drought in something like six centuries.</Review>
            <Review>Douglas' gun-crazy businessman is both fascinating and hilariously creepy, carrying the film from start to finish. It's unceasingly daft, utterly implausible and shamelessly fun.</Review>
            <Review>Things go way off track at the end, but the always game Douglas gleefully chews up the scenery and has a riot delivering some jaw-droppingly bad lines. This is a film you need to see with a big, lusty audience so you can yell at the screen at the end.</Review>
            <Review>Gordon Gekko in the desert Southwest. There's really no other way to describe this sparse but ultimately rather silly B-movie thriller.</Review>
            <Review>Elevated by its sense of humor, which is connected to its political conscience: Dressed like Donald Rumsfeld playing cowboy, in a black vest, blue shirt and big hat, Michael Douglas finds economic reasons to justify his decision to commit murder.</Review>

            <Review>It's tough and unsparing, but the grimness is never gratuitous.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately the movie is wearying, but then it's likely supposed to be. If Viviane's going through the wringer, you're going through the wringer too.</Review>
            <Review>Shot in intense close-ups, the better to study the emotions burning off the characters' skin, the film is all talk and gestures, but it begins to take your breath away like a chase movie would.</Review>
            <Review>A microcosm of women victimized by patriarchal institutions worldwide as well as an allegory of the universal struggle for freedom.</Review>
            <Review>As Viviane laments, this kind of thing wouldn't happen in America. True, but there's not an actress in America who wouldn't twist her hair into a bun for the chance to play this role.</Review>
            <Review>Suspenseful, wonderfully acted, emotionally jarring.</Review>
            <Review>In terms of themes, tone, and intensity, Gett most closely compares to Asghar Farhadi's A Separation--both are seamlessly exhausting viewing experiences.</Review>
            <Review>A great testament of an intelligent woman that, throughout history, only wanted to open the roads to equality, comprehension, and tolerance. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Ronit and Shlomi Elkabetz, who based this trilogy loosely on their own family history, have managed to illuminate the humanity in the characters and turn what could be a preachy, issue-oriented movie into a moving film.</Review>
            <Review>A serious and sometimes humorous and even compassionate consideration of spousal responsibility.</Review>
            <Review>The movie's not entirely grim-there are colorful supporting characters and moments of comedy-but the experience is absolutely nerve-wracking... Given the film's political nature, that's as it should be-Gett is meant to agitate, not gratify.</Review>
            <Review>Stand out roles include Menashe Noy, who plays Amsalem's lawyer, and Sasson Gabai, who plays Elisha's lawyer and brother. However, it is Elkabetz's performance that carries the film.</Review>

        <Title>A Master Builder</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>130</Duration>
        <StoryLine>The artistic triumvirate of Jonathan Demme, Andr� Gregory, and Wallace Shawn update Henrik Ibsen's The Master Builder, a modern classic about a successful, egomaniacal architect who has spent a lifetime bullying his wife, employees and mistresses - who nonetheless wants to make peace with himself as his life approaches its final act. Working from his own translation of the Norwegian text, Wallace Shawn gives a tour-de-force performance as the cruel, yet guilt-ridden architect. Jonathan Demme's direction is based on the near-legendary production created for the stage by Andr� Gregory, developed over a 14-year period. Lisa Joyce plays a sensual, mysterious young visitor who turns the household upside down, much to the consternation of Julie Hagerty, perfectly cast as Shawn's neurasthenic, long-suffering wife. Scandinavian angst -- reinterpreted by New York's finest. (C) Abramorama</StoryLine>

            <Review>There is muscle and volume in the performances; but had Demme hung back, and kept things cooler and quieter, the mastery of what Ibsen built, and the agon of his extraordinary hero, would have cast a more looming shadow.</Review>
            <Review>For a movie that lasts longer than two hours and is made up solely of talking, it's impressive that the story never seems to drag.</Review>
            <Review>Though the film makes little effort to open up the play, letting it all unfold, as in the original, within Solness's house - if not his mind - Demme's version intensifies the drama into something oneiric.</Review>
            <Review>Surprisingly engaging ...</Review>
            <Review>A film that plays not as a theatrical antique, but as a crackling, profound entry in The Twilight Zone.</Review>
            <Review>Shawn veers away from his usual nebbishy persona here and skillfully suggests a master manipulator and shrewdly controlling womanizer driven by insecurities and guilt.</Review>
            <Review>even if it doesn't always work perfectly, it is never anything less than engrossing and perplexing, usually in equal measure</Review>
            <Review>Gregory (credited as having 'created for the stage' this version), Shawn (the translator/adaptor), and Demme (the director) nobly pursue their solid, usually convincing, but rarely exceptional concept for a manifestly challenging symbolist play. [Blu-ray]</Review>
            <Review>Demme doesn't add many visual flourishes, outside of his generous use of close-ups, but rather allows Ibsen's sharp-tongued dialogue to take center stage in a film that rewards patience.</Review>
            <Review>...pretentious tedium, with the involvement of all-star talent ... only underlining how much this film represents an opportunity squandered.</Review>
            <Review>Shawn's passion for the material shows through even when the film is at its most tautological. This is a movie crafted with care from top to bottom.</Review>
            <Review>Filmed theater? Absolutely, but also, to my complete surprise, something else again.</Review>

        <Duration>95</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Jim Sturgess (Across the Universe, 21, One Day) plays Eddie Dodson, a Melrose Avenue antiques dealer who decided to become a bank robber. Dodson drove to the banks in a black '63 Ford Galaxy LTD. He dressed up like an elegant criminal. He made mix tapes to listen to on his getaways. And in only nine months, Eddie robbed 64 banks - more than anyone has robbed before or since. Taking its aesthetic cues from Eddie Dodson and the unique moment he occupied in L.A.'s countercultural history, director Tristan Patterson has forgone the style of straight&amp;#8208;ahead biopics to create a New Wave dream of a romantic outlaw seeking self&amp;#8208;reinvention and immortality in paradise.

            <Review>First-time director Daniel Duran, working from a screenplay by Oscar Torres that abounds in the maudlin and risible, isn't able to lift the ham-handed material to a place where it might ring true.</Review>
            <Review>There is nothing brave about "Bravetown," a film so paint-by-the-numbers bland that its efforts to piggyback the sacrifice of American servicemen and women for emotional depth is downright craven.</Review>
            <Review>I would call the movie a trainwreck, except it's really four or five separate trainwrecks.</Review>
            <Review>This isn't "Bravetown." It's Crazytown.</Review>
            <Review>Satisfies mainly due to its affecting ensemble and considerable emotional intelligence.</Review>
            <Review>The film turns so overtly melodramatic during its third act that it volleys between a Nicholas Sparks film and Tropic Thunder.</Review>
            <Review>While it hints at something deeper, this slick coming-of-age drama about redemption and reconciliation instead chooses a more formulaic path to catharsis.</Review>

            <Review>The story ends up being one wrong turn after another. A GPS hasn't been invented that could get this plot-hole-riddled script back on track.</Review>
            <Review>There's a full tank of clichés for the mismatched-strangers road movie "Cas &amp; Dylan," the feature directing debut of Jason Priestley, and the sputtering is cacophonous even with two gifted actors leading the way.</Review>
            <Review>This Canadian movie, from a screenplay by Jessie Gabe, begins in Winnipeg and ends in Vancouver and jounces along on the crackle of smart-aleck dialogue mouthed by its stars, Richard Dreyfuss and Tatiana Maslany.</Review>
            <Review>Leading man Richard Dreyfuss is so irrepressibly charming that he almost saves Jason Priestley's dismal buddy comedy Cas &amp; Dylan from its awkward humor and trite sentimentality.</Review>
            <Review>Cas &amp; Dylan may have big-name talent for a small Canadian movie but mainly it has tired Hollywood formulas.</Review>
            <Review>Even if Cas &amp; Dylan isn't as polished as it could be, there are still enough pleasing moments to make this road trip worth the ride.</Review>
            <Review>Great actors stuck in predictable road-trip flick.</Review>
            <Review>It is still hard to fathom why an actor of [Richard] Dreyfuss' stature would find himself in a thin, predictable and wholly contrived indie like Cas &amp; Dylan.</Review>
            <Review>If there was an original idea in Jesse Gabe's screenplay it died of loneliness long before reaching the screen.</Review>
            <Review>Former heart-throb Jason Priestley, making his feature debut as director, keeps the banter ticking along nicely as the bug transports us to a sentimental -- but genuinely touching -- conclusion.</Review>

            <Review>Fascinating, funny, heroic, moving and may even make hockey fans out of nonbelievers.</Review>
            <Review>It's a mark of Polsky's ambition and canniness that he braids hockey not just with geopolitics but also with personal history and human drama.</Review>
            <Review>Polsky keeps things lively, both visually and with his editing. But the sometimes-lighthearted approach never undermines the serious business at hand.</Review>
            <Review>On the surface it's the story of one particular hockey player, but it reflects so much more.</Review>
            <Review>It's a story of global consequences and historic proportions, and of astounding athleticism and synchronicity - and filmmaker Polsky ices it.</Review>
            <Review>Wittily edited and beautifully scored, "Red Army" is not just a terrific film but an important one - even if you don't give two hoots about ice hockey.</Review>
            <Review>There's a lesson here for fans of any contemporary sport and an absolutely thrilling tale, impeccably assembled besides. Sporting glory awaits, even for those viewers who couldn't tell a jockstrap from a jellybean.</Review>
            <Review>Part of the interest in watching Red Army is in gauging the fluctuating relationship between Polsky and his chief subject: Fetisov can be distinctly laconic, appearing to give up his time and memories rather reluctantly.</Review>
            <Review>Red Army keeps a light tone even when dealing with serious issues, and is chock-full of great stock footage.</Review>
            <Review>It is fascinating viewing and this unfolds so much like a feature film it's remarkable the movie rights haven't already been snapped up. Someone call Stallone.</Review>
            <Review>Through a vivid collection of clips and interviews, this enlightening, rousing documentary shows us how these proud but cautious athletes have a complex love-hate relationship with the place they call home.</Review>
            <Review>What's really fascinating is the way the story evolves, with director Gabe Polsky following the story post-glasnost as the Russian players became viable commodities in the big-money National Hockey League.</Review>

        <Duration>100</Duration>
        <StoryLine>The DUFF doesn't achieve teen-movie greatness, but offers enough of a postmodern twist on the genre to recommend -- and boasts typically great work from star Mae Whitman.</StoryLine>

            <Review>This is a well-intentioned and sometimes quite sharp high school movie that falls just short of the mark due to a few way-off-the-mark scenes and too much heavy-handed preaching.</Review>
            <Review>It's hard not to see "The Duff" becoming an instant teen classic.</Review>
            <Review>Why is it so wonderful? Because wit and charm matter, and The DUFF has a good deal of both. The cast will be stars, the gags will be immortal, and you'll still be watching this movie years from now.</Review>
            <Review>Whitman displays flawless comic timing and consistently makes inspiring choices in terms of delivery, reaction, even the slightest facial expression. She shines confidently in a self-deprecating role, and it's irresistible.</Review>
            <Review>It's not "Mean Girls." It's not even "Easy A." But it's definitely a solid B.</Review>
            <Review>It's the first great teen comedy since Mean Girls.</Review>
            <Review>Always fun to see how high school gets techno-updated. The phone-and-social-media insanity portrayed here makes the beepers of 1995's 'Clueless' look like trilobite fossils.</Review>
            <Review>The DUFF brings something different to the genre.</Review>
            <Review>An earnest high-school comedy that mostly feels like the dried-out, overheated leftovers of John Hughes.</Review>
            <Review>As she proved in Arrested Development, Whitman is great -- although without her tremendous comic skill The DUFF would be, well, duff.</Review>
            <Review>[Mae Whitman] helps elevate a predictable story into one many won't mind watching.</Review>
            <Review>It occasionally plays like a mashup of Mean Girls and Easy A, but Whitman's performance gives The DUFF a spiky energy all its own.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>45</Duration>
        <StoryLine>There was a time when interracial dating was a taboo practice that could lead to physical harm or even death. Today it seems to be of greater acceptance as with celebrity power couples Kanye West and Kim Kardashian or Ice-T and Coco. "The Swirl" takes a comedic look at this serious topic by digging into the cultural shift in attitudes around interracial relationships.(c) Moguldum</StoryLine>

        <Title>Farewell, Herr Schwarz</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2015</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>97</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Winner of the Best Documentary Prize at the Haifa International Film Festival, director Yael Reuveny's Farewell Herr Schwarz is a cinematic journey about buried family secrets, the Holocaust (from a third generation perspective) and how it is never too late to reclaim your heritage. Siblings Michla and Feiv'ke Schwarz survived the Holocaust but never reunited after the war. Michla moved to the soon-to-be-founded Jewish state in the Middle East and started a family there. Her brother Feiv'ke considered dead returned to East Germany, married a German woman and inexplicably lived amidst the concentration camp ruins where he was once a prisoner. The Israeli and German sides to the family lived unaware of each other for half a century until first time filmmaker Yael Reuveny probed exactly what happened to her family in 1945.

            <Review>Interweaving multiple perspectives and three generations of family memories, Yael Reuveny's "Farewell Herr Schwarz" traces a Holocaust mystery with stumbling curiosity and endearing sincerity.</Review>
            <Review>This fascinating autobiographical documentary explores the world of Holocaust survivors and their descendants with an unusual story.</Review>
            <Review>An absorbing documentary that eloquently explores questions about forgiveness.</Review>
            <Review>Farewell Herr Schwarz ends with tentative bonds of conciliation and family renewal, but the film offers no false answers to the terrible conundrum of remembering and forgetting catastrophe.</Review>
            <Review>Reuveny's film unfolds with the amorphousness of memory, her family's story told in a way so personal that it feels more like a private genealogy project than a doc fit for the public.</Review>
            <Review>Farewell, Herr Schwarz is of a kind with 2011's excellent The Flat...</Review>
            <Review>A suspenseful, surprising and intriguing emotional journey.</Review>
            <Review>Farewell, Herr Schwarz examines the psychological impact of the shocking news for all three generations through a series of simple conversations with Reuveny.</Review>
            <Review>The sobering quality that informs both the documentary's aesthetic and content largely suppresses any spontaneity or much-needed moments of levity.</Review>
            <Review>A bittersweet documentary detailing an attempt to reconcile a pair of siblings' polar opposite approaches to surviving the Holocaust.</Review>
            <Review>A complex consideration of what it is to be Jewish and the lengthy aftereffects of atrocities perpetuated on one's past generations, 'Farewell, Herr Schwarz' is an important addition to Holocaust cinema.</Review>
