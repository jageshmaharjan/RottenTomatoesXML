            <Review>Mutual Friends isn't awful by any means, but that doesn't make it any good.</Review>

        <Title>Journey to the Seventh Planet</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 1962</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>80</Duration>
        <StoryLine>This passable low-budget science fiction oddity stars John Agar as the leader of a scientific mission to Uranus (not mentioned in the movie's title in order to avoid the inevitable chuckles), where the crew fall under the control of a powerful psychic force apparently emanating from the planet itself. The entity in question is able to tap into the astronauts' minds, giving physical form to both their greatest desires and most terrifying nightmares. This intelligent sci-fi premise is nearly identical to Soviet director Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 art-house epic Solaris, which took three hours to tell nearly the same story. As if that weren't enough d�j� vu, the story is set in the year 2001, calling to mind a certain space odyssey which changed the face of science fiction cinema a mere seven years later. Though a far less significant entry in the annals of movie history, Journey to the Seventh Planet is at least uncluttered by the intellectual posturing which predominates the latter two films.</StoryLine>

            <Review>A sweetly affecting Chinese film about a elderly man who opens his spoiled granddaughter to the analog world during a road trip across rural China ...</Review>
            <Review>The Nightingale is a beautifully photographed, well-acted parable about tradition and change in modern-day China, that will either move you to tears or strike you as overly saccharine and formulaic.</Review>
            <Review>Well acted and beautifully photographed, the movie offers a window into both modern urban and traditional Chinese life.</Review>
            <Review>The Nightingale doesn't aspire to be much more than a heartwarming road movie through rural China, and at that, it succeeds admirably.</Review>
            <Review>Sounding dry and portentous on paper, it is actually a heart-warming affair centred around its two central performances.</Review>
            <Review>Although competently crafted, the film lacks excitement of any sort.</Review>
            <Review>Vibrant, uplifting and authentic.</Review>

            <Review>What emerges is a tapestry of despair, one defined by its persistence.</Review>
            <Review>Filmed almost entirely inside the Pathway Home in California, a residential therapy center for veterans, this devastatingly raw documentary shows that for some the fighting may stop, but the suffering continues.</Review>
            <Review>The horrors of the battlefield come home to roost in ways that are both riveting and deeply disturbing in Of Men and War, a remarkable chronicle of Iraq War veterans suffering from the devastating effects of PTSD.</Review>
            <Review>The devastating toll of post-traumatic stress disorder inflicted by the Iraq and Afghanistan wars on U.S. soldiers is vividly presented in Of Men and War, a slow-burn documentary from France's Laurent Becue-Renard.</Review>
            <Review>Disregard your personal feelings about the military, U.S. involvement in foreign wars, or a French director making a movie about Americans. This film is raw in the truest sense, yet refined in its sympathy and scope.</Review>
            <Review>For all the individual horrors it documents, Of Men and War... is organized as a collective experience, following multiple, mostly unnamed veterans as they share in group or in pairs, expressing rage and fear, frustration, and small pleasures.</Review>
            <Review>A hard-hitting documentary which zeroes in on the harrowing experiences of veterans and their families as they struggle to reclaim their lives.</Review>
            <Review>Bécue-Renard shows the Pathway Home not as a means through which to forget wartime experiences, but to engage with the memory of them.</Review>
            <Review>There is no battle footage or graphic imagery, but it's excruciating to watch -- a series of devastating, nakedly human moments showing the cost of war on the men sent to fight it.</Review>
            <Review>So many war films talk about U.S. veterans suffering from PTSD. . . shows someone actually doing something effective about it - of veterans, for veterans, and by veterans.</Review>
            <Review>A work of astounding sensitivity and precision, it argues for emotional honesty as a moral and psychic imperative.</Review>

            <Review>This ecologically themed horror movie scores points for atmosphere and imagination, though it isn't particularly scary. The characters are little more than ciphers, so I wasn't inclined to root for them when they got into trouble.</Review>
            <Review>In a departure from the sexually active teens of most slasher movies, "The Hallow" plays on more grown-up fears: keeping your family safe and steering clear of a vengeful Mother Nature.</Review>
            <Review>This backwoods monster movie boasts compelling performances, eye-catching creatures and an effective blend of practical and digital effects.</Review>
            <Review>Amid all the horror and the black ooze, there emerges a deeply touching story about the power of love.</Review>
            <Review>Pretty quickly, you'll be suffering from fiend fatigue.</Review>
            <Review>High on atmosphere and chills, but only passable when it comes to anything beyond surface-deep emotional content. It's almost there, but just shy of greatness.</Review>
            <Review>While it won't leave you the unwelcome gift of nightmares, The Hallow is an admirable first-time out for director Corin Hardy. You can see where every cent was spent, but that kind of adds to the fun.</Review>
            <Review>A sophisticated and scary horror picture with way above-average effects.</Review>
            <Review>This gloomy little film has neither the imagination nor the effects to carry off its story.</Review>
            <Review>The Hallow promises to be an Irish mythological horror, replete with wee folk and banshees. Unhappily, it merely namechecks these entities and delivers nothing of the sort.</Review>
            <Review>Some scattered thrills can't overcome the pedestrian trappings of this monster movie.</Review>
            <Review>What starts off as a decent psychological thriller ceases to be really frightening when we see the Orc-type creatures.</Review>

            <Review>An archetypal story made compelling by honest performances but undone by its docu-fiction style.... Bedford shirked the responsibility of building out authenticity within the film's narrative world.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director Hank Bedford's Mississippi-set romantic drama would have benefited from judicious tightening and a rethink of its uninspired, decidedly downbeat crime element.</Review>
            <Review>This is well-worn territory, and though the two leads are very good, the romance that is supposed to drive the story isn't particularly well delineated ...</Review>
            <Review>Chris Zylka and Riley Keough ignite a convincing spark as lovers who dream of wider horizons. Even so, their fateful course unwinds less than persuasively, the vivid sense of place not enough to bring the one-last-heist setup fully to life.</Review>
            <Review>Bedford intercuts the narrative by interviewing actual residents of the town where he shot the film; all of their stories touch on death more movingly than the fictional script does.</Review>
            <Review>Striding right up to the unkempt front lawn of white-trashploitation (and occasionally trespassing), Hank Bedford's indie feature debut marshals a pungent Mississippi stink at the expense of a deeper dimension.</Review>

            <Review>Low on ideas and high on atmosphere, "Dixieland" is a promising debut, but it likely won't find you overwhelmingly writing back home about it.</Review>

            <Review>This ungainly B movie makes virtually no sense in terms of either mythology or basic plotting.</Review>
            <Review>Cherry Tree is a story of witchcraft that's stuck on fast-forward as it zooms ahead with a disappointing attention to plotting (in favor of gore and centipedes).</Review>
            <Review>...instead of developing a believable story or characters that behave in recognizably human ways, it tries to buy off the audiences with images of bare breasts, creepy insects, and lots of graphic, gory body horror.</Review>
            <Review>You may go in... hoping for the baroque irrationality of Dario Argento's Suspiria, the stylised mother of all witchcraft movies, but what you get instead is something closer to the shrill silliness of Suspiria's belated sequel The Mother of Tears.</Review>
            <Review>Coasts along at such an energetic clip that it's hard to not have a little fun with all the crazy witch madness.</Review>
            <Review>Impossible to take seriously.</Review>
            <Review>Brendan McCarthy's script is a cliché stack, the heroine's a blank and the villains are paper tigers.</Review>
            <Review>For all its technical prowess, this is an anemic, nonsensical horror opus that seldom goes anywhere of interest, everything building to a terribly unsatisfying conclusion that's forgettable and bland.</Review>
            <Review>The film is nothing but a clumsy constructed yarn with a final scene/shot so cheap and misguided; it sums up Keating's clunker with aplomb.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>First-time director Sean Mewshaw and screenwriter Desi Van Til - they're married - have decided, intriguingly, to craft a movie about loss and letting go. And they've done so with uncommon humor and heart.</Review>
            <Review>Tumbledown comes up light in the categories that matter most, miring a capable cast in a forced cable-knit folksiness familiar to anyone who has ever watched anything set in New England.</Review>
            <Review>Tumbledown is a sweetly poignant look at what it means to move on.</Review>
            <Review>Hall and Sudeikis circle around one another warily, erupting into defensiveness, shutting each other out, then letting each other back in. There's a rhythm to it. Mewshaw helps sustain that rhythm.</Review>
            <Review>We're meant to warm to Hannah and Andrew as they wear each other down with good-natured ribbing. But Ms. Hall and Mr. Sudeikis hardly warm up themselves, showing little chemistry and looking unsure how to play the film's tone, or the would-be zingers.</Review>
            <Review>"Tumbledown" sees its good intentions undermined by cloying sitcom conventions.</Review>
            <Review>'Tumbledown' is not-quite-a-humdinger about a dead folk singer, featuring funnyman Jason Sudeikis as a surprisingly effective romantic lead, and as such-it's right nice.</Review>
            <Review>A film that survives by its atmosphere, Tumbledown finds itself floundering at moments that are more plot oriented.</Review>
            <Review>As a study of grief, it's moving, featuring authentic performances and a keen understanding of the receding hibernation that comes with losing a cornerstone person in one's life.</Review>
            <Review>This one rewards the viewer with a typically fine performance by Rebecca Hall and a revelatory one by Jason Sudeikis, whom we usually associate with comedy.</Review>
            <Review>"Tumbledown" is like listening to a favorite album on a cold winter's day.</Review>
            <Review>... has trouble keeping its disparate elements together, although there are some touching character-driven moments along the way.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>Despite its many drawbacks, Subkoff's film deserves to be seen, if only for its wildly imaginative use of the medium and for the urgency of its message, which is dire, bleak - and unforgettable.</Review>
            <Review>First-time director Subkoff shoots even the mundane sniping in horror mode, and makes the hallucinations pay vivid dividends:</Review>
            <Review>It's... made with verve, style, and sparing gore by Tara Subkoff, whose overwrought concern for kids today is more than made up for by her promising debut's grimly mysterious mood and flair for the hipster grotesque.</Review>
            <Review>"#Horror" is a bit like someone who is genuinely scared of something but tries to laugh it off.</Review>
            <Review>For all its bursts of violence and descending-guillotine sound effects, "#Horror" feels driven more by social commentary than by outright terror.</Review>
            <Review>There is a method to Tara Subkoff's directorial madness, and what she has put to film is nothing if not bizarrely, indelibly auspicious.</Review>
            <Review>#Horror fails to even work as an cult oddity.</Review>
            <Review>#Horror is a prime example of style over substance.</Review>
            <Review>#Horror has plenty to say about cyberbullying, but it gets lost in frantic editing and bitchy stereotypes along the way.</Review>
            <Review>A blunt satire of the dehumanization inherent in social media that also gets off on said detachment.</Review>
            <Review>#Horror isn't a fun watch, and what it says is hardly profound.</Review>

            <Review>There's not much to be said about Sonny Mallhi's languid psychological drama - moonlighting as a possession-centered horror film - that hasn't already been said by the title.</Review>
            <Review>Anguish isn't the scariest or most original thriller but it's a surprisingly involving and creepy one.</Review>
            <Review>If ever a film failed to live up to its title... mild impatience, more like it.</Review>
            <Review>A film called Anguish hardly sounds enticing but I think I'd prefer anguish to what this arthouse horror actually serves up, which is plain tedium.</Review>
            <Review>We get a fair bit of indie-aimless drifting, with some hokey jump-scares weirdly bolted on, borrowed from Carrie and The Exorcist.</Review>
            <Review>This type of horror film should leave a lasting impression but Anguish languishes lost and anxious in sub-genre limbo.</Review>
            <Review>Preoccupied with the haunting of both an individual and a community, Anguish has its creepy moments - but these are offset by an autumnal lyricism, and a focus on the interplay between Tess' teen alienation and her fraught attempts to find her place.</Review>
            <Review>Stand[s] out from the glut of more recent horror efforts, particularly graphic and gruesome "torture porn"... A haunting and emotionally moving mood piece.</Review>
            <Review>This is a horror movie that starts with characters and then moves to scares, a rare thing these days, and because we do care for these characters so much, it's that much more terrifying when their very souls are at stake.</Review>
            <Review>Anguish highlights four people in various degrees of mental and emotional pain, and while the narrative tissue here is a supernatural one the beating heart beneath it all is as real and affecting as they come.</Review>

            <Review>Krause's deadpan wit, coupled with the inspired scenes at Spirit Possessions Anoymous, make Ava's Possessions a fun, fresh take on a genre staple.</Review>
            <Review>A goofy horror movie with little to say and not a lot to see, "Ava's Possessions" sacrifices scares in favor of a rambling addiction metaphor that never finds an emotional rhythm.</Review>
            <Review>Jordan Galland's Ava's Possessions begins where most demonic-possession movies end.</Review>
            <Review>Galland's film plays more like a cable-ready mystery than a cult film in the making, offering just enough chuckles to stay afloat... Still, it's a nice alternative to yet another self-serious Exorcist wannabe.</Review>
            <Review>It veers into conventional horror and feel-good territory, gradually losing its edge.</Review>
            <Review>[T]he horror world needs more movies as original as Ava's Possessions and preferably, much less sequels.</Review>
            <Review>While impressive for a low-budget horror comedy, goes off on too many tangents, ending up as an intriguing premise imperfectly realized.</Review>
            <Review>It becomes increasingly serious, creating an awkward middle-of-the-road tone in which neither comedy nor horror delivers a punch.</Review>
            <Review>Ava's Possessions is a fantastic take on demon-centric storytelling and offers fans something a bit different and far more character-driven than we've seen in the horror genre as of late.</Review>
            <Review>Galland is a skilled world builder. He takes these very familiar big screen scenarios, puts his own smart spin on them and then he winds up with these especially appealing and thoughtful concepts that are a blast to consider well beyond the feature.</Review>
            <Review>Ava's Possessions may not be a thing of nightmares, but Galland's take on post-exorcism lifestyles is fun and inviting, in a quirky-satanic-hangover kind of way.</Review>
            <Review>Ava's Possessions isn't a bad film by any stretch, but it's frustrating to watch it plod along while an abundance of promise sits just outside of the frame.</Review>

            <Review>Funny quasi-horror pic keeps viewers guessing.</Review>
            <Review>Within its commercial framework, they're taking real chances - and 'Creep' is, in many ways, a puzzling character study in a found-footage horror movie's clothing.</Review>

            <Review>The new movie, as an act of pure storytelling, streams by with fluency and zip.</Review>
            <Review>That's what's so impressive about the tricky balancing act Abrams has pulled off with The Force Awakens: He's made a movie that's simultaneously gripping and a huge release. We are in good hands, at last.</Review>
            <Review>With The Force Awakens, Abrams has begun one of the most important reclamation projects of our time: the complete erasure from cultural memory of The Phantom Menace and its sequels.</Review>
            <Review>I bet you'll have fun - I did, mostly. But it's the fun of seeing something fairly successfully redone, with the promise of more of the same to come.</Review>
            <Review>It's everything the kid in us goes to the movies for -- marvelous adventure that leaves us surprised, scared and euphoric.</Review>
            <Review>It's a big Star Wars universe out there and Abrams has just made it bigger again with this mix of fan boy homage and a fresh and quirky vision of his own.</Review>
            <Review>The Force Awakens is fun. I'm not sure that it's great. ... But on the heels of the prequels, well, maybe fun is all we really need.</Review>
            <Review>As the most anticipated film release that I can remember in some time, "The Force Awakens" has some big shoes to fill. And fill them it does.</Review>
            <Review>Star Wars: The Force Awakens honors the series and takes it in exciting new directions. Both The Millennium Falcon and millennials, it would seem, are in good hands.</Review>
            <Review>What we've got here is a film that managed, on the first try, to turn the engine over in a car that has been collecting dust for 32 years. Now, they didn't drive it anywhere, so we can't tell if it was worth the effort.</Review>
            <Review>What is the Force, and Jedi-ism? In Star Wars, it refers to the ability of a high-level martial-artist-knight to use supernormal abilities. Science has proven 6 of them.</Review>

            <Review>Boldly reimagining Kathryn Bigelow's cult favorite as a movie where absolutely nobody seems to be having any fun, the new Point Break drops the original's Zen-like balance of macho mysticism and camp in favor of dour humorlessness.</Review>
            <Review>A remake that ought not to have been made.</Review>
            <Review>Stiff, humorless, tension-free ...</Review>
            <Review>Nowhere does Mr. Core's film approach the action-movie chops or psychological smarts of Ms. Bigelow's original or, truth be told, benefit from actors displaying the same charm as her stars.</Review>
            <Review>Tedious and overblown - as though the filmmakers were so preoccupied with "updating" the material that they forgot what made it so popular in the first place.</Review>
            <Review>Even with the amazing stunt work and excellent cinematography, it's all just going through the motions, dragging us in to the closing credits.</Review>
            <Review>The fatal flaw of Point Break is that it's trying to be smarter than it is and the plot becomes convoluted.</Review>

            <Review>A deeply conflicting version of fun.</Review>
            <Review>Quentin Tarantino's The Hateful Eight is a lot of things. Boring, of course, isn't one of them.</Review>
            <Review>This is Tarantino. And it's very entertaining, even when it's entertainingly vile, which happens a lot in this overlong movie's extended third act.</Review>
            <Review>The film is pointless, even as entertainment, because it builds to nothing more than a comic book blood bath.</Review>
            <Review>What was it about this cramped, underdeveloped parlor drama -- the majority of which takes place on one set -- that caused Tarantino to think 70mm?</Review>
            <Review>The Hateful Eight is too extreme, too ghoulishly violent, too besieged by its ensemble's overriding villainy, to feel like anything but a dark chamber piece.</Review>
            <Review>The Hateful Eight is part Reservoir Dogs, Django Unchained and Clue. It has the best and worst of Tarantino. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Reasonably good.</Review>
            <Review>Sprawling throughout, with clearly delineated sections that are alternately very talky and very bloody, I loved it. But your mileage may vary.</Review>
            <Review>Even its obvious weaknesses have the courage of their convictions, and the strengths are terrific.</Review>
            <Review>Over-the-top bloody...so be prepared for an adult evening out. And an entertaining one.</Review>

            <Review>There are scenes here unlike anything you've seen. Timely, thoughtful and supremely well-constructed, we'd be stunned if this isn't the doc to beat on Oscar night.</Review>
            <Review>This raw and compelling (if necessarily incomplete) documentary focuses on the recent battles between drug cartels and vigilantes along the Arizona-Mexico border.</Review>
            <Review>Shot in times of serious danger, it balances idealism and violence, triggering an adrenaline high and a sense of soul-crushing hopelessness in the same instant.</Review>
            <Review>Even if it leaves you wanting more, "Cartel Land" deserves to be seen.</Review>
            <Review>Much of the documentary Cartel Land, an immersion into the Mexican drug traffickers and citizen vigilantes, is hair-raisingly intense.</Review>
            <Review>One of the year's most important documentaries ...</Review>
            <Review>A little bit of critical distance could surely only have helped make this is a real discussion of the issues, not just a vivid depiction of them.</Review>
            <Review>Cartel Land shows us things we haven't seen before, and its last act contains startling revelations. But the film is also pretty tacky in its numbingly high-octane presentation</Review>
            <Review>Cartel Land is surprisingly effective in its on-the-ground approach.</Review>
            <Review>A real-life action thriller, a terrifying, companion piece to Sicario. Do we want the wild West in the 21st century? Because that's what we've got.</Review>
            <Review>More than a great documentary, this is a great piece of journalistic work. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>The longer it goes, the easier it becomes to be turned off by the frequent graphic violence that so frequently punctuates the narrative.</Review>

            <Review>The movie murmurs, when it - and others - should be shouting.</Review>
            <Review>A melodramatic but compelling enough lab-coat drama about football players and the pathological implications of too many blows to their heads ...</Review>
            <Review>Just in time for the NFL playoffs, here comes "Concussion," a movie that will hopefully give many serious pause about our nation's most popular sport.</Review>
            <Review>While "Concussion" has some fine things going for it, notably science and Will Smith, it lacks the exciting, committed filmmaking that rises to the level of its outrageous topic.</Review>
            <Review>Concussion's dramatic core is solid and its unwillingness to sugarcoat the NFL's tactics is likely to raise some eyebrows.</Review>
            <Review>Landesman has pushed too hard to make this story fit into a dramatic mold, alternating melodrama and romance with those earnest warnings in a way that is more ungainly than effective.</Review>
            <Review>The story is just so extraordinary that you can't help but be drawn in, and it is the kind of film you should see at least once.</Review>
            <Review>All the elements of a solid drama are here, yet in trying to overplay every single one of them Landesman winds up diminishing the whole, reaching for importance but coming away with a handful of adequacy.</Review>
            <Review>Built on a solid performance by Will Smith</Review>
            <Review>Peter Landesman strains to make Omalu's battles feel just and epic in scale, but the drama feels as doughy and shapeless as an athlete too long out of training.</Review>
            <Review>Concussion outwardly appears to be a sports drama about brain injury but it is actually a hagiography of Dr Omalu, and this weakens it.</Review>
            <Review>Even as 'Concussion' clouds the hard-core problem with soft side issues, it is a best step so far in the right direction.</Review>

            <Review>Shot in the early 70s but shelved for 40 years, this portrait of R&amp;B great Leon Russell (1974) immediately takes its place among the best rock docs.</Review>
            <Review>This film was never released in theaters - it was obviously way too far out and ragged for its own good. But it works nicely as a warped time capsule harkening back to strange days.</Review>
            <Review>I like Russell's music, but I learned absolutely nothing about him.</Review>
            <Review>In the '70s, this would've been an unusually intimate tour portrait. Now, it's a newly unearthed time capsule, the remarkable clarity of Blank's portrait compounded by the distance from which we're looking at it.</Review>
            <Review>In essence, the real audience for this are Leon Russell aficionados, of which there are fewer today than in 1974.</Review>
            <Review>"A Poem Is a Naked Person" is a tuneful peculiarity, capturing singer-songwriter Leon Russell and his bandmates, his friends, guest musicians and Oklahoma eccentrics.</Review>
            <Review>A glorious time capsule bursting with life.</Review>
            <Review>Unfortunately, most of the film is given over to musicians, baked and bickering endlessly in recording studios.</Review>
            <Review>A brilliant, free flowing depiction of a time, a place and the people who inhabit it.</Review>
            <Review>A down and dirty mash-up of colourful sound and imagery.</Review>
            <Review>It moves away from Russell to something else, somewhere else, to scenes and images that are beside the point. But that is the point.</Review>
            <Review>This bewildering, kaleidoscopic journey on a magic carpet ride is well-worth experiencing.</Review>

            <Review>With the intensified focus on use of force in police departments, the unsettling documentary "Killing Them Safely" couldn't be timelier.</Review>
            <Review>Mr. Berardini's packed documentary makes its case early and often, perhaps too often, but it's more chilling than your average issue film.</Review>
            <Review>Berardini's doc vigorously proves that despite their marketing, Tasers are not the answer. They are only means to a bigger, deadlier problem.</Review>
            <Review>Relying entirely on flawed cases and weak lawsuits from the mid-2000s, "Killing Them Safely" is a very poor indictment of TASER International, the manufacturer of the widely used and mostly safe electronic weapon.</Review>
            <Review>Footage of the now-wealthy Smiths being deposed is damning, the brothers' legal jiujitsu is appalling, and the stories of deaths are heartbreaking.</Review>
            <Review>An important account of shifts in policing tactics and the problematic interaction between law enforcement and private companies.</Review>
            <Review>Killing Them Safely is, above all, an example of excellent, ethical, fair, and balanced journalism allowing both sides to state their case.</Review>
            <Review>A dark comedy about humanity's knack for quickie solutions and our ability to lie to ourselves, especially when our noble deeds go awry.</Review>
            <Review>Though at times not for the fainthearted, Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle takes subject matter many of us probably give little thought to at all in day to day life and asks us to consider it deeply.</Review>
            <Review>Therein lies Berardini's critique: using naught but his subjects' own words, he paints a portrait of men who have been dazzled by profits at the expense of their ethics.</Review>

        <StoryLine>This remarkably timely, eye-opening film charts the death-defying struggle of African migrants as they risk everything to start a new life in Europe. Ayiva (first time actor Koudous Seihon in a revelatory performance) and Abas (Alassane Sy) are close friends from Burkina Faso determined to make it to Italy in order to find work and provide for their families back home. But even after surviving the harrowing journey-desert bandits, a treacherous sea voyage, arrest-nothing can prepare the two men for the hostility and violence that awaits them. A gripping tale of survival told with vivid realism, Mediterranea immerses viewers in the heart of a humanitarian crisis that for far too many is a lived reality.</StoryLine>

            <Review>This debut feature from director Jonas Carpignano is often both harrowing and moving though this film festival favorite...falls short of some of the similar, and even more tragic, stories that can be heard just by turning on the news.</Review>
            <Review>It's a slow-burn study in feeling powerless and unwelcome, anchored by Seihon's performance as a man patient and adept at sussing out and adapting to what others need until he just can't do it any longer.</Review>
            <Review>This is a story packed with the sort of heartbreak and worry that would be hard to sit through were it not for American director Jonas Carpignano's touching, tender narrative skill.</Review>
            <Review>Offers a deliberately muted, finely textured account of the ordeals many Africans endure both before and after voyages to Europe in search of better lives.</Review>
            <Review>Carpignano glosses over much of the sociopolitical context in his depictions of the chain of events.</Review>
            <Review>This calm, hardheaded film never sacrifices its toughness for a swooning, misty-eyed moment of hope.</Review>
            <Review>There are few films that navigate the refugee experience in recent years that operate with the same attention to detail.</Review>
            <Review>A timely humanistic immigration film.</Review>
            <Review>Though realized with great empathy and tact, the film fails to convey the catastrophic extent of the situation it addresses by keeping its narrative too tightly focused.</Review>
            <Review>Sad story about the struggles of two brothers from Burkina Faso who journey to Italy in hopes of finding a better life.</Review>
            <Review>If you're the sort to wonder what it is that drives people to leave their homes to find work in other countries, or even other continents, then think of the film as an educational experience.</Review>
            <Review>"Mediterranea" does not solely owe its topicality to recent events, like the tragic sinking of an immigrant boat bound for Italy off the coast of Libya that resulted in 400 deaths, it will induce a shiver of recognition for American viewers too.</Review>

            <Review>In a standard cowering-town-needs-a-gunfighter drama, typical themes (redemption, forgiveness) are laid out with little imagination.</Review>
            <Review>Father and son team up for a Western in the classic style.</Review>
            <Review>Forsaken greatly benefits from the poignant teaming of its father-and-son stars -- as well as Michael Wincott as an especially elegant and eloquent gunfighter who has great respect for John.</Review>
            <Review>It has a solid story to tell, and tells it with no winks and few, if any, frills. It's involving and ultimately exciting.</Review>
            <Review>Solid and dependable, "Forsaken" shouldn't be forgotten. But I wish so much of it didn't feel half-remembered.</Review>
            <Review>Fans of the genre - and the cast - may find it a pleasant enough diversion, but given the recent wave of strong frontier dramas, this film feels especially minor.</Review>
            <Review>If you're a fan of the genre' you won't be disappointed by FORSAKEN.</Review>
            <Review>A humdrum Western which never demonstrates even the suggestion of a trick up its sleeve.</Review>
            <Review>It should please those who like their westerns the old-fashioned way.</Review>
            <Review>Forsaken is still a film to be enjoyed. The performances themselves justify that.</Review>
            <Review>Because of its intriguing emphasis on the strained father/son relationship, 'Forsaken' ends up being a compelling drama as well as a wonderful addition to the Western genre.</Review>
            <Review>Forsaken offers sufficient gun battles, standoffs, and shot-him-dead moments to keep fans of superficial Westerns entertained, but its revenge story is unfalteringly by-the-books.</Review>

            <Review>In certain mutilated pictures, you can detect the lineaments of greatness: Consider Orson Welles's "The Magnificent Ambersons." Here, that's not the case.</Review>

            <Review>It's clearly intended as a magical-realist take on very genuine social conflicts, but the result, in this edit at least, is a trial to sit through.</Review>
            <Review>What is being released is a baffling hodge-podge of a movie, full of contradictory elements. Bits of it, seen in isolation, are effective and atmospheric, but the plotting is tangled and confused.</Review>

        <StoryLine>A five-man unit of cops on night patrol get more than they bargain for when they arrive at a creepy backwater town in the middle of nowhere after a call comes over the radio for backup. Entering a derelict building, the seasoned tough guys and their rookie junior, who's still haunted by a traumatic childhood dream, do the one thing you should never do in this kind of movie: they split up. They soon realize they've stumbled into a monstrous charnel house and descend into an ever-more nightmarish netherworld where grotesque, mind-wrenching horrors await them at every turn. This is one baskin (that's "police raid" to you non-Turkish speakers) that isn't going to end well. But wait! Things aren't what they seem in this truly disturbing, outrageously gory, and increasingly surreal film whose unpredictable narrative slippages pull the carpet from under your feet and keep you guessing right up to the final moment. A wildly original whatsit that reconfirms Turkey as the breakout national cinema of the moment.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Hey, Nicolas Winding Refn: this is how it's done.</Review>
            <Review>Part art film slow burn and part extreme splatterfest, Baskin is best enjoyed as a movie that features the memorable image of a man gouging out someone's eyeball with a knife and then French-kissing the bloody socket.</Review>
            <Review>The pacing is slack and the splatter excessive, but this twisted cross-genre exercise should be red meat to gore-hounds.</Review>
            <Review>A torture-gore blowout that rises above pure nausea with an intriguing blur of possible realities.</Review>
            <Review>"Baskin" is a perfectly imbalanced mix of chilly atmosphere, heavy-handed symbolism, and familiar horror-movie tropes.</Review>
            <Review>Tickling the mind even as it lurches the gut, "Baskin," a stylish, shape-shifting horror film from Turkey, pulls a bait-and-switch.</Review>
            <Review>Baskin never loses its genuine identity that makes it outstand on the billboard that needs more films like this. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>A good example of a short film used as a direct way to a film debut. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Baskin resorts to abstraction argument to string together a series of grisly vignettes that are depleted in their own visual impact. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>For all the mortified, mottled flesh and salacious shots of butcher's equipment, Baskin is just not very frightening.</Review>
            <Review>Sinister? Sadistic? Spine chilling? Check, check, check. This is a really nifty modern horror.</Review>
            <Review>This slowburn Turkish shocker suggests what might have happened if Once Upon a Time in Anatolia's philosophically inclined patrolmen had blundered into Eli Roth territory.</Review>

            <Review>Reflecting influences ranging from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre to Rosemary's Baby to -- well, you name it -- Bleed doesn't exactly break any new ground, stylistically or otherwise.</Review>
            <Review>Too derivative and not stylish enough to merit any special championing, as indie B-horror movies go, it's nonetheless nicely crafted enough to rate a cut above the low-expectation median.</Review>
            <Review>Bleed is really nothing you haven't seen before, but there's still some pretty interesting elements that result from its mixtape approach.</Review>
            <Review>Bleed is familiar, by-the-numbers horror filmmaking, but it's also short and sweet enough to capitalize on cheap thrills.</Review>
            <Review>The filmmakers handle their material efficiently, but it's hard to imagine anyone familiar with the genre finding Bleed fresh or as vividly scary as its predecessors.</Review>

            <Review>An hour and fifteen minutes of tedium is too long to wait for two or three minutes of pleasantly cheesy.</Review>
            <Review>The movie doesn't do justice to a promising premise.</Review>
            <Review>The storytelling becomes muddled in the middle, and the suspense doesn't build as well as it ought to, but the winking undercurrent keeps the film watchable.</Review>
            <Review>What we have here is a horror movie with all the expected trimmings: Rumors of witchcraft. An isolated house way out in the middle of spooky woods where no one can hear you ... well, you know how that goes.</Review>
            <Review>Is the film savaging cable TV? Ethically challenged filmmakers? Found-footage horror itself? If the intent was to finish off this subgenre by exposing the rote mechanics behind it, the mission is only halfway accomplished.</Review>

            <Review>It makes some progress, but it unsurprisingly stalls where so many found footage films have failed before.</Review>

            <Review>A movie that is too silly to be so somber, and too somber to be much fun.</Review>
            <Review>The Hunger Games, which kicked off in a blaze of guts 'n' glory in 2012, ends now with a sad whimper, along with a lot of big bangs signifying nothing.</Review>
            <Review>Director Francis Lawrence stages the action sequences... with a modicum of flair, and Julianne Moore as rebel leader Coin gives off some sparks, but for the most part there is nothing divertingly new or different about this franchise fade-out.</Review>
            <Review>After the forced histrionics of Part 1, it's nice to see star Jennifer Lawrence being allowed to quiet down and act again. But the story still feels stretched, a countdown that slows as it approaches zero hour.</Review>
            <Review>This revenge plot animates Mockingjay Part 2 with a satisfying rage.</Review>
            <Review>Explosive, mostly true to the text, complex and chock full of action, "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2" should more than satisfy the franchise's many fans.</Review>
            <Review>iI's an enjoyable enough watch and if you've been with the series from the beginning you should go and see it to finish things off. But speaking as a fan of The Hunger Games, I don't see myself choosing to sit through it again any time soon.</Review>
            <Review>A movie of limited intrinsic merit, and about which it's difficult to make any positive claim for its quality stronger than that it's definitely better than Mockingjay Part 1.</Review>
            <Review>When it gets to its final stretch -- the one that nothing except books or Wikipedia or other movies can prepare you for -- Mockingjay Part 2 is well-prepared for what might strike non-fans (or even some actual fans) as anticlimax.</Review>
            <Review>It takes an actress of the calibre of Jennifer Lawrence to successfully convey The Hunger Games protagonist's existential conundrum.</Review>
            <Review>Holy heck is it good.</Review>
            <Review>For the past three falls, a new 'Hunger Games' movie has come around to remind us that so many of its elements - blockbuster franchise, YA novel adaptation, multiple films from one book - aren't inherently evil.</Review>

            <Review>One of the year's most unfairly invisible successes.</Review>
            <Review>A film that criticizes society and the way it focuses on vanity and other superfluous things. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>

            <Review>One will never wish to go through precisely what White does, but losing one's parents is inevitable, and the film is a searingly authentic portrait of the process.</Review>
            <Review>It's not easy viewing by any means. But it is strangely refreshing for a movie to show us that terminal illness involves agony and vomit and terror, despite what Beaches might have told us.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2015</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>88</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Tilda Swinton's hypnotic voiceover and a treasure trove of rare archival footage culled from hundreds of films from the 1880s through the 1930s-much of it previously unseen-combine to trace the anxieties of today's hyper-connected world back a hundred years. Then, too, electric media sparked idealism in the public imagination-hailed as the beginning of an era of total communication, annihilation of distance and the end of war. But then, too, fears over the erosion of privacy, security, morality proved to be well-founded. DREAMS REWIRED traces contemporary appetites and anxieties back to the birth of the telephone, television and cinema. At the time, early electric media were as revolutionary as social media are now. The technologies were expected to serve everyone, not just the elite classes. Human relationships would become stronger, efficiency would increase and the society would be revolutionized... But these initial promises were very different from what new media eventually brought to daily life. Using excerpts from early dramatic films, slapstick comedies, political newsreels, advertisements and recordings of scientific experiments culled during years of research in film archives around the world, co-directors Manu Luksch, Martin Reinhart and Thomas Tode unearth material that is by turns hilarious, revelatory, beautiful and prescient. The archival footage, combined with poetic narration and a virtuosic score by Siegfried Friedrich forges a cross-generational connection between contemporary viewers and their idealistic forbearers of a century ago.</StoryLine>

            <Review>It's a feast for fans of early film, but alas, the narration is inescapable.</Review>
            <Review>The ethereal essay provides a bounty of poetry, in the form of a measured narration by international treasure Tilda Swinton, and an extensively labored assembly of 200 black-and-white film clips.</Review>

            <Review>Dreams Rewired is a response to and a meditation upon the philosophy of our increasingly mediated world; privacy, anxiety, and power shifts are just snippets of the film's greater messages.</Review>

            <Review>Struggles aren't ignored here; they're just surmounted with patience and devotion. That may be a good strategy in life, but it can be static to watch on screen.</Review>
            <Review>A biopic about Mother Teresa could have easily been a self-important slog, yet William Riead's "The Letters" proves a stirring and absorbing if not quite definitive drama.</Review>
            <Review>This Mother Teresa biopic offers Hallmark Channel-grade inspiration of the most sluggish sort.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director William Riead offers a highly simplified version of his subject's life.</Review>
            <Review>Slow, clunky and not terribly informative.</Review>
            <Review>The film presents a meek and mild story which emphasises a cloying niceness, and even brings a rosy hue to the extreme suffering of the poor in India.</Review>
            <Review>A tale of two Mother Teresa's: On the brink of Vatican sainthood just announced, holy healer or 'hell's angel'? Expect an essentially nuance-free infomercial embrace of the former, despite ironic inklings of nun feminism challenging male church authority.</Review>
            <Review>It's refreshing to encounter the occasional movie character who is blessedly devoid of guile. For that matter, it's also a relief to attend a film where we're not expected to hiss and throw our popcorn at the screen the moment a Catholic priest appears.</Review>
            <Review>The movie's writing, direction and acting are not alone in blowing. Ciaran Hope's overwrought score sounds like a mashup of music from hokey old biblical pictures. If a duller, less inspired film hits the cineplex this season, it will be a miracle.</Review>
            <Review>A warts-and-all biopic which reveals Mother Teresa as a tortured soul who felt abandoned by the same God she served so selflessly.</Review>
            <Review>"The Letters" is a beautiful and deeply moving tribute to the self-sacrificing Mother Teresa.</Review>

            <Review>The flashily photographed enterprise too often becomes a blur of sound bites and slick aesthetics akin to a Nike commercial.</Review>
            <Review>For a story about incredibly focused determination - and if nothing else, Lance Armstrong had that - the film remains strangely uninvolved.</Review>
            <Review>"The Program" fails to add anything new, or penetrate the soul of so crafty a cheater.</Review>
            <Review>It never goes deep on what it was that produced the awfulness that is Lance Armstrong.</Review>
            <Review>"The Program," much to its detriment, concentrates almost exclusively on the history of the doping effort . There is no mention of his childhood or adolescence or any attempt to analyze his character.</Review>
            <Review>Foster nails Armstrong, right down to his final, clenched-jaw TV confession to Oprah Winfrey but The Program's glancing narrative feels less secure.</Review>
            <Review>Basically the same as The Armstrong Lie documentary but with less cycling scenes and the repulsive but appealing performance from Ben Foster.[Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>It's a shame Frears didn't fully approach the character and its subjects as expected. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>

            <Review>The movie needs the audacity of a "Trainspotting" to lift it above the norm.</Review>
            <Review>A dramatized real-life scandal of 1980s prep-school drug dealing plays like a tepid compilation of fictive cliches in The Preppie Connection.</Review>
            <Review>As written, Toby is somewhat of an empty slate, and Mann doesn't do much to fill in the blanks.</Review>
            <Review>This film fails even to evoke the '80s in costumes, soundtrack or other atmospherics.</Review>
            <Review>Nearly everything about "The Preppie Connection" - from the high-school class war to the flat, explanatory narration - has been cribbed from other, better films.</Review>
            <Review>Toby is so un-self-aware that his journey seems like mere obtuseness; what the film has to say about youthful degeneracy is less than zero.</Review>
            <Review>An edgy drama and an effective cautionary tale well worth seeing.</Review>
            <Review>[A] shallow and profoundly unexciting "true-life account" of one student's brief reign as a campus drug lord.</Review>
            <Review>Toby and co. come across as a pale, anti-intellectual imitation of the college-aged friends in Donna Tartt's The Secret History - a novel that explores the roots of its characters' moral recklessness rather than just chalking it up to teenage feelings.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2011</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>102</Duration>
        <StoryLine>In the 1980s, Victor DeNoble was a research scientist at a major tobacco company, where he was tasked with finding a substitute for nicotine that would not cause heart attacks. He succeeded- but in the process, he proved something that the industry had been denying for years: that cigarettes were addictive. He also uncovered a new addictive ingredient- setting off a chain of events that still reverberates even today.In a true act of modern-day heroism, DeNoble took his findings to the people despite a strict confidentiality agreement, eventually testifying about his research in the infamous 1994 Congressional hearings with the seven heads of the major tobacco companies. An unprecedented alliance of journalists, politicians, attorneys, and whistleblowers achieved what was once considered impossible- the first ever federal regulation of the tobacco industry, which continues to have repercussions even today. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>While it's satisfying to see fat cats tamed by science and an enraged public, the movie misses the opportunity to sustain the pressure.</Review>
            <Review>This straightforward documentary by Charles Evans Jr. is must viewing for anyone interested in public health and corporate ethics.</Review>
            <Review>Once it finds its footing in old-fashioned journalism, the film packs a wallop.</Review>
            <Review>"Addiction Incorporated" follows tobacco's journey downhill from respectability.</Review>
            <Review>Rather than relying only on archival footage and a parade of talking heads, Evans mixes it up with reenactments of episodes in the past. It's subtly unobtrusive and effective.</Review>
            <Review>While its thoroughness is laudable, its pacing is deadly. And the events and attitudes depicted already have become curiously passe in less than a decade.</Review>
            <Review>Addiction, Incorporated feels more like a well-made educational documentary rather than something you'd care to see in a theater.</Review>
            <Review>Anybody who's remotely interested in this topic already knows everything "Addiction Incorporated" has to say.</Review>
            <Review>Much of the first half of Charles Evans Jr.'s muckraking documentary is annoyingly gimmicky...</Review>
            <Review>...a film that should be shown in high schools and colleges. Victor DeNoble is a great role model with something important to say. I hope people listen.</Review>
            <Review>The one anti-smoking doc to see if you're only having one.</Review>
            <Review>Charles Evans, Jr. makes an impressive directorial debut... While entertainingly constructed, (the film) suffers at times from a too-comical approach.</Review>

            <Review>Is Sisters a good movie? No. No, it is not. Its plot manages to be both jarring (so many twists!) and predictable; its supporting characters are thin; it makes gleeful use of tired stereotypes.</Review>
            <Review>This hectic and sentimental comedy, though built on a firm foundation of familiar experience and stifled pain, is a sad waste of sparkling talent.</Review>
            <Review>As has so often been the case when it comes to Fey's movie choices, an opportunity has been lost.</Review>
            <Review>It's with no small reluctance I report Sisters is a depressing, overlong, repetitive slapstick disaster in which two of the most appealing stars around wallow in the muck AND the mire, figuratively and literally.</Review>
            <Review>Unfortunately, Sisters just isn't worthy of all the talent involved.</Review>
            <Review>You feel that there is a good and maybe even a meaningful comedy here. But it never gets its act together.</Review>
            <Review>Sisters really had me laughing out loud and it would be perfect for a girly cinema trip, but there's enough material there for the lads to be laughing along as well.</Review>
            <Review>A loose two hours, Sisters is not about anything large or important, it's just a hilarious film about the bonds of women who take care of their own lives despite copious outside pressures; just some little stuff like that.</Review>
            <Review>Parts of the film land perfectly; there's too much onscreen talent for that not to be the case.</Review>
            <Review>... if we're going to have one more dumb man-child comedy, at least this one has Tina Fey and Amy Poehler in it.</Review>
            <Review>Equally matched, incredibly likeable, and unflinching in their approach to this risky material, Sisters is worth seeing for the Fey and Poehler Show alone.</Review>
            <Review>'Sisters' is a Fey &amp; Poehler picture, a comedy vehicle designed to showcase the skills and personalities of its stars, and for the most part, it succeeds.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>This is a slender movie that Haynes gives plenty of antique atmosphere.</Review>
            <Review>Haynes taps into universal anxieties about love and relationships without ever letting go of the sense of imprisonment that came with being gay in the 1950s.</Review>
            <Review>Haynes maintains the film's temperature at a low simmer and expertly brings it to the boil, but while "Carol" builds to a scene of intense eroticism, it's mostly about all the things you can't reach out and touch.</Review>
            <Review>This is about two people who didn't know what their lives were until they met each other, then scrambling, in their muted, buttoned-up way, to figure out what happens next. Haynes loves them so much that he believes they can. You will too.</Review>
            <Review>As a love story this left me unsatisfied, though I enjoyed the lush period trappings and the flattering sense of how enlightened I am compared to people in the 1950s.</Review>
            <Review>The lesbian affair at its heart is rendered with intelligence and care, and if there are speeches to be made, they are happily few, and far more personal than political.</Review>
            <Review>A love story of sublime subtlety where the smallest encounters have the most consuming impact.</Review>
            <Review>Carol is a sensuous, enchanting piece of work which vividly and realistically recreates the 1950s in American in a new way -- never seeming twee or idealised.</Review>
            <Review>Carol tracks the slow-burn of romantic agony, with the added weight of a closet the size of the world.</Review>
            <Review>Never has the impossible glamour of Cate Blanchett been used to better effect than in Todd Hayne's ravishing and romantic Carol.</Review>
            <Review>A wondrously beautiful piece of filmmaking by American director Todd Haynes.</Review>
            <Review>Though it's certainly a two-woman show, Carol finds room to be impossibly generous to very nearly every human being who appears onscreen.</Review>

            <Review>Despite the movie's journalistic substance, the pleasure-free banality of its style gets in the way of a view of Jobs himself, whose work is as much aesthetic as it is industrial.</Review>
            <Review>Little here is new, but the archival footage is well chosen, the interviewees are illuminating, and Gibney, as usual, potently synthesizes what's out there.</Review>
            <Review>There is practically nothing in this film that was not already raked over in Walter Isaacson's 2013 biography or in the many thousands of articles about Jobs over the years. But there is something about seeing and hearing this story onscreen.</Review>
            <Review>"Steve Jobs: The Man in the Machine" is still wholly engrossing, especially in its first half, when it tells its thrilling creation stories.</Review>
            <Review>A complex portrait that gives as much weight to Jobs' world-changing talents as to his personal flaws.</Review>
            <Review>Brings home the complexities and contradictions of the man.</Review>
            <Review>An overlong but insightful documentary.</Review>
            <Review>A welcome (and, frankly, a bit overdue) corrective to the Jobs hagiography.</Review>
            <Review>Not only on a biographical account of Jobs, but also a look at the way in which big business and consumers at large engaged with the mythic personal narrative he fostered.</Review>
            <Review>Gibney is never able to join, or understand, the choir of millions singing the praises of Steve Jobs. Perhaps because of this, the documentary he has created seems a lot closer to the truth than anything else I've seen about Jobs.</Review>
            <Review>A chilling portrait of an icon who remains revered for spearheading so many technological innovations despite his general contempt for humanity and his utter lack of people skills.</Review>
            <Review>Whether or not you care about Apple products or Steve Jobs, Gibney's documentary offers a story well worth watching.</Review>

            <Review>Cinematic satisfaction is denied in Love 3D, an exercise in bedroom boredom by France's Gaspar Noé.</Review>
            <Review>Noé deserves credit for putting sex so boldly at the front and center of his new romance and depicting it as an essential part of love and life that's largely left off screen.</Review>
            <Review>Why so explicit? Because, Noe might reply, that's what love looks and feels like for a generation raised on porn, self-affirmation, and hookups.</Review>
            <Review>Noé seems unwilling to accept that art requires editing - it is, by definition, artifice. It demands the artist make choices, rather than try to cram an entire catalog of experiences down the viewer's throat.</Review>
            <Review>When "Love" works, Noé achieves a lulling, melancholic frenzy about sex and memory, but the foundation isn't strong enough to make his movie ever seem more than a stereoscopic fermata: one envelope-pushing note held way too long.</Review>
            <Review>A sincere but repetitive drone of a picture... "Love" feels deeply, but not complexly.</Review>
            <Review>It's too bad that the film's performance outside the bedroom is so unconvincing: the acting is dodgy, the storytelling is limp.</Review>
            <Review>This 3D sex movie is much more banal both visually and narratively than you'd expect.</Review>

        <StoryLine>From 1965 to 1970, musicians in New York City fused English and Spanish lyrics with Afro-Cuban, jazz, rock and R&amp;B rhythms and melodies to create Latin boogaloo. It was a period of revolution and social awakening and young Latinos in search of their identity, growing up in neighborhoods like East Harlem and the South Bronx, adopted Latin boogaloo as their soundtrack.</StoryLine>

            <Review>[Wächter is] a frightening example of how the denial common to fascist regimes can endure long afterward.</Review>
            <Review>What Our Fathers Did is a movie about historical and filial responsibility, about repudiation, about acceptance, about the pain we inherit, and the pain that continues to be doled out.</Review>
            <Review>The film is not just about a very specific and difficult conversation. Ultimately, it is also about the failure of conversation itself.</Review>
            <Review>What starts out as a genial documentary about two sons of high officials of the Nazi Party soon turns chilling in the gripping and compelling "What Our Fathers Did: A Nazi Legacy."</Review>
            <Review>A troubling study of denial, wartime responsibility and the challenge of dealing with a monster in the family.</Review>
            <Review>"What Our Fathers Did: A Nazi Legacy" wields a power that towers above many other small movies. It may not be the large definition of cinematic, but it is still a true film.</Review>
            <Review>What Our Fathers Did is a documentary with real intellectual heft, but there are very personal stakes involved.</Review>
            <Review>A fascinating doc about a couple sons of Nazi war criminals, one ashamed of his father's legacy, the other stubbornly proud.</Review>
            <Review>A valuable examination of personal responsibility v familial loyalty set against events that should never be taken for granted.</Review>
            <Review>What is it like to grow up as the son of a senior Nazi, with atrocities on your family conscience? In this powerful documentary, the British lawyer Philippe Sands meets two men living in the shadow of the Third Reich in very different ways.</Review>
            <Review>It entirely upends what I confess were my own preconceptions about what such a film would be: that is, a placid, consensual study, ruefully brooding on the sins of the fathers. This is far more challenging - and more disturbing.</Review>
            <Review>A horribly gripping film.</Review>

        <Duration>95</Duration>
        <StoryLine>A creative journey into the unique mind of Ren� Redzepi. How did Redzepi manage to revolutionize the entire world of gastronomy, inventing the alphabet and vocabulary that would infuse newfound pedigree to Nordic cuisine and establish a new edible world while radically changing the image of the modern chef? His story has the feel of a classic fairy tale: the ugly duckling transformed into a majestic swan, who now reigns over the realm of modern gourmet cuisine. But beneath the polished surface, cracks appear in the form of old wounds. 2013 stands as the worst year in Ren� Redzepi's career. We follow him as he fights his way back to the top, reinventing NOMA and reclaiming the title of best restaurant in the world in 2014 for the fourth time.</StoryLine>

            <Review>The end result is a revealing portrait of an artist wholly dedicated to his art.</Review>
            <Review>Less a documentary than a glittering souvenir, but it's still a record of a legend.</Review>
            <Review>I've never seen a restaurant documentary that seemed less interested in showing the joy of food.</Review>
            <Review>Deschamps never ventures below the surface of Redzepi's wildly successful experiment, and while the pictures are pretty, no one judges food on appearance alone.</Review>
            <Review>Foremost in this fly-on-the-wall report is the fascinating contradiction of Redzepi himself, whose abrasive perfectionism appears to be prompted by the prejudice he suffered in his youth after his family moved to Denmark from humble roots in Macedonia.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately this feels a bit too much like one long advertisement for the restaurant and misses an opportunity to develop a more probing thesis ...</Review>
            <Review>Redzepi's creations explode with color and are highly imaginative. His dishes seem less like food and more like a series of art installations.</Review>
            <Review>Any attempt to examine Redzepi's philosophy, much less interrogate the reasons for the restaurant's success (is it more than a fad or a gimmick?), is notably missing in action. In its place are pretty pictures of glistening leaves.</Review>
            <Review>Unfortunately, you learn more about his struggles, and his food, in multiple episodes of Anthony Bourdain's TV series No Reservations and The Mind of a Chef than you do in the 100 mostly flaccid minutes of Noma: My Perfect Storm.</Review>
            <Review>Food is not an inherently cinematic subject, being fundamentally about the sense of taste rather than that of sight. But, in its own terms, this doco isn't too bad at all.</Review>
            <Review>The film forgoes narration for a naturalistic style, putting viewers in the place they're most curious about -- the kitchen.</Review>
            <Review>Despite some mouth-watering shots of the presumably delicious menu items, the approach combines a strange mix of ingredients that isn't for all tastes.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>McKay cowrote The Big Short's screenplay with Charles Randolph, and they know how to keep an audience engaged, broadcasting this knowledge often, as both parody and indictment.</Review>
            <Review>It's funny because it's true. And it's tragic and frightening for the same reason.</Review>
            <Review>The Big Short is an angry, fiery movie disguised as a comedy.</Review>
            <Review>The Big Short manages to be as enlightening as it is entertaining. But its ominous revelations linger long after it's over.</Review>
            <Review>Thanks to Anchorman (2004) auteur Adam McKay's caustic comedy The Big Short, the events of the great economic meltdown of 2008 are beginning to make sense.</Review>
            <Review>It's an expertly calibrated entertainment, giving the actors room to play and reframing industry jargon as simple, elegant metaphors... And McKay orchestrates it all so deftly that you might not even notice how angry he is - or at least not right away.</Review>
            <Review>The Big Short is the best bet you'll make all year.</Review>
            <Review>McKay takes us deep into the world of mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations -- I sense your eyes glazing over -- but makes convoluted financial fraud feel as entertaining and zany as any of his previous comedies.</Review>
            <Review>Will it win Best Picture? Possibly. Will people still be talking about it in years to come? That, if you'll excuse the finance pun, you can bank on.</Review>
            <Review>I pray that this doesn't remain the best pop-economics explanation of what happened in 2007-'08, but for right now, it's what we've got, and it really could be a whole lot worse.</Review>
            <Review>Dramatically, it's a bit stilted and awkward, with uneven storytelling and a lack of real character development-but the film's performances, momentous editing, and prevailing attitude of sheer anger and frustration overshadow its lesser parts.</Review>
            <Review>Make an investment in "The Big Short." It's a sure thing!</Review>

            <Review>"Hyena Road" is a skillfully filmed reminder, if one is needed, about why Afghanistan earned its status as the "graveyard of empires."</Review>
            <Review>Gross ... is ultimately unable to satisfy the rules of dramatic engagement.</Review>
            <Review>Viewers are graced with a few disappointingly subdued action scenes, two humdrum romantic subplots, and a virtual museum of bad acting.</Review>
            <Review>The war story featuring good people making the best of a bad situation may feel very familiar, but it is a better kind of familiarity that also characterizes Hyena Road.</Review>
            <Review>The goal of the movie is truth-telling rather than flag-waving, but it also succeeds as impactful storytelling.</Review>
            <Review>Gross' script realistically depicts the uncertain and frequently shifting alliances that characterized the Afghan conflict's security situation.</Review>
            <Review>It's enjoyable enough on first watch, but it's unlikely you'll want to see it again.</Review>
            <Review>Gross manages to craft a feature that's horrifying and strangely inviting at the same time, delivering solid characterization to go with all the chaos.</Review>
            <Review>Hyena Road runs two hours long, but its entire narrative could be wedged into a half-hour documentary.</Review>
            <Review>The explosions are so wonderfully photographed; if only we actually cared about the characters exploding.</Review>

            <Review>Rendering the Red Baron-fighting Snoopy and way too many supporting characters in 3-D, and placing them in near-photo-realistic backgrounds, drains much of the charm from "The Peanuts Movie."</Review>
            <Review>In the figurative sense, though, the characters' sharp edges have been filed down.</Review>
            <Review>Somehow, this Peanuts feels familiar, even cozy. I can't make any great claims for it, but it feels like the return of an old friend.</Review>
            <Review>Without suffering, Peanuts becomes little more than wholesome distraction for kiddies.</Review>
            <Review>A terrific big-screen version that should satisfy Peanuts fans and generate new ones.</Review>
            <Review>There's something sad about seeing a character as sweet and simple as good ol' Charlie Brown so totally ruined.</Review>
            <Review>The Peanuts Movie is delightful from beginning to end and doesn't rely on baddies, silly sidekicks or lame toilet gags to distract your munchkins.</Review>
            <Review>A very good example of how to do modernisation right.</Review>
            <Review>The pacing is off at times and the gentle flow can occasionally lead the mind to wander, but it's a delight to have Peanuts back on the big screen.</Review>
            <Review>The little red-haired girl explains, that in the trying, she recognized Charlie Brown did kind, compassionate, truthful, and tolerant things. This is pure gold for children.</Review>
            <Review>Sure, it's less contemplative and less melancholy than the old strips, but there's more than enough nostalgia here to keep Peanuts nuts happy as well as younger viewers.</Review>
            <Review>If unabashed sweetness is your weakness then you will be completely helpless.</Review>

            <Review>We Come as Friends aims a cinéma vérité lens on a place where many promises are made, but few are kept.</Review>
            <Review>"We Come as Friends" has been beautifully filmed, with Sauper's God's-eye views of his plane's wing and the African landscape below resembling something Saint-Exupéry might have conjured.</Review>

            <Review>Sauper and his two-man crew fly over a land that's becoming as alien to its indigenous population as it was (and still is) to those who fancy exploiting it.</Review>
            <Review>Deeply unsettling and saddening, a brief glimpse of a tanned George Clooney only solidifying the tragedy. This is a pretty powerful work of non-fiction.</Review>
            <Review>Light on its feet yet dead-serious in tone, this excellent doc alternates micro to macro, ground to air.</Review>
            <Review>In case you thought that bad people weren't still doing bad things in Africa, Hubert Sauper's disturbing documentary We Come as Friends will disabuse you of that notion tout de suite.</Review>
            <Review>We Come As Friends, Hubert Sauper's teeming, Breughel-and-Bosch-pursuing documentary portrait of chaos after colonialism in battle-torn South Sudan is more eye-widening, surreal, sorrowful and anarchic than his earlier Darwin's Nightmare.</Review>

            <Review>Director Justin Kurzel seems to have set out to answer the question, "What if the supremely ambitious Thane of Glamis (played here by Michael Fassbender) was a druggie?"</Review>
            <Review>This screen adaptation of the famous Scottish play is very Scottish, very bloody and very clever, if inconsistently so.</Review>
            <Review>"MacBeth" is serious business indeed, and in the hands of director Justin Kurzel, it becomes bloody serious business. Very bloody serious business.</Review>
            <Review>All blood and ice, a stirring, unflinching retelling of Shakespeare's tale of a Scottish thane, his ambitious wife and a terrible deed that haunts them, leaving their hands forever stained.</Review>
            <Review>It stars Michael Fassbender as the murderous general of infamy and Marion Cotillard as his complicit wife. Two of the world's finest actors, they make a magnetic pair.</Review>
            <Review>The fundamental problem with this "Macbeth" is that it insists on reducing the mystery of motivation to the pop psychology of a magazine article.</Review>
            <Review>As far as justifying yet another version of "Macbeth" to the Brothers Weinstein goes, this ain't a half bad way to do it.</Review>
            <Review>What's especially stunning about this assured adaptation is that it's Kurzel's second feature, after the stomach-turning Snowtown.</Review>
            <Review>You've probably never seen The Scottish Play done quite like this.</Review>
            <Review>Too many witches spoil the psychological broth</Review>
            <Review>Kurzel goes back to the source. He gets mediaeval on you: The world of Macbeth is frontierland, a wild place cloaked in fog, mud and grass. Everything looks lived-in and worn out.</Review>
            <Review>Macbeth shows the director's fascination with the allure of power, violence and sadism, and how some relationships thrive (and then rapidly unravel) on a total absence of moral compunction.</Review>

            <Review>The movie features no music, and no words, yet some moments are so powerful and visceral that I still caught myself covering my ears.</Review>
            <Review>The Tribe revels in the distance it leaves between its audience and its characters, but in placing viewers on the outside, it also creates an experience that's almost perversely empathetic.</Review>
            <Review>This is a challenging film that's not for everyone. Yet there's no denying its brilliant concept and its raw cinematic power.</Review>
            <Review>There is nothing else like The Tribe, at once a searing, singular vision of a particular time and place and a brutal metaphor for the wounded human condition.</Review>
            <Review>If there's one place where love has no place, it's here.</Review>
            <Review>If "The Tribe" were set in the hearing world, its desolation would seem reductive and forced, a pose rather than a statement. Without words, the movie becomes a nihilistic fable and, indeed, something unheard of until now. It's silent opera.</Review>
            <Review>A radical film that won't leave anyone indifferent or unimpressed and will stay in your mind forever. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>The images created by Myroslav Slaboshpytskyi are so powerful that using actual words could break the illusion of the closed universe seen on screen. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>A difficult film, rich in scenes that might not be for those who are sensitive. The Tribe is made with confidence and an overwhelming strenght to create hells that are hard to forget. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>It would be a mistake to go along to this film unprepared - take note of that censor's warning. But it is a bold and brilliant work of great originality that will extend the horizons of even the most dedicated cineaste.</Review>
            <Review>Imagine Michael Haneke adapting Lord of the Flies and you might have some sense of its chilly compulsiveness. ... It's a film that, once experienced, can't be unseen.</Review>
            <Review>Slaboshpytskiy's film positions the viewer to recognise the astounding cinematography, the desolate setting and the compelling performances from a predominantly younger cast.</Review>

            <Review>If the conclusion is a little too sunny, that's a small flaw in an otherwise compelling film about the hazards of trying to buy emotional connection.</Review>
            <Review>As a memorable work of cinema, it misses every important mark by a mile.</Review>
            <Review>Gere, an actor capable of great nuance, hams it up so mightily you'd think the film was sponsored by Boar's Head.</Review>
            <Review>Fanning has little to do beyond grasping her prosthetic stomach, but James is a decent foil for Gere, who gives form to the highly topical subject of how pain meds destroy lives.</Review>
            <Review>The only good thing that makes this movie worth seeing it's Gere's performance. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Believe me when I say that not even a single scene in this film works. Gere is terrible here and the plot goes on and on to nowhere. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>

            <Review>High school itself is the nineteen-fifties of our imagination, always easier in our memories than it was in reality. With Grease, we can pretend we still want to go back.</Review>
            <Review>Even within the constrains of a live, televised event-which, let's be clear, Fox DOES know how to blow out, when it wants to-I couldn't help think that Grease: Live was just a dud.</Review>
            <Review>Fox raised the bar on TV musicals Sunday night with its ambitious, wildly energetic and mostly entertaining Grease: Live.</Review>
            <Review>Thanks to exceptional work from director Thomas Kail and several sterling supporting performances, much of Grease Live! was as sweet and tasty as a root beer float.</Review>
            <Review>This... was a show that was more about individual moments than about building a story.</Review>
            <Review>Regardless of its flaws, Grease is a reason to look forward to the next round of live musicals on TV.</Review>
            <Review>Thrilling live musical is fun, has iffy messages galore.</Review>
            <Review>If you hate musicals and hate Grease, Grease Live! sure wasn't going to change your mind all of the sudden. But for the multi-generational fanbase who admire this show, there was plenty to love about Grease Live!</Review>
            <Review>If Grease Live had more moments to work with like "There Are Worse Things I Could Do," it might have been truly special - but there was only so much it could do when the musical itself didn't have anything else to give.</Review>
            <Review>Grease: Live opted for a more cinematic approach, connecting the dots between the live-to-tape soap operas of the 1940s and the "live music videos" you see at contemporary MTV awards shows.</Review>
            <Review>The show successfully managed to combine all the nostalgic elements of Grease that everyone expected while creating a new experience.</Review>
            <Review>Despite its innovative direction and talented cast, Grease: Live fell victim to its bland source material - and equally bland leads - leaving it unable to truly top other iterations of the modern TV musical.</Review>

            <Review>Victoria is suspenseful and engagingly subversive, creating a surreal sense of anything-goes that takes place in the wee hours before dawn.</Review>
            <Review>What's really remarkable is how you'll forget this is a one-take wonder as the characters and story takes hold. Brilliantly engineered, coolly executed, Victoria is a triumph.</Review>
            <Review>Reminiscent of Michael Haneke's Funny Games in its sudden flare-ups of terror and horror, Victoria must be one of the great films of 2016.</Review>

            <Review>In Mountain Men, Labine and his cast achieve a hard-to-strike balance of comedy and heart-felt drama while maintaining a subtleness that respects your adult attention span.</Review>
            <Review>Tyler Labine carries a lot of the film against his straight man Crawford, like the grizzled spawn of Seth Rogen and Jack Black -- a jovial head in parkas and earflap toques.</Review>

            <Review>This is an audacious film about adolescent pains, sexual forces and hidden brutality. It puts Anucha on the official map of young Thai filmmakers to watch as well.</Review>
            <Review>An initially intriguing attempt to splice together a gay romance and a horror film that ultimately shows little flair for either genre.</Review>

            <Review>Warner Bros. would have been better off sticking with the film's original March release date and selling it as a horror movie.</Review>
            <Review>If you want a Ron Howard movie about a man obsessed with a creature from the deep, "In the Heart of the Sea," sadly, is not the place to start. Try "Splash."</Review>
            <Review>If a silent whale is your most magnetic screen presence, he should probably appear for more than a few minutes.</Review>
            <Review>There's a hollow at the heart of things, a strange decency and politeness for a film that strives to depict, in epic form, man's dark and visceral struggle with the world and himself.</Review>
            <Review>If the movie accomplishes nothing else, though, I hope it inspires the curious to actually sit down and finally read Moby-Dick.</Review>
            <Review>There's a lot of good actors in this movie, but they're given so little to do besides run around and shout in the midst of splashing waves.</Review>
            <Review>Apologies for the fishing analogy, but this is Oscar bait par excellence.</Review>
            <Review>In the Heart of the Sea is a big, top-notch adventure story with nothing to say, if that floats your perennial boat.</Review>
            <Review>It's sturdy, watchable, competently mounted, of course -- Howard is nothing if not a pro -- but except for the visuals, which can be quite stunning, it never roused me.</Review>
            <Review>It's not a monster-versus-man situation here, but a depiction of how a good chunk of human history was formed by men doing their darnedest to harvest energy from nature, to serve the needs of civilization and make a living for themselves.</Review>

            <Review>It's just not a very good movie, and much of the time, it seems like a colossal waste of McAvoy's considerable talents.</Review>

            <Review>"Break Point" looks good, and it has a big serve, but it's hard to love wholeheartedly.</Review>
            <Review>It's a mild-mannered film, strange considering the ferocious nature of tennis itself, the sport that supposedly holds "Break Point" together.</Review>
            <Review>The affable, shaggy-dog tennis comedy Break Point is bristly and charming, just like its star and producer, Jeremy Sisto, who plays the affable shaggy-dog Jimmy Price, a washed-up semi-pro tennis player.</Review>
            <Review>Always nice to enjoy a little comfort-food movie in which almost nothing surprising or particularly fresh happens, but we're happy to spend time with the characters and we wish them the best as the credits roll.</Review>
            <Review>It's the kind of amiable but predictable trifle that nobody ever seeks out, but that will mildly amuse everyone who happens to stumble onto it when it hits cable and the streaming services.</Review>
            <Review>Karas doesn't exactly reinvent the wheel as he puts this odd couple through the paces of getting in shape and reconciling old wounds, but he's helped by some laugh-out-loud quirk ...</Review>
            <Review>Break Point has its moments. It's passable, light entertainment, but ultimately comes up short when reaching for deeper comedic or dramatic flair.</Review>
            <Review>Break Point is light and bouncy, not unlike a tennis ball being lobbed back and forth. You always know where it's going, yet there's a distinct pleasure in the fast-paced way it gets there.</Review>
            <Review>As far as tennis comedies go, this one sits somewhere between WIMBLEDON and BALLS OUT. Make of that what you will.</Review>
            <Review>Break Point may not be a great film, but it certainly has a lot of heart. This is a sweet flick.</Review>
            <Review>Quietly moving comedy about tennis, brotherhood; language.</Review>
            <Review>There's just too much déja vu at play on this court.</Review>

            <Review>A bracing, stimulating and technically superb close-up look at the LA punk scene, pic is pitched at a perfect distance to allow for simultaneous engagement in the music and spectacle, and for rueful contemplation of what it all might mean.</Review>
            <Review>The interviews are mostly very funny, probably not always intentionally so. It's far from unmissable, but it's valuable rock history with some great noise.</Review>
            <Review>The Decline of Western Civilization' is a shrewd and engrossing documentary even for audiences who have absolutely no patience for the music it includes.</Review>
            <Review>[A] still potent 1981 documentary about Los Angeles punk rock.</Review>
            <Review>This is the first in a trilogy of rock documentaries made by Spheeris that, viewed today, seem like valuable cultural documents. But your granny won't like it.</Review>
            <Review>This often-fascinating slice of rock history wisely avoids high-profile punk groups, and instead opts for bands who are still struggling to pay their rent.</Review>
            <Review>This was the first time anyone had seen a mosh pit on-screen, and Spheeris somehow gets right in the scrum, capturing a blur of flailing bodies.</Review>
            <Review>Spheeris doesn't stand at the remove some documentarians do; you feel like you're in the scene, at those shows, and in those rooms.</Review>

            <Review>There's so little respect for the music that we never see or hear a number from beginning to end, and we rarely hear any of the musicians speak more than a few seconds at a time.</Review>
            <Review>For all the amusingly fatuous remarks heard here -- and Miss Spheeris has a great ear for these -- the overriding dimness of most of the fans and musicians is frightening.</Review>
            <Review>Rather like watching a car wreck on the opposite side of a motorway.</Review>
            <Review>The filmmaker ultimately comes away with a portrait of hedonism and emptiness that's as sad as it is funny.</Review>
            <Review>Fascinating.</Review>
            <Review>This is a well-made, observant documentary, with attitude to spare and plenty of justifiable laughs at the expense of its subjects.</Review>

            <Review>Both Pattinson and DeHaan could have used more to do, but both actors put in performances that elevate the proceedings.</Review>
            <Review>A moody, leisurely and occasionally frustrating piece of work ...</Review>
            <Review>The actors and their exchanges ring true, and by the time the film reaches its lonesome conclusion, the resonances are eerie.</Review>
            <Review>Dig, if you will, the pictures, but you don't need "Life" as a stargazing aid.</Review>
            <Review>I loved Ben Kingsley's over-the-top work as studio head Jack Warner, who in one scene explains the lay of the land to Mr. Dean in a manner that would inspire envy from Don Corleone. This guy isn't messing around.</Review>
            <Review>It ends up demystifying Dean, perhaps by accident but no less regrettably.</Review>
            <Review>It could have been crammed with dialogue and incident but, instead, there's lots of silence and understated subtlety.</Review>
            <Review>[Corbijn] elicits wonderful performances from DeHaan, Pattinson and also Ben Kingsley, who steals every scene as studio boss Jack Warner.</Review>
            <Review>DeHaan captures Dean's essence impressively, while Pattinson delivers his best work since David Cronenberg's Cosmopolis.</Review>
            <Review>Life turned out to be as bland as its title.</Review>
            <Review>For Dean aficionados, this is a wonderful way to get the backstory on some of the most iconic images we have of the star.</Review>
            <Review>As the film's emotional anchor, Stock isn't nearly as fascinating by comparison.</Review>

            <Review>Seth Rogen bursts with inventive exuberance in this schematic but genial holiday comedy about millennials settling down.</Review>
            <Review>A lazy and not very funny stoner comedy.</Review>
            <Review>A smartly built, chemically-enhanced Christmas story about growing up that you can't watch with the grown-ups - at least, not the ones who will get bothered by dick pics.</Review>
            <Review>A finely tuned comedy machine, a film that not only works as a standalone contemporary project, but one that will come to be viewed in five, 10, 15 years as a snapshot of industry players at their prime, and a handy guide to before-they-were-famous icons.</Review>
            <Review>When we were first introduced to Rogen in "Knocked Up," there was some novelty to a story about a dopey slacker who learns some family values. But "The Night Before" is just dutifully following a template.</Review>
            <Review>A raucous and refreshing new take on the Christmas movie.</Review>
            <Review>Although sprinkled with some good scenes, The Night Before falls short of bridging the gap between adult humor and family Christmas comedies.</Review>
            <Review>The movie's trump card is the undeniable chemistry between all three leads, with Rogen in particular milking his hung-dog comic delivery for all it's worth.</Review>
            <Review>Watching these nitwits work out their issues and fumble their way through their evening is good fun, even when it gets gross.</Review>
            <Review>The Night Before doesn't touch the director's best, but it's fun, and it's a little silly, and with all of its references to other holiday films, could become a must see for the season.</Review>
            <Review>The people who made the trailers for 'The Night Before' seem to have a better idea of what it should be than the people who made the movie.</Review>

            <Review>What Maddin &amp; Co. have invented here ranges from Freudian horror to childish naughtiness.</Review>
            <Review>Guy Maddin delivers another of his wild and whimsical fantasies, tinged with camp and couched in the film grammar of silent cinema.</Review>
            <Review>Enjoying this film will depend on your state of mind. Indeed, "The Forbidden Room" is a state of mind unto itself.</Review>
            <Review>Maddin's singular brand of cinematic reinvention goes a little over the top.</Review>
            <Review>[A] narcotized fever dream ...</Review>
            <Review>The film is more than just spot-on parody.</Review>
            <Review>Canadian iconoclast Guy Maddin has been making strange, surreal films that evoke the images and storytelling traditions of silent movies for decades. The Forbidden Room (2015)... is like a compendium of his obsessions and cinematic fetishes.</Review>
            <Review>The bad part is that at over two hours long the film is not that good.</Review>
            <Review>Whilst The Forbidden Room is overlong and messy, it is still a lightning bolt of creativity from one of the most enigmatic and compelling filmmakers working today.</Review>
            <Review>Dense and lacking the playful quality of his more straightforward work, this represents a new multi-narrative direction for Maddin.</Review>
            <Review>There's a strange comfort in knowing that Freud's fascinating topography of the mind will never be completely discredited while Maddin is making deliriously absurd movies.</Review>
            <Review>An exhausting and overwhelming film to experience, but there's also something exhilarating about its mad energy and boundless invention.</Review>

            <Review>There is little that is worse than satire that tiptoes around its subject, as if risking offense were a sin.</Review>
            <Review>The film employs and immediately squanders the talents of legitimate comedy all-stars Amy Ryan, Danny McBride, Jemaine Clement and Will Forte.</Review>
            <Review>Even with the likes of Amy Ryan and Will Forte providing capable backup, it all grows ancient, fast.</Review>
            <Review>There is a redemptive message in Verdean's eventual downfall but it's mostly lost in a storyline that tries way too hard to be outlandish.</Review>
            <Review>There is an absence of meanness in the Hesses' comic worldview that makes their films almost impossible to dislike.</Review>
            <Review>Should have been broader, should have been funnier. Did they lose their nerve?</Review>
            <Review>There are some scattered laughs, but considering its broad targets, the film is too detached from reality to consistently hit the mark.</Review>
            <Review>"Don Verdean" could be more sharp, more focused, and it's easy to be disappointed by the film's low ambitions.</Review>
            <Review>Don Verdean may only appeal to hardcore Hess fans-anyone else will likely never once crack even a smile.</Review>
            <Review>A poor attempt to spoof evangelicals and their mindless, desperate followers.</Review>
            <Review>Don Verdean is the sort of comedy which presumes its own hilarity long before it gets around to telling any actual jokes, or staging anything that might otherwise be considered funny...</Review>

            <Review>Anyone hoping the franchise might open out into new thematic territory will be disappointed; this is the same old ritual, from the amped-up training sequences to the climactic title fight with its absurd number of punches landed in every round.</Review>
            <Review>It's an invigorating piece of nostalgia that fuels a bigger adrenaline rush with its climax than any big-budget blockbuster could provide.</Review>
            <Review>Coogler keeps everything moving so gracefully that by the end of Creed, we almost don't know what hit us.</Review>
            <Review>Whether the credit goes to the director or the actor or both, this is the performance of Stallone's career, one in which that age-defying orange body stays covered up but his sadness is in full view.</Review>
            <Review>The film is full of life and loose humor, and Creed often transcends the genre by playing with movie mythology.</Review>
            <Review>Hot damn! Fruitvale Station director Coogler, 29, turbocharges the Rocky franchise. Jordan is stellar. And so irresistible is Stallone's blend of tough and tender that Oscar should give him points. Yo, Academy!</Review>
            <Review>Creed is a special film that pound for pound competes with the best heartstring-pulling of Rocky Balboa's 40-year screen odyssey but, crucially, looks to what's ahead in a very exciting way.</Review>
            <Review>Simply put, Creed is a total triumph.</Review>
            <Review>Creed is feels gritty and lived in, while also hitting technical highs like an astonishing single-take boxing match. It's funny and sweet and sad and scrappy. You never saw this one coming.</Review>
            <Review>It's a formula film, executed to near perfection. And it wields a secret weapon: our nostalgia for the original.</Review>
            <Review>Creed stands tall as one of the most entertaining sports films we've seen in years; a scintillating and, occasionally, moving piece with genuine heart, energy, depth and humour. Oh, and the fight scenes are brilliant.</Review>
            <Review>Sure, this being Philly there's fair dollop of cheese with that steak. But Creed still packs a surprising punch.</Review>

            <Review>Taxi is easily the director's most accessible work to date.</Review>
            <Review>Jafar Panahi's Taxi looks onto a world where the social order and the spiritual order are at odds, in flux, where the conversations are sometimes cutting, sometimes comic, sometimes troubled, sometimes profound.</Review>
            <Review>Panahi looks for new perspectives everywhere he goes, and this search reflects his unwavering devotion to cinema, which has the power to transmit those perspectives to the world.</Review>
            <Review>Those who've followed Panahi's career over the decades will catch echoes of and references to his earlier movies, and at times "Taxi" is as much a tour of his filmography as it is of Tehran.</Review>
            <Review>This is a movie that you will admire both for its courage and creativity.</Review>

            <Review>Helgeland uses long-take shots through boisterous clubs, unreliable narration and splashes of violence to create a drama of little surprise and even less impact.</Review>
            <Review>Legend seems like a movie Scorsese might have made if he wasn't paying attention - the elements are present but they are clumsily assembled and the outcome underwhelms.</Review>
            <Review>It's not short of thrills, the biggest of which is Hardy's double performance.</Review>
            <Review>Watching Tom Hardy nearly upstage himself in the gangster biopic Legend makes for mesmerizing viewing. It's also an object lesson in how great acting can transcend a film's limitations.</Review>
            <Review>The movie's a testament to the Krays' ability to get away with everything - for a while, anyway. But it's better evidence of Tom Hardy's ability to do just about anything.</Review>
            <Review>Hardy's performance - nay, performances - are so electrifying they cut through the confusion. Watch "Legend" for him and him alone. He's great, times two.</Review>
            <Review>Tom Hardy shines in "Legend" -- twice, in fact -- but his satisfying dual performance is the *only* thing Brian Helgeland's film has going for it.</Review>
            <Review>Legend is the best movie of the year if your idea of a great movie is watching one of our preeminent actors hamming it up for two hours and change in service of a lacking story.</Review>
            <Review>An alarming botch of a biopic on top of being an all-round cheesy gangster movie.</Review>
            <Review>This would almost be entirely all about surfaces if not for Hardy's portrayal of the brothers.</Review>
            <Review>Lesser characters are caricatures - Eccleston as a dogged detective is particularly ill-used - and the film as a whole is all over the place, tonally and narratively. It's as if no one's sure whether it's a comedy, farce or tragedy.</Review>
            <Review>Helgeland's film falls way short compared to Peter Medak's 1990 film The Krays, which elevated their story to an almost poetic level. Next to it, Legend feels like a cartoon.</Review>

            <Review>Only when the camera is on Vikander does the film transcend its artifice. In one of the year's best performances, she imbues Gerda with such poignancy and grace that Redmayne all but fades into the background.</Review>
            <Review>Eventually, [Hooper] surrenders to the visual and psychological displays attendant on Redmayne's prolonged transformation from Einar to Lili.</Review>
            <Review>A sweet and inoffensive drama located in a pretty art deco past that makes the experience of transgender people palatable to a mainstream audience.</Review>
            <Review>Although handsomely made and admirably performed, The Danish Girl doesn't quite become the emotionally powerfully and socially important picture it clearly hoped to be.</Review>
            <Review>[Redmayne] emanates an emotional urgency in Lili with a potent mix of confusion, pain and longing that oozes from his every mannerism.</Review>
            <Review>Vikander's performance in the role is both flawless and inspirational. Just give her the Oscar now.</Review>
            <Review>A somewhat pedestrian and heavily sanitized take on an incredibly interesting, unconventional relationship.</Review>
            <Review>The film elects to make both characters so very much less interesting than their real-life counterparts.</Review>
            <Review>Tom Hooper presents a pretty picture and repeats the same theme over and over. Redmayne kind of does the same thing as well, so the film falls squarely on Vikander's shoulders.</Review>

        <StoryLine>In the summer of 1989, the Mt. Vista motel has been slowly deteriorating on an isolated roadside, and its proprietor, John Henley, is not faring much better. Since his wife left him and their nine year-old son, Ted, John has drifted into despondency. With no parental or adult supervision to guide him, the young Ted's darker impulses begin to emerge, leading him to explore a growing fascination with death. This fascination blossoms into a bizarre and dangerous method for roping in the occasional passing motorists for an unplanned overnight stop at the motel. When a mysterious drifter is forced to take up residency at the Mt. Vista for several days, he and Ted forge a unique friendship that sends the boy down a dangerous path.</StoryLine>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>Mr. Macneill and his co-screenwriter, Clay McLeod Chapman, have developed a feature stunning to behold if somewhat unpersuasive in narrative.</Review>
            <Review>The film feels overly long, and while lingering shots of the mountain scenery do help convey the isolation of the deserted motel, too many of them feel repetitive.</Review>
            <Review>While the score goes out of its way to make his every action feel sinister, the picture doesn't fulfill its horrific potential until the third act.</Review>
            <Review>While it's admirable that director Macneill and his co-scripter Clay McLeod Chapman opted to emphasize mood and psychology over the story's more exploitable elements, it nonetheless results in a listless tedium.</Review>
            <Review>The scariest aspect of "The Boy" is the extent to which Macneill makes it possible to sympathize with the troubled protagonist -- even as its haunting final shot hints at the horrors yet to come.</Review>
            <Review>A 9-year-old sociopath stubbornly fails to become scary in this stillborn thriller.</Review>
            <Review>A thoughtful story that is as touching as it is unnerving, The Boy is an unflinching &amp; powerfully poetic examination of the human psyche that never passes judgment on its titular character, even after he's unleashed his inner lunatic on the world.</Review>
            <Review>An austere and chilling portrait of America's abandoned margins, The Boy is a slow-burner that builds and builds to its climactic conflagration, and offers a dark, disturbing flipside to Richard Linklater's Boyhood (2014).</Review>
            <Review>It succeeds in conveying the dark edge of an effective thriller, but it lacks the human sentiment -- the poignancy, the devastation -- that would've made it soar above less heady genre fare.</Review>
            <Review>It makes no bones about the fact that there is something critically broken in Ted. The question for the audience is whether it is nature, nurture, or a mixture of both.</Review>
            <Review>Not since Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer has a movie gotten inside the head of a killer with such cold-blooded artistry.</Review>
            <Review>The Boy is a title that makes this movie sound innocuous. A more fitting header would be Portrait of the Serial Killer as a Young Boy.</Review>

            <Review>There's a tough-minded drama struggling to break through the movie's glossy veneer-a contemplation of the black hole of death that, sooner or later, becomes the center of life.</Review>
            <Review>Is this really an honest portrait of a beautiful and intense friendship between women? What's intense about it, or beautiful, or honest?</Review>
            <Review>In the march to the end, "Miss You Already" grinds its gears through the late stages of cancer, following a predictable and cliche path. Each scene is a yank on the heartstrings, a poke in the tear ducts, its intents and machinations plainly obvious.</Review>
            <Review>It observes, rather astutely, that there is a power imbalance in a certain kind of friendship where one half plays the ringleader and scene-stealer while the other is the sidekick and enabler.</Review>
            <Review>Part-"Cake," part-"50/50" and a whole lot of "Beaches" ...</Review>
            <Review>The film is a soulless parade of movie conventions and rote acting.</Review>
            <Review>You can see it all coming, but it's wonderful.</Review>
            <Review>Miss You Already is a small step up from a TV disease-movie-of-the-week, due purely to the forceful performance of Toni Collette as Millie, a successful PR executive with a hip musician husband and young kids who discovers she has breast cancer.</Review>
            <Review>Milly is no saint, but she grows on you.</Review>
            <Review>By the end, even the hardest of hearts will find it difficult to hold back the tears.</Review>
            <Review>Miss You Already recontextualizes beats of the cancer movie sub-genre into a story about the bulletproof power of female friendship.</Review>
            <Review>Barrymore and Collette bring their 'A' game, while Hardwicke's stewardship is gloriously strong.</Review>

            <Review>It's rather hard to feel wholly sympathetic towards the quixotic bullfighter who at one point declares, "I've never had a relationship, even with a woman, as intimate as the one I have with a bull."</Review>

            <Review>Sumptuous, sincere and built on aging bones, "Youth" is a wonder of a film, a look back at life's sprawling possibilities, dark corners and aspirations.</Review>
            <Review>Age is more than just a number, Youth tells us. What really matters, though, is whether you're going to let that number define you.</Review>
            <Review>Watching Youth, you'd swear Fellini had risen from his grave and returned to make another movie.</Review>
            <Review>Youth is a meditation on aging, on friendship, on love, loss, wisdom, disillusionment, pain.</Review>
            <Review>There is little life here. Only artifice. And some howlingly awful dialogue.</Review>
            <Review>Absolutely beautiful and sometimes maddening while never offering easy answers.</Review>
            <Review>A sometimes Felliniesque exercise in irksome pretension and confounding indulgence grounded by two tremendous performances and somehow, despite itself, offering flashes of profound loveliness.</Review>
            <Review>Here gorgeous visuals and great music - no spoilers - do wonders for eyes and ears while Caine and his co-stars prove the best of visitors to both head and heart.</Review>
            <Review>Caine, Keitel, Weisz, Dano, [and] Fonda all deliver their characters with aplomb.</Review>
            <Review>It's cinema-as-drug, and while there is certainly a human dimension underlying this, the film's raw pleasure as a surface-level object doesn't necessarily insist on our doing that much digging.</Review>
            <Review>There's much to like about Youth: It's charming and funny, with some strong performances from the ensemble cast. Yet Sorrentino's eagerness to elicit swoons from the audience can feel a bit too calculated at times.</Review>
            <Review>Two great veteran actors from either side of the Atlantic do their best with frustratingly uneven material.</Review>

            <Review>A strong, if not genre-changing, feature debut for actor-turned-writer/director Justin Trefgarne.</Review>
            <Review>It's obvious a lot of care, time and creative passion went into it. It's a relatively low budget project that does a great job pretending it's not. But behind the aesthetics, there isn't much else.</Review>
            <Review>This doesn't come together, but Trefgarne has clearly got talent.</Review>

            <Review>It's a deeply satisfying, profoundly moving adaptation of a popular novel, an all-too-rare occurrence in modern Hollywood.</Review>
            <Review>Room is astonishing: It transmutes a lurid, true-crime situation into a fairy tale in which fairy tales are a source of survival.</Review>
            <Review>Room is a good movie with a great performance at its core. Larson's career was already going places... But Room will be remembered as the movie that etched her permanent place on the map.</Review>
            <Review>Arresting and heartbreaking, wrought with extremes of tension and love, Room is as evocative and unforgettable on screen as in the bestselling novel that inspired it.</Review>
            <Review>This dramatic thriller is small-scale but profound, with great performances from Larson and a young Tremblay.</Review>
            <Review>[A] very moving portrait of motherhood, hope and determination, a brilliantly made film about the fight and right to freedom and the beauty of life.</Review>

            <Review>Room still manages to be strangely uplifting, and there is light and warmth beyond the darkness if you can bear to hold on that long.</Review>

            <Review>even at a mere 80 minutes, this feature feels padded and overlong - and the ingenious way that the writer/director contrives to stage events before Emma's various devices also sadly palls through repetition. In short, needs more slashing.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Xu Lai had dreams once. To be an artist and marry the girl of his dreams. 15 years later, he's sick of designing bras, humoring his baby-crazy wife, and catering to loopy in-laws. But his upcoming family vacation, now including his DVD-pirating, aspiring-documentarian brother-in-law, has a hidden agenda: a chance meetup with his old flame. But ditching his clan for a clandestine hookup might be the least of his worries. There's been a murder, and his new hot pursuit might be from the cops who want a word with him.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Perhaps because it tries too hard to be too many things, the movie loses its punch.</Review>
            <Review>Whereas "Lost in Thailand" felt like a homage to Stephen Chow's brand of slapstick, "Lost in Hong Kong" looks to be an all-encompassing love letter to Hong Kong filmmaking.</Review>
            <Review>Apart from letting audiences play spot-the-Wong-Kar-Wai-reference, the movie also puts viewers in the mood for Cantopop.</Review>
            <Review>A full-on homage to the best of Hong Kong pop culture from the 1980s and '90s.</Review>

        <Title>A Country Called Home</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2016</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>90</Duration>
        <StoryLine>A COUNTRY CALLED HOME tells the story of Ellie (Imogen Poots), a young woman living in Los Angeles who learns that her estranged alcoholic father has died. Having had no contact with him since childhood, she's reluctant to make the effort to attend his funeral, but something draws her to the dusty corner of Texas where he spent the last years of his life. At first dismayed by the small town vibe, she's soon intrigued by the people she meets, among them a distraught stepmother, her apprehensive son, a gutsy young musician, and a set of doting grandparents she's never met. As she finds glimpses of the father she once knew, she also discovers a new attitude towards friendship, loyalty, and family.</StoryLine>

            <Review>The gentle drama A Country Called Home is in sync with its small-town Texas setting. Unfortunately, much of it is also as flat as the terrain, despite the efforts of an engaging cast led by Imogen Poots.</Review>
            <Review>It's refreshing to see Poots in a role such as this, one that lets her easygoing charm shine through.</Review>
            <Review>The third act in particular becomes an awkward mixture of broad comedy and pathos.</Review>
            <Review>There's exactly one fascinating, original character in Anna Axster's well-meaning but bland debut feature, "A Country Called Home." Unfortunately, the movie's not about him.</Review>
            <Review>A Country Called Home never goes all-in on the implied cornpone of its title-but it never really goes all-in on anything else, either.</Review>
            <Review>There is not a lot in the plot that is surprising or even original. There is some wit and there is a not too unrealistic look at strained family relationships.</Review>
            <Review>A Country Called Home is a decent enough trip through the back roads of Texas, connecting with a partly dysfunctional family. It's just not something that most viewers will want to write home about.</Review>
            <Review>While I found it sincere, I felt like it meandered too much and suffered from anxiety over what kind of a film it wanted to be.</Review>
            <Review>The rigorously dull A Country Called Home hates flyover country more than Bill Maher.</Review>
            <Review>Lacks the clear vision to know how to distinguish itself from a hundred other similar movies.</Review>
            <Review>There's heart here for the taking, but Axster turns a complicated domestic and emotional crisis into an episode of a network television drama.</Review>
            <Review>Sturdy, well-acted, but a mostly dull and unsurprising "You can't go home" melodrama.</Review>

            <Review>An efficiently engineered suspenser, with solid performances and a tight pace.</Review>
            <Review>The result is a promising film that leaves a bad taste in your mouth, like a meal well-presented on the plate that just doesn't fill you up.</Review>
            <Review>The actors alone can't sustain "Intruders" for its full 90 minutes, but for the most part they follow Starr's lead, carrying a film that's both menacing and magnetic.</Review>
            <Review>"Intruders," a distasteful thriller with a bludgeoning sensibility and little common sense, turns a cozy family home into a clockwork house of horrors.</Review>
            <Review>Intruders ultimately comes across like basic-cable schlock (or is it Netflix schlock now?), slightly redeemed by the germ of a great idea, even if said idea never truly germinates.</Review>
            <Review>Like the house, the movie is something of a shifting puzzle box; if only the backstory that turns its gears weren't so rotten.</Review>
            <Review>[director] Schindler plays these cat-and-mouse tropes expertly, as hunter and hunted repeatedly swap roles - but Schindler proves equally adept at playing our initial sympathies with Anna off against our escalating moral unease.</Review>
            <Review>[W]hat Intruders lacks most is a sense of a personal touch, and as a result, the film's original reversal of home invasion genre is lost in the blandness of its' presentation.</Review>
            <Review>Intruders at least tries to do something different, and it does manage to keep things ticking over smoothly enough.</Review>
            <Review>The film doesn't know if it wants to be an over-the-top, sensationalized shocker with cartoonishly evil villains... or a more realistic, gritty thriller with human characters, and the end result lies in a muddied, thrill-less, exasperating middle ground.</Review>
            <Review>A highly competent, suspenseful, and fun thriller that never overstays its welcome. Do it a favor, and open the door.</Review>
            <Review>Well-acted and initially suspenseful before it turns increasingly implausible, lazy and uninspired as it piles on the twists in unsatisfying ways.</Review>

            <Review>You may find "Sunshine Superman" exhilarating or you may find "Sunshine Superman" terrifying, but you almost surely will not find it boring.</Review>
            <Review>Engrossing, tension-filled and utterly fascinating.</Review>
            <Review>While the doc takes a conventional and even pedestrian approach -- with multiple talking-head interviews and some re-enactments with actors -- there is also plenty of spectacular archival footage showing jumps dating back to the 1960s.</Review>
            <Review>[A] spectacular and affecting portrait.</Review>
            <Review>Long before there were GoPros, there was Boenish, a camera mounted on his helmet, jumping from Yosemite's El Capitan or L.A. skyscrapers under construction.</Review>
            <Review>Boenish's wife, Jean, who trained to jump with him, is interviewed extensively, and, although Strauch doesn't provide much backstory for her, she emerges as that rarity -- a perfect matchup to a seemingly unmatchable man.</Review>
            <Review>Sunshine Superman is a touch long, and at times pedestrian but it's still a moving, thrilling story.</Review>
            <Review>Ever watched an extreme sports enthusiast leap off a mountain to his death? No? Then you haven't seen this bittersweet biopic about a compulsive base jumper with a death wish.</Review>
            <Review>This documentary about Carl Boenish, founder of modern BASE jumping is a captivating portrait of a man unlike any other. Not just an adrenaline junkie, but a superb cinematographer, technical wizard, philosopher, filmmaker and promoter of his sport.</Review>
            <Review>This is still a wonderful portrait of a man who chose to embrace life to its fullest whilst biting his thumb at gravity.</Review>
            <Review>Heart-stopping cliff-jumping doc.</Review>

            <Review>The real Noble accomplished a lot, but the movie insists on giving her achievements a mystical and mythical dimension ... without the imagination to carry it off.</Review>
            <Review>Inspirational true story features many mature themes.</Review>
            <Review>Although the script wavers on occasion overall the film works very well, it feels emotionally honest and is a fitting tribute to a woman it's impossible not to admire.</Review>
            <Review>It's like watching two films instead of one and the script resorts too often to a narrative shorthand, delivering 10-second scenes that seem to belong in a trailer.</Review>
            <Review>Bradley has structured the tale well, as when we do move between eras, it's done so in a seamless manner and with a minimum contrivance.</Review>
            <Review>Often desperately sad but ultimately triumphant, Noble is a sincere and well-executed portrayal of good triumphing over evil.</Review>
            <Review>Noble is a solid straight-faced biopic that is raised to surprising heights by a flinty central performance from the redoubtable Deirdre O'Kane.</Review>

        <Title>King Georges</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2016</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>78</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Philadelphia, circa 2010, is about to lose its culinary treasure: Le Bec-Fin, one of the finest French restaurants in the country. The 67-year-old owner, Georges Perrier, nearly as iconic as his landmark eatery, is preparing to sell the restaurant after more than four decades in business. Filmmaker Erika Frankel, a native of the Philly suburbs, asks if she could film Perrier as an era-ending tribute. Perrier, however, has other plans. He decides to withdraw the sale and reinvent Le Bec-Fin by hiring a new prot�g�, Chef Nicholas Elmi, who achieved national fame on the "Top Chef" TV show. Perrier wants to pass the business to Elmi, but finds he has trouble letting go of the spatula. Over a three-year period, Frankel captures this mercurial, passionate, quixotic force of nature as he struggles to preserve his sumptuous Gallic dishes in an era where casual attitudes and lighter fare are taking hold. Spiced with archival footage and interviews from world-renowned chefs, such as Thomas Keller, Daniel Boulud, and Eric Ripert, King Georges is a feast for the eyes, as well as a touching portrait of a master artist in the twilight of his career who realizes he is still hungry for seconds.</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>Forbidden passion blazes between a brother and sister in this sexually delirious, rock 'n' roll romance. Working from a script originally written for Fran�ois Truffaut, boundary-pushing director Val�rie Donzelli spins a deliciously dark adult fairy tale in which the relationship between aristocratic siblings Marguerite (Anais Demoustier) and Julien (Jeremie Elkaim) goes from playfully flirtatious to passionately erotic-an affair that tests the limits of what society will accept. A provocative fable about what we're willing to risk for love,Marguerite &amp; Julien is a one-of-a-kind romance that transcends time, reason, and moral boundaries</StoryLine>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>An overheated but haunting, strangely involving tale inspired by the doomed romance between real-life aristocratic French siblings circa 1600.</Review>
            <Review>The excruciating experience of "Marguerite &amp; Julien" need only be endured by viewers with an obsessive interest in the least constructive aesthetic currents in contemporary French cinema.</Review>
            <Review>The wan narrative at hand fails on several levels, including an annoying amount of intentional anachronistic details that detract rather enhance.</Review>
            <Review>Marguerite &amp; Julien's romance is a non-item, but Donzelli sprinkles it with faux naiveté, which has the aftertaste of an artificial sweetener. Who would ever want to see this movie?</Review>
            <Review>The widescreen intimacy of small moments - the flush of a rain-soaked cheek - humanizes Donzelli's grand folly and the couple who challenge the parameters of morality.</Review>
            <Review>For a premise as provocative as an incestuous French fairy tale, this sort of toothlessness is tantamount to a death knell.</Review>
            <Review>It finds its filmmaker completely lost between impulses to pay homage, play it safe, or offer something--anything--new.</Review>
            <Review>Valérie Donzelli's new costume drama is set in multiple time frames. Gorgeous and passionate, I wanted to love it. But the meta-exercise has no follow-through, so ultimately it becomes more confusing than engaging.</Review>

            <Review>Silverman delivers a knockout performance - any memories of her scatalogical stand-up act are washed away in an instant. But her intense commitment to the depths of depression belongs in a better, more focused, less derivative film.</Review>
            <Review>I Smile Back isn't a candy-coated, noble depiction of addiction and the toll it takes on families, but rather a bleak yet honest look at how regular people lose themselves, and how difficult it can be to find the way back.</Review>
            <Review>I Smile Back pummels with nastiness, then moves from one shocking event to the next without a backward glance.</Review>
            <Review>Silverman's performance, while good, is by no means great, and she is not able to transcend what amounts to a little too much sweetness and light in this cinematic "Smile."</Review>
            <Review>Silverman is far and away the best part of "I Smile Back," a strained entry in the Mad Housewife genre.</Review>
            <Review>A tough, unbending, sometimes brutally truthful profile of one woman's addiction and the havoc it wreaks on herself and just about everyone who matters to her.</Review>
            <Review>Silverman is excellent, but she could use a better script.</Review>
            <Review>'I Smile Back' could very well be just another addiction drama, were it not for the power and force of Silverman's performance, which she plays with such raw openness that she transcends the material.</Review>
            <Review>At a running time of 85 minutes, we learn too little about Laney and too much about her addiction.</Review>
            <Review>It would be nice if this film offered more hope for Laney, but it isn't that kind of film. It is just a slice of life, and a pretty depressing slice at that, with a disturbing beginning, a dismal end and false hope in the middle.</Review>
            <Review>The sort of reductionism one finds in cautionary videos made for schools, with equally weak logic.</Review>
            <Review>It is a brave performance by Sarah Silverman as a woman slipping into a private hell of her own making, but - well, that probably says enough.</Review>

            <Review>With very few exceptions the risk pays off and Frankenstein manages to be smart and engrossing. However, because of the sharp execution of this well-thought-out retelling, when flaws do arise they are impossible to ignore.</Review>
            <Review>Bernard Rose's Frankenstein reboot is a welcome update to Shelley's long-remade classic, adapting old themes to a new, more tech savvy reality.</Review>
            <Review>Bernard Rose has constructed a refreshing take on a horror classic with a freakishly fascinating performance from Xavier Samuel. Frankenstein is tragic and sentimental underneath with a gloriously hideous exterior.</Review>
            <Review>No neck bolts or flat-top 'do here. This Frankenstein is a thoroughly modern monster who doesn't fit into our class-based society.</Review>
            <Review>Rose's focus is more on the story's tragic elements, while his updating accommodates all kinds of commentary on the gulf between the beautiful, privileged people of Hollywood and the alienated, overlooked underclass just down the road.</Review>

            <Review>For those looking for a sports film of basic quality and genuine narrative, "My All American" is definitively useless.</Review>
            <Review>"My All American" would have done better to dig deeper in its portrayal of a man who set such a high bar for the intrinsic character of a football player. Because he's actually the kind of example the sport could really use right now.</Review>
            <Review>So white bread and scrubbed clean of any edges that it plays like a Saturday matinee at the cineplex in Pleasantville.</Review>
            <Review>This is ideal fodder for Pizzo's brand of college-sports inspiration, but he pours on the corn syrup a little too thick.</Review>
            <Review>Not an inspirational football movie but the highlights reel from one, with a golden boy who is his own manic pixie dreamboat. The worst sort of hagiography.</Review>

            <Review>Don't miss this crackling - and deeply important - film about the power of the press.</Review>
            <Review>Invigorating moviemaking in every way imaginable, "Spotlight" is spot-on.</Review>
            <Review>"Spotlight" isn't quite as good as "All The President's Men," the gold standard of films about journalism. But it's close.</Review>
            <Review>This is why Spotlight's moral of humility is so powerful. There are so many things that we don't know, so many assumptions that we don't recognize as such, so many questions that we haven't even thought to ask.</Review>
            <Review>If there was a Best Ensemble acting category, the cast of Spotlight would be a frontrunner. The film has no lead actor but there are five or six strong supporting performances.</Review>
            <Review>Like the story being reported within the film, Spotlight is simultaneously emotional and clear-eyed. It's an explosive yet necessary piece of journalism in and of itself. And it's easily one of the year's best.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately, the story these journalists chased was about how institutional power degrades when it gets taken for granted.</Review>
            <Review>Spotlight is an impressive film, not so much for any particular twists or turns in the plot, which at this stage is public record, but rather for the impressive humanity and commitment of the performances from a top-notch cast.</Review>
            <Review>Shattered Glass is still the best movie about journalists I've ever seen, but Spotlight is definitely the best movie about journalism.</Review>
            <Review>As a tribute to rigorous, unglamorous, old-fashioned journalism, Spotlight is only more powerful for being released in the age of disposable digital media.</Review>
            <Review>Director Tom McCarthy... knows how to make the little big, but here he makes the big little-human, with confidence and grace. This is a terrific movie.</Review>
            <Review>Spotlight is acted and directed with great urgency -- and a little bit of necessary dread.</Review>

            <Review>Although evocative and nicely observed, the coming-of-age drama "Yosemite" ultimately proves too low-key and elliptical to make much of an impression. "Stand by Me" it ain't.</Review>
            <Review>The movie succeeds on its own quiet terms, binding the three parts together with assurance and tonal consistency to cast a lingering spell.</Review>
            <Review>Franco gives one of his most subtle performances yet as a recovering-alcoholic father, and the three young newcomers' performances are honest and affecting.</Review>
            <Review>A sobering, evocative drama.</Review>
            <Review>The material aspires to powerful terseness, but its seemingly conscientious refusal to ramp up too much drama ultimately renders it thinly anecdotal.</Review>
            <Review>Yosemite mines Franco's fiction for its most vital quality: his unsentimental depiction of youthful insecurity, this time among fifth-graders.</Review>
            <Review>Yosemite is a small but touching film, and has given voice to a new and interesting talent in Gabrielle Demeestere.</Review>
            <Review>An earnest examination of the loss of innocence this critic might have appreciated even more if the subject-matter hadn't be so relentlessly dark and disturbing.</Review>
            <Review>While many may find its slow pace and lack of action a bit frustrating, Yosemite is a thoughtful and well-executed coming of age indie...</Review>
            <Review>It's an interesting effort with a clear portrait of pre-adolescent curiosity, but it's not something to be viewed casually, as the feature's patience with tone takes some getting used to.</Review>
            <Review>Where STAND BY ME pressed its characters' faces into the stink of mortality, the boys here have yet to even hear the news about a dead body down by the train tracks.</Review>
            <Review>James Franco's "Boyhood"...random scenes sketching out boys' callowness, cruelty, compassion and comic books. And curiosity. Bi-curiosity.</Review>

            <Review>Extraction? I'd rather have my teeth pulled by diseased, evil monkeys.</Review>
            <Review>It takes confidence to put out a movie whose single-word title is also the procedure by which a dentist gets rid of a rotten tooth.</Review>
            <Review>It's a rare movie that can't be saved by Bruce Willis single-handedly killing all the bad guys. And yet, here it is: Extraction.</Review>
            <Review>The action-thriller "Extraction" may not be about tooth removal, but for all the fun it proves, it might as well be.</Review>
            <Review>Extraction's ... not, by any stretch of the imagination, "good." But at least it doesn't waste everybody's time.</Review>

            <Review>Bad acting, clunky cinematography and editing, heavy violence, and a less-than-genius screenplay make this a totally disposable action movie, not even recommendable to die-hard Willis ans.</Review>

            <Review>The kind of movie your stepdad would mention having seen on Netflix a few days back but have trouble remembering the name of. (He'd probably think it was pretty good, though.)</Review>
            <Review>"Diablo" boasts the skeleton of an interesting allegorical oater ... but Carlos de los Rios' screenplay never manages to provide flesh or a beating heart, leaving the whole endeavor feeling more like a rough draft.</Review>
            <Review>A relatively ordinary oater ...</Review>
            <Review>An early candidate for the 2016 worst movies list.</Review>
            <Review>Roeck aims for an homage to Eastwood Sr.'s revisionist Westerns (think The Outlaw Josey Wales, Unforgiven, etc.), but the result is pretentious and pointless.</Review>
            <Review>A western thriller with lots of plot holes and an obvious intention of fooling the viewer with "twists" you can see from a mile away. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Diablo is not a great film by any stretch but it is stylish.</Review>
            <Review>Subverts the cultural contradictions saturating westerns historically, while probing the post-Civil War PTSD pathology beyond the officially mythologized dark side wild west frontier. And another corrective to the portrayal of Native Americans on screen.</Review>
            <Review>It's impossible not to think of Clint Eastwood in his great Westerns when watching his youngest son, Scott, in this poor one, and the comparison isn't favorable. Both the movie and its star seem empty.</Review>
            <Review>I'll give Lawrence Roeck credit, at least he didn't reveal the twist to his new film Diablo in its last few minutes.</Review>
            <Review>As far as high concept western/horror flicks are concerned, "Diablo" is nowhere near the excellence of the recent VOD release "Bone Tomahawk," but it should be satisfying for audiences who are in store for a moody and intriguing genre exercise.</Review>
            <Review>There's not much beneath the surface of this modest vigilante saga.</Review>

            <Review>Forget a fake moon landing. "Moonwalkers" is a fake comedy ...</Review>
            <Review>Director Antoine Bardou-Jacquet, who devised the story, is dazzled by period style and puerile jokes, but nothing lands as especially funny, merely tired.</Review>
            <Review>The misguided "Moonwalkers" invests too much in the comedy potential of things that haven't been funny for a long while.</Review>

            <Review>From time to time, Cohn allows a few rays of light to penetrate the gloom and suggest that Alice may find a way transcend her despair. It's a small measure of relief from the overall mood of hopelessness.</Review>
            <Review>The director, Ms. Cohn, making her feature debut, wrote the script and handily keeps the story's many elements in motion.</Review>
            <Review>VanCamp gives a layered, memorable performance, while writer/director Marya Cohn, making her feature debut, has crafted a nonlinear story that artfully tiptoes between cliche and truth.</Review>
            <Review>Though its resolution is a bit pat, most of "The Girl in the Book" is a smart and pointed look at abuses of power and roles women too often play in the literary world.</Review>
            <Review>As Alice, VanCamp is exceptional, eliciting our sympathy even when the character is making maddeningly self-destructive decisions.</Review>
            <Review>Cohn ... adeptly balances elements of contemporary romantic comedy and scathing cultural criticism in a film that is obviously deeply personal and simultaneously universal.</Review>
            <Review>Filmmaker Marya Cohn--directing a terrific cast-- deftly manages the flashback sequences [and] adds unexpected depth and empathy to some situations which are unfortunately already all too familiar. Brava!</Review>
            <Review>So unpretentious that it could be accused of lacking style or vigor, writer-director Marya Cohn's maturely conceived, Kickstarter-budgeted debut swaps genders on the more traditionally male-driven story of a stunted coming-of-age.</Review>
            <Review>[The filmmakers] lend the film's overall impact the alert observational intelligence of a first-rate short story.</Review>
            <Review>Cohn displays deep sympathy with her protagonist's intersecting emotional crises, scripting a narrative that's intensely perceptive without becoming mired in mawkishness.</Review>
            <Review>The Girl in the Book is an auspicious debut for Cohn, a showcase for VanCamp's true acting abilities, and a fascinating feminine story.</Review>

        <Duration>134</Duration>
        <StoryLine>In the mid-1970s, Twisted Sister claimed glitter rock for their own, cross-dressing their way to headlining every club within 100 miles of New York City. With gigs six nights a week, they were the most successful live bar band of suburban New York, fueled by their stage presence and aggressive setlists. But by the early '80s, they found themselves balancing on a double-edged sword, hugely popular with local audiences but without a national following or a record deal. When Twisted Sister finally got their big break in 1983, they became one of the biggest glam rock bands of the decade. To anyone who knew the hard-fought battle they'd won to get there, the band that killed disco was no overnight success.</StoryLine>

            <Review>If The Good Dinosaur falls low in the rankings of the company's now 16 titles, it is still leagues finer than the flurry of frenetic colors and screwball pacing of the standard children's animated movie.</Review>
            <Review>The Good Dinosaur is by no means a bad movie. But it breaks new ground for Pixar in that it's the studio's first feature that is explicitly-and pretty much exclusively-a kid's movie.</Review>
            <Review>The digital landscapes are meant to be breathtakingly beautiful, but they tend to come across more like very expensive screensavers or immersive desktop wallpapers.</Review>
            <Review>If The Good Dinosaur falls short in the narrative department, it represents a step forward for Pixar's artists.</Review>
            <Review>OK, it's not pushing the boundaries of storytelling, but it certainly does the job.</Review>
            <Review>The characters may look cartoony-and cloyingly cute-but they're wandering through what could be Thomas Hill paintings in panoramic widescreen.</Review>
            <Review>Even for a Pixar production, this is a technically stunning piece of animation, and there's great use of landscape and water that often provides a stark contrast to the more cuddly central characters.</Review>
            <Review>I personally object to kitschy, green, Mickey-D type plastic toys in a Sam Peckinpah type western setting, but the bottom line is, it's quite a good small-child film.</Review>
            <Review>Middle-tier Pixar is a lot higher than other middle-tiers.</Review>
            <Review>The rocks, trees, rivers and mountains are so real and breathtaking, it makes you itch for a pause button to linger and to stare.</Review>
            <Review>While conventional rather than adventurous, it's a simple and sentimental story about a likeable hero who overcomes the odds to become the dinosaur his father always dreamed he'd be.</Review>
            <Review>The script is puzzlingly devoid of wit, the conflicts and character arcs are unimaginative and stale, the pacing is inexorable, and the plotting is rudimentary at best.</Review>

            <Review>There's a chic emptiness to "Entertainment," undoubtedly, and anti-comedy constructs that may rub the wrong way, but there's also a spiky intelligence at work too, one that engages through the artifice of disengagement and the illusion of "performance."</Review>
            <Review>It is not fun, but its confrontational style yields dividends.</Review>
            <Review>A daring and mainly successful black comedy about a dour and depressive comedian on a dead-end tour of California.</Review>
            <Review>The Comedian is an ugly man with an ugly soul, and an ugly sense of comedy that at one point literally includes making fart noises for 90 full seconds as he pretends to gun down his silent audience with a soccer trophy.</Review>
            <Review>Like Hamburger's meta-hacky comedy routine, the film confronts and challenges in order to produce something increasingly rare in American cinema: an active, engaged experience.</Review>
            <Review>Weirdly compelling if student-y and unfocused ...</Review>
            <Review>Entertainment is a fully realised and extremely accomplished translation of Gregg Turkington's Neil Hamburger character to the big screen.</Review>
            <Review>Alverson continues to zero in on the most brutal tendencies of contemporary comedy.</Review>
            <Review>It's difficult to give Alverson and his star too much credit for depth, insight or having a point. Because I'm not certain they have one.</Review>
            <Review>This is one of those in-your-face, angry, confrontational movies. It wasn't just a chore to sit through, it was more like a homework assignment given to you by a teacher who hates your guts.</Review>
            <Review>A weird road flick about a weirdo stand-up comic with a weird repertoire.</Review>

        <Duration>71</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Through interwoven footage from three visits to North Korea with songs, spectacle, popular cinema and archival footage, we observe a different perspective on this enigmatic country that is typically seen through the distorted lens of jingoistic propaganda and derisive satire. Challenging the meaning of freedom, love, patriotism and ultimately the human condition, we come to understand the psychology of the North Korean people and the political ideology of absolute love which continues to drive the nation towards its uncertain future.</StoryLine>

            <Review>If we could unearth these guys from their living tomb, how hard is it to find nonwhite actors to play real people? ... Miner story, major fail.</Review>
            <Review>Mostly aims for easily mined deposits of nerves and heartstrings, rather than the more stubborn, more rewarding veins of character and soul.</Review>
            <Review>"The 33" is exactly what you can expect or hope with this story: a tense and uplifting film that puts an unbelievable true story to celluloid.</Review>
            <Review>In trying to breathe life into too many characters, the screenplay transforms them all into thinly-drawn caricatures. In focusing on its feel-good, inspirational ending, it fails to make nearly 2 hours of hardship a worthwhile experience.</Review>
            <Review>It's hard to think of another movie this year that has a stronger message about hope -- or a gentler one about forgiveness.</Review>
            <Review>The 33 reminds me of those great disaster movies of the 1970s, only this one is a true story. Without giving too much away, there's a lovely coda to this film, so don't rush for the exit at the end if you've an ounce of empathy for these miners.</Review>
            <Review>Director Patricia Riggen efficiently touches all the bases without doing what Ron Howard did so well in Apollo 13 - creating an air of uncertainty despite the final outcome being known.</Review>

            <Review>For commercial reasons, the film-makers opted to have everyone speak English with a South American accent... it distances the audience from the story. The sense of danger ebbs.</Review>
            <Review>The 33 feels perpetually caught between championing this triumph of human spirit and technical innovation over the forces of nature.</Review>

            <Review>"The Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution" arrives on PBS stations early next year. I suggest not waiting.</Review>
            <Review>The documentary connects the past and the present so forcefully that we see our own reflection in the struggle to bring power to the people.</Review>
            <Review>Nelson understands the play of outsized personalities and unexpected events, and he's helped that enough time has passed for former Panthers to feel comfortable telling their stories, especially to someone of Nelson's stature in the documentary world.</Review>
            <Review>[A] straightforward, liberal-minded history of the Black Panther Party.</Review>
            <Review>If "The Black Panthers" has been designed to leave viewers outraged and energized in equal measure, it succeeds with admirable style. It counts both as essential history and a primer in making sense of how we live now.</Review>
            <Review>A brisk, balanced mix of interviews, archival footage, and photos backed by a pointed soundtrack ...</Review>
            <Review>The Panthers' confused manifesto included shades of Marxism, Leninism and the black nationalist theories of Malcolm X... But the movement's descent into violence and corruption was swift and fatal, as Mr. Nelson's fine film painstakingly demonstrates.</Review>
            <Review>Despite the title, not at all a "fan" tribute to a group that like so many others in the mad 1960s imploded through a combination of state repression and its own ineptitude</Review>
            <Review>Nelson's documentary shows that the story wasn't as simple as most people remember today.</Review>
            <Review>Obviously, there's more about America's postslavery institutions and their resisters than can fit in a two-hour movie. But with the aid of an extra-funky soundtrack, Vanguard of the Revolution makes a good, fist-pumping start.</Review>
            <Review>Nelson's work, feeling more fragmented than kaleidoscopic, falls short of '60s-activist docs The Weather Underground (2002) or 1971 (2014). But sobering images and snippets of poetic insight linger.</Review>
            <Review>The thing that struck me watching this was how little things have changed with white privilege and police killing blacks since this group started out as a self defense organization in Oakland, California in 1966.</Review>

            <Review>As original and risk-taking as its subject, "Steve Jobs" will make you think differently about an American icon.</Review>
            <Review>A redemptive fable at once artful, elegant, and clean. But by stripping out any and all complications, the movie denies itself the opportunity for nuance and puts a ceiling on its own ambition.</Review>
            <Review>Thanks to Fassbender's revelatory performance, Jobs comes across as a captivating monster, a dictator in a black turtleneck who is impossible to ignore.</Review>
            <Review>It entertains and enlightens, and it's bang on in showing how great ideas are born not through compromise but through vision and determination.</Review>
            <Review>The acting is unarguably, uniformly strong.</Review>
            <Review>The dialogue crackles with wit, anger, and passion. By matching Sorkin's words with Boyle's style and Fassbender's talent, Steve Jobs has hit the trifecta.</Review>
            <Review>A sleek, energetic, depth filled and riveting character drama that rather brilliantly delves into the disturbing faults and stubborn genius that was part and parcel of Jobs' character.</Review>
            <Review>Steve Jobs is a magnificent movie.</Review>
            <Review>The Jobs here will always be "Aaron Sorkin's Jobs"... who people say was nerdier and more youthfully exuberant than the fully in-control maestro depicted in the film. But Fassbender does a great job with what he's given.</Review>
            <Review>Viewers who experience ardent adulation each time a new iPhone hits the market will lap it up, but others might wonder what all the fuss is about.</Review>
            <Review>If we absolutely must have Biopics of Great Men(TM), the least we can hope for is that they all try this hard.</Review>
            <Review>I'm not comparing Sorkin's prose with the Bard's, but using a widely known and culturally important figure as a way into telling stories with universal themes is, well, universal.</Review>

            <Review>Filmmaker J.P. Sniadecki withholds judgment and resists editorializing, but the result is frustratingly nebulous and devoid of context.</Review>
            <Review>"The Iron Ministry" is neither boring nor confining, which is just to say that it's not a long trip through a faraway country. It's a work of art - vivid and mysterious and full of life.</Review>
            <Review>The overheard conversations touch on social issues (e.g., China's rapid industrialization and rampant unemployment) addressed more thoroughly in numerous recent Chinese films.</Review>
            <Review>What emerges is a sense of an optimistic people well aware of how hard times can be but convinced they might be getting better.</Review>
            <Review>The parallel tracks of railways and cinema profitably converge yet again in J.P.Sniadecki's outstanding, semi-experimental documentary The Iron Ministry, a pungently immersive evocation of traveling on Chinese trains.</Review>
            <Review>For a fly-on-the-wall ethnographic film, Iron Ministry is surprisingly funny.</Review>
            <Review>The Iron Ministry is a rather odd work for many reasons, even if its depiction of class and ethnicity on various trains across modern China captures an essential moment.</Review>
            <Review>A subtly political film about the hopes and frustrations of ordinary Chinese citizens that is as dramatic in its own odd way as a kung-fu costume drama.</Review>
            <Review>Seamlessly rides many rails through China to intimately experience sounds, sights, and even smells, alongside restless people on the move through space and economic change.</Review>
            <Review>Coolly formal yet ceaselessly tactile... works from lovely visual abstraction to the most material of physical concerns... immaculate [sound design], a song for ears that crave the sound of rail travel and the insistent buzz of human commerce.</Review>
            <Review>Though J.P. Sniadecki doesn't elucidate any broad structural motive, his film gradually adopts an engrossing rhythm among its clatter of steel and ambient chatter.</Review>

            <Review>Trumbo is ... a blast, even if the screenplay perversely lacks the energy of its title character, who is played with great wit and brio by Breaking Bad's Bryan Cranston.</Review>
            <Review>It's a period piece full of colorful characters, natty costumes, jaunty music.</Review>
            <Review>The movie's main idea seems to be that, in the end, people prefer movies to ideas. Or at least ideologies.</Review>
            <Review>A fun, highly watchable film.</Review>
            <Review>Roach's direction is pedestrian. He turns the picture into an earnest primer of the issues of the era and a road map of how Trumbo slowly resuscitates his career ...</Review>
            <Review>Trumbo's biggest misstep is in sacrificing an aura of authenticity for gaudiness in its attempts to capture an unsavory era of American filmmaking.</Review>
            <Review>Trumbo just feels a bit too much like all those sainthood biopics that appear around Oscar season, with their sheen of "quality" and simplistic righteousness that defines the genre.</Review>
            <Review>Newcomers who are lured in by the solid cast won't find a lot to grab on to here, story-wise.</Review>
            <Review>I assume Cranston's Oscar nomination was in recognition of not dying of shame when he's obliged to explain Communism to his daughter during a scene lit and staged like an ad for chlamydia medication.</Review>
            <Review>Handsomely designed, if schematic.</Review>
            <Review>For all the smart people involved in its making, and for all the smart people it's about, this is not a movie that's all that interested in complexity - in either its storytelling or its morality.</Review>

            <Review>Though Whelan's debut filmmaking effort wears some of its homemade characteristics proudly, it wrangles more than enough credible interviewees to make its points.</Review>
            <Review>A chilling exploration of the toxic underpinnings of the word "fragrance" that appears on detergents and colognes alike.</Review>
            <Review>Breezy, Michael Moore-ish environmental documentary by a non-tree-hugging venture capitalist advocates for disclosure of carcinogenic chemicals in everyday products.</Review>
            <Review>A rather slipshod approach to the science of the subject undermines what might otherwise be a very strong film.</Review>
            <Review>Though repetitious, this muckraking documentary exposes the dangers of chemicals that corporations put into some of their products.</Review>

            <Review>"Criminal Activities" is a sneaky, snaky little crime thriller with some pretty impressive plot twists.</Review>
            <Review>Haley whips it into something reasonably entertaining even as you start thinking about how truly great "Get Shorty" and Travolta's Chili Palmer were midway through those double-crossing criminal activities.</Review>
            <Review>A profane thriller that so closely resembles the B-movies that followed "The Usual Suspects," "Pulp Fiction" and "Get Shorty," it could be mistaken for an archeological discovery.</Review>
            <Review>It owes as much to Quentin Tarantino as the four bunglers owe to Eddie. Yet it doesn't feel like a mere imitation; it has too much wit and too many striking performances for that.</Review>
            <Review>An eleventh hour twist adds a bit of intrigue, and everyone - including Haley himself, as a henchman - seems to be having a pretty good time.</Review>
            <Review>It won't win any awards, but it's not a bad evening out.</Review>
            <Review>While it seemingly draws on the likes Tarantino's Pulp Fiction and True Romance, there's still something alluring and awfully inviting about Jackie Earle Haley's lively and intriguing directorial debut, Criminal Activities.</Review>
            <Review>An exciting revenge thriller enhanced by 'Pulp Fiction' vibes and a fascinating -- but quirky -- performance by Dan Stevens (as you've never seen him before).</Review>
            <Review>Some stylish touches and committed performances enliven this otherwise generic crime thriller.</Review>
            <Review>I almost wish that the film would have centered on Travolta and Haley's characters since the plot threads involving the four friends get wrapped up in about half-a-dozen The Usual Suspects wannabe twists.</Review>
            <Review>All sound and fury, signifying nothing -- just clichés begetting clichés.</Review>
            <Review>If you don't expect much in terms of originality, there are some good times to be had here.</Review>

            <Review>Although Bad Hurt traffics in tough material, it is filled with little moments of heart.</Review>
            <Review>Although affecting and well acted, the family drama "Bad Hurt" is too airless and depressing to fully engage.</Review>
            <Review>Throughout, the filmmakers live up to the movie's title. But as the story comes to a close, they opt to wrap it in comforting cliché, and they turn a miserable but credible viewing experience into a confounding one.</Review>
            <Review>An explosive family drama whose intense performances can't always compensate for such a heavy-handed scenario, Bad Hurt nonetheless marks a promising directorial debut from playwright Mark Kemble.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>Spectre is sloppier than other recent Bonds, but it also feels like it's exhausted the idea that fueled the franchise's relaunch -- darker and more realistic can only last so long when it's paired with a rotating cast of Bond girls and supervillains.</Review>
            <Review>I regard it as a ravishing exercise in near-despair, with Bond beset by the suspicion that, were he to desist, both his character and his cause would be unmasked as a void. Killing is his living, and his proof of life.</Review>
            <Review>Dazzles early and fizzles late...Bond is not Batman; he does not need an origin story.</Review>
            <Review>There are signs of Bond bloat within many of the action sequences - it must be hard to trim such extravagant footage - but they are at least partly overcome by an increase in levity.</Review>
            <Review>If one of the most successful and long-running franchises in movie history wants to keep pumping, it's once again time to change the formula.</Review>
            <Review>For the most part, it's efficient-enough Bond fare - overlong car chases, beautiful women in eternal danger, crazy stunts, suave cool under fire. Nice fitting suits.</Review>
            <Review>SPECTRE doesn't quite measure up, but it's still a good night out.</Review>
            <Review>[Daniel Craig's] latest adventure feels more like an homage to Bond's past than a continuation of his recent hot streak.</Review>
            <Review>Daniel Craig recently said that he'd rather "kill himself" than do another Bond film -- and in Spectre, his misery shows.</Review>
            <Review>For large portions of the middle, this is the most that a Bond film has felt like a Bond film since Pierce Brosnan retired.</Review>
            <Review>The 24 Bond films sugarcoat a profession that really boils down to a whole lot of breaking-and-entering, snooping, and cold-blooded murder. This one's still decent though.</Review>
            <Review>It will surely be catnip for the hardcore fans, although younger viewers may find it too narratively clunky and self-referential to be involving.</Review>

            <Review>With not a wasted frame in its taut 80 minutes, this is deserving of your attention as one of the year's best movies even if it's being released in the middle of August.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director Paul Weitz turns in a generous, handcrafted piece in which everyone shines.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is both hysterically funny and heartbreaking, but Weitz somehow makes you laugh without making light of serious issues.</Review>
            <Review>Both funny and unexpectedly moving.</Review>
            <Review>Short, tart, yet unexpectedly sweet, Paul Weitz's "Grandma" is a small-scale character study - and, because that character is played by the great Lily Tomlin, it's mesmerizing, right up until its final frame.</Review>
            <Review>Lily Tomlin and her female counterparts excel in this drama/comedy/road movie hybrid -- a warm, small film, not earth-shattering, but genuine.</Review>
            <Review>Tomlin carries it off with a world-weary, deadpan delivery reminiscent of the great Buster Keaton.</Review>
            <Review>Grandma is a tiny, precious delight.</Review>
            <Review>The best thing about Grandma, other than Tomlin's furious and funny performance, is that Elle never gets too cuddly.</Review>
            <Review>It is one of those performances, like Bruce Dern in 'Nebraska' or Julie Christie in 'Away from Her,' that seems a culmination of everything that's great about a beloved actor, and a celebration of them.</Review>
            <Review>Lily Tomlin is hilarious and heart-felt as Elle in the film Grandma, directed by Paul Weitz (About a Boy, Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist).</Review>

            <Review>Holiday entertainment that feels more like a horror movie.</Review>
            <Review>It's part sitcom and part soap opera that pokes mild fun at the season but has a wide sentimental streak.</Review>
            <Review>Alas, Love the Coopers focuses too much on interfamily drama to salvage the real Christmas spirit.</Review>
            <Review>The ensemble give the scant material their all, and this may be Olivia Wilde's most impressive performance to date, but the contrived plot, forced sentimentality and painfully predictable climax overshadow their work.</Review>
            <Review>Love the Coopers reminds us that there are few things worse than booze-fuelled family gatherings, but one of them is definitely schmaltzy Hollywood movies about such reunions.</Review>
            <Review>Charmless, confusing and utterly embarrassing, this could and should have been a lot more than just another run-of-the-mill Christmas flick which we're soon to forget.</Review>
            <Review>Only occasionally does a moment ring true, thanks largely to talented actors subduing a balky script like parents wrestling a petulant kid onto Santa's lap.</Review>

        <StoryLine>August 3, 1952. Live Oak, Florida, the heart of the Jim Crow South. 11:34 AM. Ruby McCollum, age 42, shoots State Senator-elect, Dr. Clifford LeRoy Adams, firing her .32-caliber revolver four times into his body, before going home and warming a bottle of milk for her baby daughter. What began as a bizarre murder case quickly turned into a bright light on the rotting underbelly of the Old South. Ruby McCollum was the wealthiest black woman in Suwannee County, Florida. She lived in one of Live Oak's finest homes. Her husband, Sam, ran the local numbers racket, owned several farms, and sat on the board of Florida's largest black life insurance company. They were church going, upstanding members of the community. Their eldest son had been accepted to UCLA. Murdering the most powerful white man in the town over a doctor's bill would seem the least-likely crime she might commit. (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>This is an ambitious little film, one that relies on character and plot to do the hard work for it, trading less in spectacle and more in human nature and that's all to the well and good.</Review>

            <Review>Marshland has superb performances and a heady atmosphere, but its greatest strength is finding resolution while letting the mystery be.</Review>
            <Review>The elegant widescreen compositions and use of light and shadows are strongly reminiscent of Seven and Zodiac, and the film's eerie, disconcerting mood brings to mind HBO's True Detective.</Review>
            <Review>Visually and atmospherically, Marshland is suffused with an eerie oppressiveness, entirely at odds with the region's reputation for light-hearted alegria.</Review>
            <Review>A couple of mismatched cops in the immediate post-Franco era investigate the brutal murders of two teenage girls in Alberto Rodriguez's satisfyingly atmospheric neo-noir.</Review>
            <Review>A taut, visually sumptuous and hugely entertaining thriller.</Review>
            <Review>Superbly photographed, brilliantly edited, with every cut taking you to a suspenseful new act, and acted to perfection as viewers try to discover whom even they can have faith in.</Review>
            <Review>Brilliant noir policier in a distinctive environment where the fraught political and economic circumstances hang over the solution to a shocking crime.</Review>
            <Review>Even if it stays true to the conventions of the crime drama, it dares to explore complicated themes of the political and social issues of the time its set on. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Whilst its broad plot might be a touch too neat, Marshland manages to say quite a lot about entrenched neglect and ignorance both within and without systems of power</Review>
            <Review>While we're still pretending that True Detective season 2 didn't happen, we have Alberto Rodríguez's thriller Marshland to satisfy our yearning for moody detectives investigating a disturbing case that shakes their faith in humanity.</Review>
            <Review>Um filme que, sob a superfície de suspense policial, constrói um painel complexo de um país lidando com feridas que jamais fecharam.</Review>

            <Review>There's a surplus of double-dealings, plot twists and international locales to justify the theatrical treatment.</Review>
            <Review>A film that, like most of its ilk these days, is more interested in action than motivation.</Review>
            <Review>Led by the honorably dour Firth and the charisma-free Harington, MI-5 is convoluted and dull ...</Review>
            <Review>"Undone by sentimentality," grumbles a senior secret agent in "Spooks: The Greater Good," having been foiled when a long-favored rendezvous location proves a trap. He might as well be talking about the film itself.</Review>
            <Review>Even if the film can't match Hollywood for spectacle, there's a sobering sense of the painful sacrifices facing those who toil to keep us safe from harm.</Review>
            <Review>Dreary thriller about British spook.</Review>
            <Review>There's a lot to commend in Spooks: The Greater Good, but at the end of the day it offers nothing new to the genre and it's big-screen adaptation just needed to be more daring and step out of the confines of television.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately, it's Firth's film, and he ensures it's never less than thoroughly watchable.</Review>
            <Review>Can an enduring, hardy British television show make it on the big screen?</Review>
            <Review>It's difficult to call it great, more like Spooks: The Quite Good.</Review>
            <Review>Spooks: The Greater Good, though nothing entirely new, is a pacy, well-crafted spy-thriller that certainly matches the competition.</Review>
            <Review>"MI-5" is no action b-movie classic, but it manages to weave a complex and compelling narrative knot, mix in some absorbing musings about the nature of doing right and following orders, and pack in some nail-biting shoot outs.</Review>

But this delicate balance was ripped apart when the alien apocalypse arrived in Dillford and put an end to all the harmony. Now it's humans vs. vampires vs. zombies in all-out, blood-sucking, brain-eating, vamp-staking mortal combat - and all of them are on the run from the aliens. It is up to three teenagers - one human, one vampire, and one zombie - to team up, figure out how to get rid of the interplanetary visitors, and try to restore order to this "normal" little town.</StoryLine>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>Crimson Peak is an effort to make a throwback movie with modern effects and modern sex scenes, but it can't contend with the modern gaze with which we're looking at it.</Review>
            <Review>Del Toro builds a tight plot but never develops it; his frames are overdecorated with macabre clutter and smothered in shadow, but the atmosphere of dread never reaches ecstatic excesses.</Review>
            <Review>All the carefully orchestrated color schemes and all the dark corridors and secret chambers and all the flowing red metaphors in the world can't accelerate the slow patches, or make us care about lead characters.</Review>
            <Review>The real wonder is the sumptuous production design by Thomas E. Sanders, whose darkly colorful sets were inspired by Stanley Kubrick's The Shining.</Review>
            <Review>Del Toro just goes for effect, and the effect he seems to be going for here is something like, "Ew, Guillermo, that's really gross."</Review>
            <Review>Guillermo del Toro's latest dive into the darkness is a sumptuous, beautifully constructed tale that feels both archaic and inviting.</Review>
            <Review>To absorb the extraordinary details, colors, shapes and situations that are rife with layered danger is to witness this director's fierce commitment to his own vision.</Review>
            <Review>Beautiful and well-acted, expertly staged and shot, but tonally very uneven, veering wildly from one style of film to another with little warning.</Review>
            <Review>A movie for people who love the old Hammer Gothics precisely for their stately goofiness.</Review>
            <Review>Not only did I love every silly, gothic, gorgeous minute of Guillermo del Toro's Crimson Peak, I'm actually suspicious of those who didn't.</Review>
            <Review>It compensates for its lack of psychological finesse... by the lush visuals that background this grotesque romance. There's a lot of crimson in this delicious tale, and we're happy to savour it all.</Review>
            <Review>What Crimson Peak does have is proper scares, thanks to performance artist Doug Jones, when he does that thing he does, reminding us how unnerving a simple arm or leg movement can be.</Review>

            <Review>A simplistic but stirring morality play centered on the pressure point of the savings-and-loan crisis.</Review>
            <Review>[Garfield] the protege is the film's first weak point: his avowed decency - he loves his simple mom and moppety son! - is a flimsy thing, and its quick collapse leaves our hero both pathetic and despicable.</Review>
            <Review>"Inside Job" could almost be an alternative title for this gripping and timely drama, which makes none of the family's choices look easy.</Review>
            <Review>A gripping dramatic thriller about the winners and losers in America's game of mortgage roulette.</Review>
            <Review>This is a film of palpable anger, a finger on the pulse of modern America crafted by a team of rare ability to awaken outrage.</Review>
            <Review>Bahrani's film asks a timely, yet timeless, question: How far would you go to save your home? Would you be wiling to lose yourself in the bargain?</Review>
            <Review>99 Homes is worth seeing, especially for the urgent, raw work by both the actors and Bahrani, and for what it says about the American economy.</Review>
            <Review>Dynamic and passionate, thrumming with barely suppressed anger, this sleek American indie has the brains of a documentary, the soul of a moral fable and the beating pulse of a thriller.</Review>
            <Review>99 Homes is very good at showing that the housing crisis is not a problem that belongs to one person.</Review>
            <Review>How entertaining could a heavy-handed drama about the 2010 U.S. foreclosure crisis - one with a comically bad climax - possibly be? Pretty entertaining, it turns out.</Review>
            <Review>Sustained rhythm, urgent framing, and a perniciously overbearing score ensure this second venture into the darkness of a systemic failure will not be forgotten so quickly.</Review>
            <Review>By the way, Shannon ("Boardwalk Empire") is brilliant in the role. I truly admire this actor. He is going to win the Oscar some day. His performance in "99 Homes" should have him a nomination.</Review>

            <Review>An impressive slice-of-life drama that's tinged with unease and strangeness</Review>
            <Review>Tucker Green certainly isn't shy about testing her audience's patience, and while she can sometimes get a bit too enamored with her own moody, elliptical atmospherics, there's clearly a unique imagination at work here ...</Review>
            <Review>We see a family at its best and at its worst, with the grumpy mealtime silences and the playful banter. Much of this is down to the first-rate performances from Elba and Marshall.</Review>
            <Review>In a highly nuanced central performance, Marshall is both engaging and evasive, perfectly matching the fluid tone of Tucker Green's enigmatic urban parable.</Review>
            <Review>Leaves no doubt that its central supernatural event is 100% real, yet it makes absolutely no case for it whatsoever, and refuses to even engage with it.</Review>
            <Review>The pace will be too slow for some but, still, if you make it to the end, you'll come away chuffed.</Review>
            <Review>Heralds the emergence of a major new filmmaking talent in Debbie Tucker Green.</Review>
            <Review>Overall this is a British film of rare ambition and imagination, which builds to a final image of heart-stopping grace.</Review>
            <Review>Second Coming is an enigmatic and quietly impressive piece of storytelling.</Review>
            <Review>A mysterious and intimate fable in the guise of gritty social realism, simply and powerfully acted.</Review>
            <Review>The title and central concept may be ripe with religious allusions, but there's no heavy-handed allegorising here. Nor does the film ever veer off into soapy drama: forget about any shock reveals or intrigues.</Review>
            <Review>A soulful drama that heralds the arrival of a new voice in British cinema.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2016</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>99</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Man's best friend turns against him when a horde of bloodthirsty wild dogs descends upon a family's farmhouse. In a remote stretch of the Australian Outback, a sheep rancher, his veterinarian wife, and their two teenage children live in bucolic isolation-until a horrifying night when a pack of fang-bearing, four-legged rabid beasts besiege their home. With no one around to help them, the family must band together to survive-or else become canine kibble. Generating a steadily mounting sense of dread, this film cleverly toys with genre conventions before it goes in for the kill.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Ultimately, these feral dogs pose no danger that couldn't be solved by staying inside, boarding the windows and barricading the doors. It's not a bad approach to the film itself.</Review>
            <Review>We learn nothing much about the family members except that outsmarting dogs doesn't seem to be their forte. Also not a forte of anyone involved in this project: originality in picking a name.</Review>
            <Review>"The Pack" won't make anyone forget "Jaws" - or even "Cujo."</Review>
            <Review>It's an effective thriller that sets out to scare the living daylights out of even the most skeptical viewer and delivers in spades.</Review>
            <Review>The attractiveness of the package and the steady pace at which it doles out the action more than make up for the character shortcomings in one of the best animals-run-amok horror movies in recent memory.</Review>
            <Review>Despite the interesting openings the film punctures in its formula, the detours from the expected course of events are short and return us firmly to known genre territory.</Review>
            <Review>The Pack is pretty terrific.</Review>

            <Review>Flawed as it is, "River" reminds us where all the great music came from.</Review>
            <Review>Three of the guitar marvels shown here - Hubert Sumlin, Teenie Hodges and Skip Pitts - have died since filming. This is a marginal but worthwhile footnote to their legacy.</Review>
            <Review>The premise for this documentary couldn't be more stilted, and some of the matchups are enough to make you wince. But there are a few striking intergenerational moments.</Review>
            <Review>There's some talk about the collaboration's significance, and there's some racially charged history to relate, but the real point is to hear these oldsters one last time, to remember and maybe even discover what they gave us.</Review>
            <Review>"Take Me to the River" includes just enough history of the civil rights era to lend it gravitas. The color-blind recording practices of studios like Stax were an anomaly at the time and are well worth noting.</Review>
            <Review>"Take Me to the River" is at its most interesting when zeroing in on the back-and-forth between musicians of different eras ...</Review>
            <Review>While you may stick around for the stories, the film's true draw is the music.</Review>
            <Review>Take Me to the River is a good-spirited but patchy documentary, less about dropping beats and more about dropping names.</Review>
            <Review>Even if the filmmaking loses focus at times, the personalities on-screen are consistently engaging, and the experimental collaborations yield some toe-tapping tracks.</Review>
            <Review>While those sessions result in full songs, some of the most memorable, iconic tunes in music history, this film never coalesces into something greater than a collection of mildly interesting pieces.</Review>
            <Review>A moving tribute to a grand piece of Americana.</Review>
            <Review>It feels like a mishmash effort overall, more a home movie than a theatrical release. That's fine. If you approach it on those terms, you can't help but feel the love, too.</Review>

            <Review>Bridge of Spies is a heart-on-its-sleeve affirmation of American values -- not in the loaded contemporary sense of the term, but in the way the country was founded on values we have to work and fight to abide by.</Review>
            <Review>Authentic re-creations of the period, including duck-and-cover clips about a nuclear holocaust that frightened young students, serve as a reminder of a time, not unlike our own, when the threat of terror kept a steady and disturbing beat.</Review>
            <Review>Spielberg and Charman frame Donovan as a thin bulwark against the American government's attempts to work around its own supposed ideals at the height of the Cold War.</Review>
            <Review>Bridge of Spies connects Cold War paranoia to today's terror. That's a bridge worth building.</Review>
            <Review>When all the international parties finally meet up at the shadowy titular bridge, we get to witness humanity - and classic filmmaking - at its finest.</Review>
            <Review>When a film is as enjoyable as this one, its timing so sweet, and its atmosphere conjured with such skill, do you really wish to register a complaint? Would it help?</Review>
            <Review>Bridge of Spies is never less than brilliantly made, tense and with a satisfyingly twisty plot but Spielberg's recurring late period theme of honest men doing their best in a wicked world is just a little over-baked.</Review>
            <Review>Bridge of Spies is a bit overstuffed and full of itself, but it is competently made, a little exciting and a little funny and a little, well, little.</Review>
            <Review>For all its limitations, it's one of the few genuinely brainy Oscarbait films of the year.</Review>
            <Review>Though there's little action, the heart races and fists clench.</Review>
            <Review>There is plenty of striking work on view, including that of Mr. Dreamworks himself, who still has eerily keen instincts for maximizing the emotional impacts of his shots.</Review>
            <Review>This is a filmmaker with a lifetime of skill and experience, crafting his vintage pictures with style and grace, and we're all better off for it.</Review>

            <Review>Functioning as light satire, Dr. Cabbie never quite digs deep enough.</Review>

            <Review>What makes The Prophet worth watching is the animation.</Review>
            <Review>Unfortunately the drawn-out, drably rendered framing device that strings together these flights of fancy does them no service, and the devout detours merely detract from the minimal appeal of the story.</Review>
            <Review>With top-shelf talent like Bill Plympton, Tomm Moore and Nina Paley on board, it's no surprise that the segments are as attractive as they are different.</Review>
            <Review>For audiences interested in an earnest, inspirational story, full of timeless messages and beautiful animation, this is a lovely reminder of how to live life with purpose and joy.</Review>
            <Review>The eight independently produced vignettes, culled from Gibran's larger work and strung together by director Roger Allers to create a storyline where there was none, are an entertaining lot.</Review>
            <Review>The film is likely to attract new readers to the book - and remind longtime fans why they were attracted to the writings in the first place.</Review>
            <Review>As a calling card for eight indie animators, it gets the job done.</Review>
            <Review>The eight vignettes are visual magic compared to the Disney-lite narrative framing, so the whole thing eventually feels like it is dragging. This will work on dvd though, where fans of the original material can choose which scenes to watch at leisure.</Review>
            <Review>An interesting experiment that compiles different styles of animation in a single film. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>

            <Review>Breathe is a deftly observed look at teen power games and how closeness can turn to animosity in one miserable night out.</Review>
            <Review>In some ways it plays like a horror movie, in other ways it's almost a documentary.</Review>
            <Review>Nuanced, sensitive, and unflinching ...</Review>
            <Review>These are extraordinary performances, and considering France's way of nurturing female talent, Japy and de Laage could be at the dawn of 40-year careers. They're that good.</Review>
            <Review>The entire piece is precisely woven together, from script to performance to execution, and the result is a chilling study of emotional annihilation and its aftermath.</Review>
            <Review>I can tell you that Ms. Laurent's direction is astute and economical, that both of the film's young stars give fine performances, and that "Breathe" is a very good title for a film that ever so gradually takes your breath away.</Review>
            <Review>Subtitled teen drama with bullying, alcohol, and sex.</Review>
            <Review>The examination of the unknowable and undeniable power and pain of a broken friendship on display in Breathe is truly something to behold.</Review>
            <Review>A modest but keenly observed coming-of-age drama about an average suburban teenager.</Review>
            <Review>With boys -- and men -- on the side, the females of the film anchor it with ease, once again proving that a good drama is dependent on everything except the actors' genders.</Review>
            <Review>Breathe offers ample evidence of the growing confidence and skill of Melanie Laurent as a director.</Review>
            <Review>Laurent has an excellent eye for shot composition, and cinematographer Arnaud Potier's crisp photography aids the director in creating an enviable set of gorgeous and memorable shots, and the film is consistently visually compelling.</Review>

            <Review>Bell and Pegg are utterly defeated by a screenplay that favours plot over characterization to an almost surreal, parodic degree.</Review>
            <Review>Both actors stay sharp through some pretty degrading moments, and if Palmer and screenwriter Tess Morris are bent on serious button-pushing in the closing scenes, at least they garnish it with playfulness and wit.</Review>
            <Review>Man Up has a couple of bits that don't quite work and the ending is just silly, but for the most part, Pegg and Bell carry this thing through sheer force of personality.</Review>
            <Review>Aside from the silly title and disappointingly pat ending, even the rom-com-averse will find something to love about Man Up.</Review>
            <Review>Bell and Pegg, both terrific comic actors, mine small gestures and reactions for laughs. But they're at their best when they're talking, and they talk a lot in "Man Up."</Review>
            <Review>There are enough twists, turns and strange little bumps in the road to make this well-traveled journey to romantic comedy bliss surprisingly worthwhile.</Review>
            <Review>So many modern romantic comedies are the equivalent of a date that pukes on your shoes and steals your wallet; at least Man Up wants to be friends.</Review>
            <Review>A ruthless rom-com for the Tinder age, Ben Palmer's London-set love match is speedy, amusing and utterly, utterly heartless.</Review>
            <Review>Genuinely appealing.</Review>
            <Review>For all the rom-com conventions of the film (and there many...), it has a low-key charm and an adult take on expectations, disappointments, and missed opportunities...</Review>
            <Review>It's all very gener ic and predictable, but not in an entirely bad way. Man Up has its charms and it'll raise a smile, perhaps even a chuckle or two, if you're looking for a no-frills romcom.</Review>
            <Review>[Man Up] benefits largely from the hilarious dynamic between Pegg and Bell, and the humor alone is strong enough to recommend the film.</Review>

            <Review>In its best moments, Hellions is interesting and perplexing and worth soaking in, in the sense that one would admire a Hieronymus Bosch-inspired painting. But without at least one foot on the ground, it doesn't inspire fear.</Review>
            <Review>Some of the horror tropes being played with here - Rosemary's Baby is a clear touchstone - are staying up way past their bedtime.</Review>
            <Review>A perfect, light midnight movie that should go great with light drinks, good company, and a warm blanket.</Review>
            <Review>"Hellions" is art book horror, something to flip through but never truly eerie or scary.</Review>
            <Review>As the terror shifts from suggested to explicit, the eeriness wanes and this supernatural story becomes muddled.</Review>
            <Review>No matter how good these aesthetic tropes are at cultivating fear, however, the content inevitably falls prey to nervous laughter before sadly devolving further into eye-rolls.</Review>
            <Review>It's all fairly preachy nonsense, and never as cerebral as McDonald thinks it is.</Review>

The facts, as reported by the two narcotic detectives, just don't seem to add up. As she struggles to find the truth, the ramifications of a single lie reverberate throughout the whole precinct. Soon she finds she can't trust anyone, including the precinct captain. In this gritty crime thriller that could be ripped from today's headlines, it's cop vs. cop in a deadly fight for honor.</StoryLine>

Kate Burton ("Grey's Anatomy"), Edi Gathegi (X-Men: First Class) and Joe Anderson ("Hannibal") also star. -- (C) Gravitas Ventures</StoryLine>

            <Review>It pales in comparison to the recent epic saga tweeted by Aziah King about two strippers' unapologetic road trip from Detroit to Tampa, Fla., that went viral on the Internet.</Review>
            <Review>Despite its non-exploitative approach to its subject, the film... is too schematic and obvious to have the desired impact.</Review>
            <Review>Biel turns in a fine performance as the unlikely violent hero, but Mamet excels in a role far different than her Shoshanna on HBO's Girls.</Review>
            <Review>Bleeding Heart takes subject matter deserving of mature, thoughtful treatment and distorts reality into a series of soap opera clichés.</Review>
            <Review>If anything, this reminds me how much I'd like to see both Anderson and Biel - hell, even Mamet - in a better film than this.</Review>
            <Review>A potentially intriguing examination of family bonds and abusive relationships is relegated to the background in this generic revenge thriller.</Review>
            <Review>There may not be much surprising here, but this is a smartly sensitive depiction of abuse and redemption that never descends into caricature.</Review>
            <Review>Though violent and thrilling, Bleeding Heart is first and foremost a film about healing.</Review>
            <Review>There's a core of a good idea here, but the film itself is pale and anemic.</Review>
            <Review>Even worse than previous Biel indies like "Powder Blue" and "The Truth About Emanuel." Kudos to Biel for lending her modest star power to small, offbeat films, but she's backing some serious turkeys</Review>
            <Review>Bleeding Heart shows that all the asanas in the world can't change a man with hate in his heart.</Review>

            <Review>Page and Julianne Moore, who plays Hester, have an easy if not electric chemistry, but they seem hamstrung by the movie-of-the-week tropes and Peter Sollett's plodding direction.</Review>
            <Review>[Freeheld] is sincere, to be sure, but unlikely to win any prizes. For starters, the most memorable character in this important story of a courageous woman is a man; that's a problem.</Review>

            <Review>Ultimately, some of the answers in "Truth" are unsatisfying, but it asks important questions, which is one of journalism's chief responsibilities.</Review>
            <Review>Condescending, self-righteous and sloppy, Truth is simply a bad film for which there are no excuses.</Review>
            <Review>"Truth" is ... mesmerizing, entirely because of Blanchett; this is one of those movie-star performances in which every detail, every gesture feels right.</Review>
            <Review>Robert Redford plays Dan Rather. I know. Just reading that out loud seems odd -- but Redford does a terrific job of capturing Rather's on-air cadence and his larger-than-life off-air persona.</Review>
            <Review>Engrossing and occasionally moving ...</Review>
            <Review>Nobody does the aggrieved party better than Blanchett, who could play the title tragedians in any smart recasting of King Lear or Hamlet.</Review>
            <Review>When Truth falters, it's Blanchett's unyielding, captivating force that keeps it alive.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately, Truth feels like a wake for the death of the Wednesday 60 Minutes and, personally, I needed a hanky to get through it.</Review>
            <Review>Truth has an air of a film that thinks it's important. The story is fascinating but it would have been better served to portray it as what it actually is - a cautionary tale about quickie journalism and acting before you have solid proof.</Review>
            <Review>[It's] a ham-fisted telling of the chain of events at CBS News that got Dan Rather fired.</Review>
            <Review>Movies like 'Truth' tend to be highly politically charged and have complicated backgrounds. Regarding 'Rather-gate,' it's likely that multiple cases of strategery abound.</Review>
            <Review>Vanderbilt's attempts at interrogation simply do not get under the skin and fail to penetrate the cynical cycle of corruption and cover-ups, so palpably executed in Spotlight.</Review>

            <Review>By the time we get to the final, borderline ludicrous moments in Big Stone Gap, I wasn't even surprised by the overwhelming sappiness of it all.</Review>
            <Review>The movie ambles along amiably enough for a while; it's better if you are a fan of one or more members of the cast.</Review>
            <Review>That the creaky romantic comedy "Big Stone Gap" attracted such a large ensemble of talented name actors only makes this country-fried turkey feel like an even more notable miss.</Review>
            <Review>It's tempting to say "Big Stone Gap" is greeting-card pretty and sweet, but that doesn't quite fit because these days greeting cards seem to have developed a bit of an edge. "Big Stone Gap" is edge-free.</Review>
            <Review>The plot itself has little momentum, and what should feel dramatic instead feels inert.</Review>
            <Review>Nothing feels believable in "Big Stone Gap," a bungled, charm-free look at small-town life in the South in the late '70s.</Review>
            <Review>Flat comedy about small-town '70s life lacks laughs.</Review>
            <Review>Brutally mediocre.</Review>
            <Review>Sure, the script can be simpler than a diner menu. And at times the nostalgia seems manufactured like the goodies at a Cracker Barrel gift shop, but...Big Stone Gap proves to be...a nice change of pace from the summer popcorn-movie season.</Review>
            <Review>Unpretentious and it goes down easy, like sweet tea brewed by sunshine.</Review>
            <Review>Trigiani doesn't push the material into any energetic directions, but she does capture the sway of the town, better with atmosphere than dramatics.</Review>
            <Review>A novel setting surrenders to a seriously corny rural romance with not nearly enough laughs to put it over.</Review>

            <Review>Five stories by Edgar Allan Poe get varied treatment in this striking but inert animated compendium.</Review>
            <Review>Poe's storytelling gift is so timeless, and the voice actors assembled so captivating, that "Extraordinary Tales" can't help but work on some level. It just never quite rises above that faint praise.</Review>
            <Review>"Extraordinary Tales" reminds viewers that animation can enable an artist to realize an individual vision, even on a limited budget.</Review>
            <Review>Just in time for Halloween comes this singular tribute to Edgar Allan Poe from veteran animator Raul Garcia.</Review>
            <Review>The best sections reverberate with the power of Poe's words. As such, they serve as apt tributes to yarns that will always be more formidable on the page than on the screen.</Review>
            <Review>The voices of the late Christopher Lee and Bela Lugosi reading from the text isn't quite the same. But Garcia compensates with a different animation style for each of the five stories.</Review>
            <Review>Poe's creepy, unevenly adapted tales aren't for young kids.</Review>
            <Review>Unsure of its targeted demographic, Tales straddles the tonal line, flip-flopping like a fish left on the dock.</Review>

            <Review>The fact that an author who died 166 years ago continues to be a draw for moviemakers says something about Edgar Allan Poe's imagination. And here's a feverish new animated Poe feature -- released just in time for Halloween.</Review>
            <Review>Extraordinary Tales leaves us wishing for more: more running time, more of Poe's material, more of Garcia's macabre animated magic.</Review>

            <Review>Leaving aside the galloping misogyny, 'Rock the Kasbah' just isn't remotely funny or smart.</Review>
            <Review>As one-liner after one-liner misses its mark, you begin to feel sorry for Murray, who's really too old to be playing a guy who has a little daughter ... and likes to get kinky with Kate Hudson as a raucous, Dolly Parton-style hooker-businesswoman.</Review>
            <Review>It needs a smarter script. It needs at least two or three perfectly engineered, joke-after-joke sequences. It needs a smart director - did you really do "Wag the Dog," Levinson? - whose idea of political satire goes beyond freshman-year sarcasm.</Review>
            <Review>Not Murray's best and not Levinson's either.</Review>
            <Review>An acclaimed film director, a legendary comic actor, lots of fun rock and pop songs, and a noble story at its core can't save "Rock the Kasbah" from being one hugely misguided dud.</Review>
            <Review>The first half is pure pleasure as Murray gets thoroughly immersed and enmeshed in Kabul crazy.</Review>
            <Review>The biggest shock in a film that utilised every stereotype and cliché in the book is that The Clash's Rock The Kasbah doesn't feature. It could only have improved things.</Review>
            <Review>Murray's performance really is one of very few saving graces in this truly underwhelming piece of cinema.</Review>
            <Review>Murray is entertaining but the plot seems entirely arbitrary with characters such as Kate Hudson's happy hooker Merci popping up without much rhyme or reason. A real disappointment.</Review>
            <Review>A dog's dinner of a movie which not even the usually reliable Bill Murray can raise above the level of confused, cliched claptrap.</Review>
            <Review>Barry Levinson's film, loosely inspired by the true story of reality TV show Afghan Star, comes at its subject matter from entirely the wrong direction.</Review>
            <Review>It's a strangely lacklustre film that's happy to plonk Murray in a vaguely interesting crisis situation -- in this case, war-torn Afghanistan -- and just hope for the best.</Review>

            <Review>"Suffragette" is a meaningful history lesson, but as a movie, it plays like a slog through history class.</Review>
            <Review>The weight of the entrenched injustices these characters stagger under is enough to keep you on the verge of tears throughout.</Review>
            <Review>An intriguing premise dampened by thin characters and a formulaic story.</Review>
            <Review>Mulligan, in particular, delivers, bringing believability to a role that's quite a stretch, given the transformation her character has to go through from workaday mum to first-wave feminist superhero.</Review>
            <Review>Morgan's writing is occasionally pedestrian, but the sweep of the story, the performances and Gavron's vision make up for it.</Review>
            <Review>It's always compelling; you feel grateful, watching, that this story is being told at all.</Review>
            <Review>As grey and lifeless as the lethargic pedestrians wandering through the London streets.</Review>
            <Review>Fusing the civil rights picture with British miserablism, Sarah Gavron's grinding Suffragette offers very little room to breathe.</Review>
            <Review>A compelling and propulsive no-holds-barred interpretation, Suffragette does not shy away from accentuating the extreme subversive tactics employed by the bastions of the women's movement in the face of frenzied, brutal opposition.</Review>
            <Review>The movie isn't as dynamic as it could have been, but it gets to the core of what big, important social change means - and how little glory there is in ground work.</Review>
            <Review>Sarah Gavron's film is, amazingly, the first ever to be made about the Suffragettes.</Review>
            <Review>Suffragette barely delves into the inner workings of its political movement, opting instead for an admittedly sympathetic 'everywoman' protagonist.</Review>

            <Review>It is terrible. It is fabulously entertaining.</Review>
            <Review>Like that other witch hunter movie, "Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters," this is a film that is completely looney tunes, and it only half knows it.</Review>
            <Review>Unfortunately, a film needs more than Diesel's Stallone-ish appeal to succeed and that's where The Last Witch Hunter is found lacking.</Review>
            <Review>The Last Witch Hunter is so drenched in CGI effects, it looks as if it's been dunked in a vat of lacquer.</Review>
            <Review>A feature film that feels like a longish TV pilot.</Review>
            <Review>Watching The Last Witch Hunter is like sitting by while someone else plays a game whose coolness eludes us.</Review>
            <Review>A bunch of bizarre-for-the-sake-of-being-imaginative stuff happens in The Last Witch Hunter, much of it making little sense, and some of it that probably made sense but I hadn't the energy to figure it out.</Review>
            <Review>Although it's doubtful that The Last Witch Hunter will become a cult favorite like The Chronicles of Riddick, it's still a fairly enjoyable way to spend 98 minutes.</Review>
            <Review>Diesel is definitely not the kind of actor who can effortlessly coast through a film by dint of his rakish wit and charm. He needs a vehicle (ahem) that plays to his strengths. The Last Witch Hunter is definitely not such a vehicle.</Review>
            <Review>Even the considerable talents of Elijah Wood and Michael Caine cannot make this any more than another flick in which biceps give black magic a beatdown.</Review>
            <Review>The film's world-building suffers from too much ambiguity in the characters' motives and history (presumably saving them for a possible sequel), and the intricacies of the world are glossed over, making it all feel lifeless and fabricated.</Review>
            <Review>The often incoherent and repetitive plot doesn't have enough thrilling action to redeem its other shortcomings.</Review>

            <Review>Our Brand Is Crisis is the kind of movie that offers a look at a great antiheroine, but doesn't trust that she doesn't need to be tamed.</Review>
            <Review>Our Brand is Crisis hits a lot of clunky notes and the end is unforgivably cornball, but it's still one of the liveliest political black comedies I've seen in a while.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is funny enough to get its share of laughs but, in its angry heart, it's a tragedy - and the saddest part is that too much of this story is true.</Review>
            <Review>It's the first time I've watched a David Gordon Green movie and found myself wishing I was in the capable hands of a set-'em-up-knock-'em-down director like Jay Roach.</Review>
            <Review>Much of what the film considers fodder for satire is too familiar to feel revelatory or shocking, while characters that start out believable behave in unrecognizably ludicrous ways simply because the script forces them to.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately, "Our Brand Is Crisis" isn't as hard-hitting, trenchant or angry as it should be.</Review>
            <Review>Our Brand Is Crisis (2015), inspired by the 2005 documentary of the same name, is a political satire with an engaging cast but a dull bite.</Review>
            <Review>There is a serious functional problem running throughout in that some of the dialogue is conducted in Spanish with English subtitles, and some is conducted in English, even when Bolivians are talking to each other. How weird is that? Don't bother.</Review>
            <Review>Political cynicism is one of America's key exports.</Review>
            <Review>One of Bullock's best performances. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>A movie of note in this political jousting time of The Donald versus everybody else. Campaigns are showbiz; hair and makeup. Orange hair can give you an edge in the polls.</Review>

            <Review>More goofy fun than such a blatant cash-in ought to be.</Review>
            <Review>The film doesn't try hard to make the case that Hannah's as "real" as anyone else despite being from a book, though it easily could have. That's Goosebumps's implicit premise when it comes to the monsters, after all.</Review>
            <Review>It gently mocks the traditions of the genre -- giant preying mantis rips roof off high school -- while never getting too frightening.</Review>
            <Review>Jack Black fires up a stampede of comic terrors ready made for Halloween. Sure it's exhausting. But Goosebumps, knowing its audience, lets it rip.</Review>
            <Review>It's a cheerful, nasty delight.</Review>
            <Review>Goosebumps isn't detached or ironic, nor does it pretend to be something it's not. It's a bonus for fans who pored over the books and it celebrates the fun side of things going bump in the night.</Review>
            <Review>Chances are Goosebumps will prove to be a little too scary for those born after 2008 - fun for three-quarters of the family, if you will - but they'll grow into liking it.</Review>
            <Review>Generic tween tosh.</Review>
            <Review>The old- fashioned earnestness is welcome. Less so the lack of playfulness.</Review>
            <Review>Goosebumps feels like a tongue-in-cheek kids action adventure from the 80s -- such as Gremlins or The Goonies -- and deserves to sit beside them in the genre.</Review>
            <Review>[Treats] its audience to a steady stream of enjoyable human-versus-monster setpieces and delightful dummy-based physical comedy.</Review>
            <Review>Breezy, funny and unpretentious-to-the-bone, Goosebumps is not the most visually impressive or graphically imaginative film, but it's a terribly fun one.</Review>

Himself a child of a broken home, Che hasn't seen his father, Brian, in over 20 years, and presumes him dead. But after buying his father's childhood home, Che sets out to find him, and learns that he is now a homeless, alcoholic living only several blocks away.

            <Review>Though it brings limited insight to the problem of absent fathers in the black community, "In My Father's House" tells a story of loneliness, abandonment, anger, and joy that all can relate to.</Review>

            <Review>Mr. Piazza offers a persuasive portrait of decline, but it is the crumbling beauty and flailing hopes of Rose that resonate. Ms. Arquette comprehends the character inside and out, and her aim is true.</Review>
            <Review>The mix of callous humor and romantic doom doesn't always hold up, but in its best moments, "The Wannabe" finds real spikiness in the pitfalls of anti-hero worship.</Review>
            <Review>Few films are better titled than The Wannabe, a portrait of a Bronx kid who would have done anything to be part of the mob world he knew from the movies.</Review>
            <Review>The Wannabe is too derivative for any insight, offering little more than tired tropes and bad accents.</Review>
            <Review>Its taste in antiheroes doesn't inspire fascination, just a desire to see a different movie.</Review>
            <Review>The film is less a revisionist take on the circumstances of John Gotti's 1992 indictment than a tedious love child of Bonnie and Clyde and Goodfellas.</Review>
            <Review>Arquette shines, but this unmade-man mob movie lacks the energy and brutally dark humor of "Rob the Mob," which was about exactly the same story,.</Review>
            <Review>Thomas and Rose ricochet from one boneheaded, depressing escapade to another, and by the end you may start to feel as eager as the mobsters they're tormenting to get rid already of these babbos.</Review>

            <Review>The visuals relegate the acting to secondary importance. They overwhelm the story. And they make "The Assassin" unforgettable.</Review>

            <Review>This highly personal and lighthearted documentary gives some social context but never dives deep on the potentially devastating cultural divide it is exploring.</Review>
            <Review>[A] gently humourous doc.</Review>
            <Review>[A] charming, if completely obvious, documentary.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately a touching, funny documentary about family and cultural forces putting pressure on a first-generation Indian-American man to do what should come naturally: find love and a life partner.</Review>
            <Review>We enjoy Ravi's search for suitable mates, and we like his family. In the end, they just want each other to be happy - and that's all that matters.</Review>
            <Review>Meet the Patels ends up being much more than a movie about a guy going out on dates. It's about shifting identities, parental expectations and trying to hold on to a life raft of tradition in a swirling sea of change. And it's pretty funny, too.</Review>
            <Review>In this divisive culture some have worked hard to establish it's important to see a film that reminds us that despite our differences, we all have a lot more in common.</Review>
            <Review>How is dating in India different from dating in America? Indian culture is roughly 11,000 years old; ours-239 years. Dating is hilariously, eye-openingly different in India.</Review>
            <Review>[Patel's parents] are the real personalities of the movie, so good-humored and spirited, and so wonderful in sticking to their old-fashioned view of family life.</Review>
            <Review>One of the funniest romcoms of the year.</Review>
            <Review>Rather than taking a firm position for or against arranged marriages, "Meet the Patels" is a big-hearted, poignant and truly funny documentary that shows people will try anything to find love - and sometimes "anything" works.</Review>
            <Review>The documentary works as well as it does because Ravi, while exhibiting a wry, dry sense of humour, is also something of an introvert. He's not always looking for a punchline, so the ones he makes have more punch.</Review>

            <Review>Burnt is, to be clear, not a good movie. It is in fact a pretty terrible movie.</Review>
            <Review>A macho foodie fantasy with Cooper as a swaggering sex god in an apron. If this were a comedy, it would be brilliant.</Review>
            <Review>Lots of quick cuts and kitchen close-ups - of gas stoves, buttery saucepans and stock characters concentrating preciously on haute cuisine - and lots of unmoving melodrama.</Review>
            <Review>Bound to inspire headlines full of tiresome kitchen wordplay: "half-baked," "underdone," "lacks seasoning." What it really is, though, is late for dinner.</Review>
            <Review>Unless you also want a tremendous side of ego and hearty helping of yelling, Burnt may be a dish to skip.</Review>
            <Review>"Burnt" is overcooked. If that sounds like a glib way to describe an entertainment about the comeback of a celebrity chef, it's also perfectly suited to a movie that wears its glossiness as a badge of honor.</Review>
            <Review>Mostly, I thought Burnt was ridiculous. And yet I cannot tell a lie. Its familiar beats, comely cast, and lively kitchen montages entertained me.</Review>
            <Review>While 'Burnt' is totally predictable, and the terms 'slick' and 'feel-good' definitely apply, it'll still hold your attention.</Review>
            <Review>Not quite burnt then, but this dish could certainly do with greater depth and intensity of flavour.</Review>
            <Review>What does shine through though is Steven Knight's (Eastern Promises) pacey, humorous script, and director John Wells' (August: Osage County) genuine kitchen scenes.</Review>
            <Review>At the end the experience is insipid. [Full Review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>It's interestin that the main character is so unlikable yet so interesting. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>

        <Title>Jobriath A.D.</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>102</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Seventies glam rock musician Jobriath was known as "The American Bowie," "The True Fairy of Rock &amp; Roll," and "Hype of the Year." The first openly gay rock star, Jobriath's reign was brief, lasting less than two years and two albums. Done in by a over&amp;#8208;hyped publicity machine, shunned by the gay community, and dismissed by critics as all flash and no substance, Jobriath was excommunicated from the music business. He retreated to the Chelsea Hotel where he died, forgotten, in 1983 at the age of 37, as one of the earliest casualties of AIDS. In the years since his death, new generations of fans have discovered his music through acts as diverse as Morrissey, Def Leppard, The Pet Shop Boys, and Gary Numan, all of whom have cited Jobriath as an influence. Through interviews, archival material, and animation, audiences can experience the heartbreaking and unbelievable story of the one, the only, Jobriath. (c) Factory 25</StoryLine>

            <Review>Hampered by limited video of Jobriath, the film lacks a sense of him or his music.</Review>
            <Review>A cubist portrait of an unknowable man and a dramatic whodunit about an artist-victim who died by a thousand cuts.</Review>
            <Review>Documentary maker Kieran Turner attempts to rehabilitate Jobriath's reputation, presenting him as a gifted musician and a gay-rights pioneer.</Review>
            <Review>A long-forgotten, envelope-pushing figure of 1970s rock will be hard to forget again after Jobriath A.D.</Review>
            <Review>Eye-opener introduces a glam rocker who should be a better known part of pop history.</Review>
            <Review>In unexceptional fashion, Turner uses a parade of talking heads and multiple montages of grainy film clips and archival stills to paint a picture of the artist-as-chameleon.</Review>
            <Review>Jobriath's story emerges as one of rock 'n' roll's great tragedies, a tale of hubris, misery and death. One not to be missed.</Review>
            <Review>Kieran Turner's Jobriath A.D. is an admirable attempt to rescue the singer from the junk heap of failed pop culture &amp; it was obviously made with a lot of love &amp; care. However...only a sketchy impression of the artist's real personality comes through</Review>
            <Review>The film never explores the depths and nuances that could actually place Jobriath in conversation with figures who came after him, however reductively.</Review>
            <Review>Descending the penis in vain</Review>
            <Review>Fast-paced and colourful, this documentary chronicles the astonishing story of a gifted artist who never found the success everyone knew he deserved.</Review>
            <Review>Though it documents well just how unready the country was for an uncloseted superstar, it also marginalizes his output--much as the culture did 40 years ago.</Review>

            <Review>It is a fully realized love story of rare spirit, the sort of deeply affecting film that can make you laugh until you are near tears, then drive you close to bawling.</Review>
            <Review>Parents and teachers of all the Nathans out there may be inclined to give "A Brilliant Young Mind" the full four stars; for the rest of us, it's small, smart, and satisfying.</Review>
            <Review>Long after you've seen the film, you'll remember the wonderfully nuanced work of the cast, particularly Ms. Hawkins.</Review>
            <Review>A strong cast elevates this sweet British drama.</Review>
            <Review>"A Brilliant Young Mind" is less stuffy than the usual cinematic ode to British smarts and schooling. But that still can't save this tale of eccentric genius from being profoundly conventional.</Review>
            <Review>Hawkins gives a performance of remarkable grace and sensitivity.</Review>
            <Review>The touching A Brilliant Young Mind, about a teen boy with autism, features strong performances that make it more memorable than you would initially expect.</Review>
            <Review>It's pleasingly moving.</Review>
            <Review>A loss of focus turns this small English feature from an excellent film into a routine and mediocre one about half-way through, but its opening reels have touches of understated genius about them and it is full of undeniably moving moments.</Review>
            <Review>A confidently directed version of an underdog story that we've seen before.</Review>
            <Review>Matthews' direction is perfect. Yes, he manipulates you throughout, but nothing is milked, there is great subtlety, and his settings in Taiwan and at Cambridge are deftly shot by Les Miserables and The King's Speech cinematographer Danny Cohen.</Review>
            <Review>Given [that the film] is concerned with the rigid certainties of algebraic formulation, its winning formula -- mixing charm, low-key humour, on-screen chemistry and emotional delicacy -- is altogether more ineffable.</Review>

            <Review>Lee returns to engaging, enraged form with Chi-Raq, combining social commentary, anger, humour, dramatics and over-the-top style in a sometimes messy mix that uses every trick necessary to put a spotlight on America's poisonous love affair with guns.</Review>
            <Review>Lee's film is worth seeing for its bombastic excess and camo-clad dance scenes. But if you're looking for tactful visual responses to the Black Lives Matter movement and the effects of police brutality, this isn't it.</Review>
            <Review>Never subtle, always strident and absolutely necessary.</Review>
            <Review>It's messy in places, as Lee's movies tend to be. But there isn't a moment that Chi-Raq isn't alive. This is a deeply serious, biting picture that also has joy in its heart.</Review>
            <Review>You long for "Chi-Raq" to succeed. Sad to report, it's an awkward affair, stringing out its tearful scenes of mourning, and going wildly astray with its lurches into farce.</Review>
            <Review>It's sexy, brash, and potent - a powerful weapon in its own right.</Review>
            <Review>Chi-Raq may not be the most coherent critique of inner city violence or even the best film about race hitting theaters this winter ... but it is Lee's most vital work in years.</Review>
            <Review>This overlong concept-film/disquisition mostly misfires. Its heart-on-sleeve power gets muddled by its confusion of brash with blatant and politics with polemics. There's much pronouncement and protestation; docu-realism's mixed up with too-broad farce.</Review>
            <Review>There are huge swaths of 'Chi-Raq' that don't work at all, and they ultimately don't matter a lick, because the picture charges ahead with such confidence and electricity.</Review>
            <Review>Chi-Raq is raucous and transgressive, but most of all, it's a lament. And lament is exactly what we-you and I-need to learn: right now, this year, this month, this week, today.</Review>
            <Review>An unwieldy and frequently tasteless mishmash of gang violence, socioeconomics, and sexual politics.</Review>

            <Review>A swirl of gender confusion, "The New Girlfriend" tosses all the he/she/we question marks it can find in a tale of contemporary confused sexuality.</Review>
            <Review>It's less than it should've been, and a little mild. But Ozon makes it glide with confidence, in or out of heels.</Review>
            <Review>Duris in drag looks like a refugee from the New York Dolls, but his character aspires to nothing more than life as a bourgeois, pearl-clad mom.</Review>
            <Review>The New Girlfriend is a funny, delicate, subtly flavored dish deliciously prepared by François Ozon - idiosyncratic and unforgettable.</Review>
            <Review>A wildly entertaining work, one that manages to be simultaneously funny, touching, slightly unnerving and undeniably sexy to behold, regardless of where your predilections may lie.</Review>
            <Review>Although at times amorphously told and genre non-specific - Dark comedy? Soapy drama? DePalma-esque thriller? - the film holds interest as it often defies expectation and juggles its bold, complex emotions.</Review>
            <Review>While there is occasional delight of artful satire, fanciful farce, psychological undercurrent and political breadth, it soon becomes evident, as the intricate subplots and subtexts unfold, Ozon has rather overstretched himself again.</Review>
            <Review>Ozon, perhaps not entirely purposely, addresses the very timely issue of trans and non-binary gender identity, yet he does it within the framework of his usual style and preoccupations - and shortchanges neither.</Review>
            <Review>t's tempting to call this film a dark comedy-it is after all based on a novel by author Ruth Rendell-but for all the wit (and there is plenty) there is very little darkness in this playful psychological drama.</Review>
            <Review>A strong thematic undercurrent pits bourgeois social conventions against authentic self-definition and ultimate freedom to live without shame or undue social limitations.</Review>
            <Review>...an intelligent investigation of hearts that don't know quite what they want.</Review>
            <Review>Arguably reminiscent of 'camp' Ozon entries like Angel and 8 Women, this has good enough work from Duris, but is truly saved by the lovely and lively Demoustier.</Review>

            <Review>If you can endure the messy slaughter, with a body count in double digits, the plot is not without its rewards.</Review>
            <Review>What this French redo of Mario Bava's 1974 heist thriller lacks in plot it more than makes up for in flashy camerawork, energy ... Hitchcock would have cued us to the surprise twist earlier.</Review>
            <Review>This remake of Mario Bava's 1974 thriller is a serviceable time-killer that benefits from star Lambert Wilson's slow-burn performance.</Review>
            <Review>There's no reason for Rabid Dogs to exist, as even character identity and motivation receives little attention.</Review>

            <Review>The core of the story is business, the object is power, and the quirks of desire and twists of the unconscious are given no place in the struggle-which the movie sharply carries ahead to the present day.</Review>
            <Review>It's very easy to imagine sing-along showings cropping up for years to come.</Review>
            <Review>This movie about a group of risk-takers should have taken more risks itself.</Review>
            <Review>Straight Outta Compton aims to cross cultures and sanctify the wisdom of the street-to make a universal underdog story. It succeeds on a visceral level.</Review>
            <Review>Straight Outta Compton is so beholden to the appeasement of so many artists and legacies and estates that none of it coheres as a movie.</Review>
            <Review>While no one will mistake this for a protest film-there are too many pool parties-the movie's portrait of a militarized police force all too eager to assault young black men can't help but resonate in our own moment.</Review>
            <Review>It's a musical biopic in an urban warzone and we see how the culture of gangs and drugs and poverty and simmering racial conflicts shaped the group's angry message.</Review>
            <Review>Straight Outta Compton swears to tell the truth, the half-truth, and nothing but the, uh... you know the rest.</Review>
            <Review>Straight Outta Compton is at its most compelling when the band's adversaries are the authorities... But the film's energy level noticeably sags in the second half when the band are at odds with each other.</Review>
            <Review>The backdrop of Rodney King-era L.A and the realness and rawness of N.W.A.'s music, not to mention the passionate and heartfelt performances of the film's three young leads gives the film an undeniable power.</Review>
            <Review>In spite of its many formal and structural flaws, 'Straight Outta Compton' works, because it captures a moment, and positions its music at the center of that moment.</Review>
            <Review>Gangs packed military-grade weaponry, the heaviosity of gangsta rap inexorably began transmogrifying the USA into a hip-hop nation, and 'Compton' puts you right there.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>There's something powerful in that, in the simple fact that The Intern is so sympathetic to its older character-so resolutely on the side of a person who might, in other contexts, be dismissed or ignored or, as is so often the case, invisible.</Review>
            <Review>Thanks largely to performances by De Niro and Hathaway, The Intern is a gentle, enjoyable fantasy-and certainly Meyers's best film in more than a decade.</Review>
            <Review>This earnest, effusive haut-bourgeois fantasy, by the writer and director Nancy Meyers, runs roughshod over rational skepticism with the force of her life experience.</Review>
            <Review>The Intern degenerates into a series of monologues about ambition and relationships and having it all. As the speeches pile up, our goodwill dissipates, and so does the film's magic.</Review>
            <Review>In keeping everything so polite, The Intern, while being a pleasant and watchable movie, is also entirely ephemeral. Maybe that's why, like Meyers' other films, The Intern will likely be so re-watchable, too.</Review>
            <Review>There's not much here story-wise. But when Meyers wants to write an involving scene with characters thinking and feeling the way humans think and feel, you want to applaud.</Review>
            <Review>A charming and simple drama comedy with some genuine sincerity and heart to it.</Review>
            <Review>It's the kind of compulsively watchable film you'll be helpless to resist when it shows up on cable TV.</Review>
            <Review>Largely inoffensive if a bit tone oblivious, The Intern suggests a lot of experience goes a long way even in the modern business world.</Review>
            <Review>The Intern has a broader appeal with a cross-generation story staring Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro, but it retains Meyer's warm tone, upper-middle setting and dedication to immaculately decorated homes.</Review>
            <Review>Fortunately, this is a film geared towards its older characters (something Meyers ... excels at). De Niro hasn't had it so good in years.</Review>
            <Review>Easygoing, likeable and perhaps a little too safe, The Intern is not Meyers' best work to date but, it's reliable and entertaining. What more do you need?</Review>

            <Review>The editing errs on the side of longueurs, but likable people and the mise-en-scène draw you in. Somehow, even the artificiality feels heartwarming.</Review>
            <Review>Samba finds a much stronger rhythm when it stops contriving and simply shines a light on the joy and pain (and musical interludes) of lives lived in the margins.</Review>
            <Review>Unfortunately, the material flounders from the broadly farcical to the bombastically melodramatic.</Review>
            <Review>"Samba" tries to be too many things to too many people, although you can't say it doesn't have heart.</Review>
            <Review>Gainsbourg and Sy play off each other wonderfully, emphasizing how these characters relate to each other as people; their scenes together feel emotionally honest even though one can barely imagine them happening in real life.</Review>
            <Review>"Samba" is loosely plotted and is at least 20 minutes too long. It seems ready to end half a dozen times before it finally does, with ironic payoffs for Samba and Alice that are too glib to be satisfying.</Review>
            <Review>The new film by the writer-director duo behind the 2011 hit The Intouchables is not as formulaic and manipulative but it lacks the single-minded coherence that was so crucial to that film's success.</Review>
            <Review>Samba is still an entertaining and enjoyable movie, due in large part to the charm of its leads, Omar Sy and Charlotte Gainsbourg.</Review>

            <Review>Every line, every twist and every note of music feels painstakingly focus-grouped.</Review>
            <Review>For a movie about someone learning to come out of their shell, Jem and the Holograms is utterly confounding about what it even means to be authentic.</Review>
            <Review>As silly and sometimes nonsensical as it is, the movie is surprisingly sweet and well-intentioned.</Review>
            <Review>What it lacks in humor it makes up for in sheer weirdness -- it's a master class in How Did This Get Made? It feels focus-grouped to within an inch of its life, but it's so strange that it's impossible to imagine what process led us here.</Review>
            <Review>Not being part of the generation that watched the show, I can't vouch for its merits. But it's safe to say that it must be miles ahead of this wan, bloated screen version which forgoes the original's sci-fi and thriller aspects.</Review>
            <Review>Hardcore fans won't find much of the Jem they loved under the movie's achingly hip millennial trappings, while young newcomers will be left wondering what a robot has to do with a rock band.</Review>
            <Review>Somewhere at the heart of this movie is a kind of charm, despite its heart-on-sleeve quality. But who would you pitch it at?</Review>
            <Review>One forgets tweens have choir practice and like to unabashedly break out into song. They think this is normal. It's very cute. Bad for dads; I give 'Jem' three tween stars.</Review>
            <Review>An unrealistic representation of the music industry.</Review>
            <Review>This live action dud is basically what you imagine a bargain-basement Star is Born would be like if it was directed by the chap who did a Step Up sequel, a horror producer and Justin Bieber's manager.</Review>

            <Review>Powerful, exhausting, ecstatic, twisted and unerringly honest, "The Diary of a Teenage Girl" is a rare film indeed, a look at a young girl's messy coming of age told completely from the young girl's point of view.</Review>
            <Review>Writer/director Marielle Heller, in her captivating debut film "The Diary of a Teenage Girl," hits exactly the right tone for a complicated balancing act, and for a film that could very easily have gone wrong.</Review>
            <Review>"The Diary of a Teenage Girl" is a breakthrough moment in the culture in that it depicts youthful female sexuality ... not just with the unapologetic frankness the boys usually get, but with an awareness of all the places a girl's urges will take her ...</Review>
            <Review>An honest and personal and unblurred examination (even through that druggy blur) of a tricky voyage into womanhood.</Review>
            <Review>"The Diary of a Teenage Girl" is as rewarding as it is squirm-inducing for its honesty, audacity and artful portrayal of adolescence from a girl's point of view.</Review>
            <Review>Films often fail to capture the turmoil of being a teenager - but not this one.</Review>
            <Review>Dives head first in to the coming of age of a young woman, warts and all.</Review>
            <Review>The Diary of A Teenage Girl moves in a sun-drenched haze, spattered with animation, thrilling in its very mundanity. It's smart and assured and, like Minnie, knows what it wants. Astonishing.</Review>
            <Review>You'll be happy to meet the strong, smart -- and yes -- unapologetically horny teenage Minnie and, for two hours, be immersed in her world.</Review>
            <Review>She's not defined by her damage, nor her sexuality. That quality is what makes the picture revolutionary; the insight and wit of of the writing and direction and the bracing humanity of the playing are what make it great.</Review>
            <Review>It wields taboo like a cheap firecracker with a makeshift fuse, concurrently panicky and confrontational and overconfident, much like its 15 year-old lead character.</Review>
            <Review>An attractive film with lots to take in and reflect on. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>

            <Review>A charming subject goes a long way in character-study doc I Am Thor, an imperfect but energizing portrait of self-styled metal god Jon Mikl Thor.</Review>
            <Review>Striking the right good-natured tone between admiration and amusement, "I Am Thor" isn't particularly slickly or imaginatively packaged, but its straightforward DIY presentation feels apt.</Review>
            <Review>It isn't as skillfully put together as the very similar Anvil! The Story of Anvil, but it has undeniable appeal as a strange glimpse of what used to be mainstream and what is now a very small subculture.</Review>
            <Review>Highly entertaining...Thankfully, Thor's charisma is undeniable, and it's fun to watch him interact with fans and dominate the stage.</Review>
            <Review>Jon Mikl Thor is a showman and a stalwart, a flat-out legend, and I AM THOR is the often uproarious, and sometimes quite poignant, love letter he deserves.</Review>

            <Review>Sports and religion are a potent combination, one that siblings Jon and Andrew Erwin (October Baby, Mom's Night Out) exploit to canny effect in their new film based on the real-life Woodlawn High School football team.</Review>
            <Review>Until the balance tips rather too blatantly toward the latter during the final minutes, the overall narrative mix of history lesson, gridiron action and spiritual uplift is effectively and satisfyingly sustained.</Review>

            <Review>Stonewall is a movie about a pivotal moment in LGBT history as filtered through the perspective of a fictional hunk of Wonder Bread named Danny who steps off a bus from Indiana and right into a central role in the Christopher Street scene.</Review>
            <Review>The Stonewall Riots were a triumph for a marginalized community, but Emmerich fails to convey the significance of the event in any meaningful fashion. The subject matter deserves better, and so do we.</Review>
            <Review>It's a self-financed passion project, from a man who might be the most financially successful out gay filmmaker ever. We should be celebrating this, but man, oh man, does he make it difficult.</Review>
            <Review>Although handsomely crafted, well-acted and made with transparently noble intentions, Roland Emmerich's "Stonewall" is a movie that seems destined to please almost no one.</Review>
            <Review>Danny isn't all that interesting. And the sadder fact is that the filmmakers seem to know that, but worry an audience won't identify with a more flamboyant character. So they present this safer, paler alternative.</Review>
            <Review>There may be a good movie to be made about the Stonewall riots, which triggered much of the gay power movement in 1970, but "Stonewall" isn't it.</Review>
            <Review>Compared to a genuinely rousing gay-rights historical drama like Milk (2008), Stonewall falls considerably short.</Review>
            <Review>Disappointing gay-rights drama has sex, language, violence.</Review>
            <Review>Despite the volatile subject matter, Stonewall is a rather bland rendering.</Review>
            <Review>Stonewall is such a cataclysmic disaster of a film that I'm surprised nobody has called FEMA yet to help with all the damage it's done to the GLBTQ+ community.</Review>
            <Review>...spends an excruciatingly long time on a happily ever after coda (20+ minutes) about Danny and not enough of what followed after the riots.</Review>
            <Review>It's a high school play-ready version of the riots, a version more focused on outside characters and related inspiring lessons than even the riots themselves, and wears the rosest-colored glasses about the dynamics of the era in which it took place.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Established in 1960, Tower Records was once a retail powerhouse with two hundred stores, in thirty countries, on five continents. From humble beginnings in a small-town drugstore, Tower Records eventually became the heart and soul of the music world, and a powerful force in the music industry. In 1999, Tower Records made $1 billion. In 2006, the company filed for bankruptcy. What went wrong? Everyone thinks they know what killed Tower Records: The Internet. But that's not the story. 'All Things Must Pass' is a feature documentary film examining this iconic company's explosive trajectory, tragic demise, and legacy forged by its rebellious founder Russ Solomon.

            <Review>We learn of the party-hearty environment and family-like vibe of a world where it was cool to write off cocaine as a business expense. And we see the hubris and myopia that doomed the industry.</Review>
            <Review>As Bruce Springsteen says in the film, "Everybody in a record store is a little bit of your friend for 20 minutes or so." And he's right - including all the ups and downs that friendship entails.</Review>
            <Review>It's loving and lovely, but goes too easy on the hubris and greed.</Review>
            <Review>Colin Hanks makes his feature directing debut with this irresistible documentary about the evolution of the music business.</Review>
            <Review>Lively and loving ...</Review>
            <Review>The real beating heart of the film is its collection of wild war tales told by the company's former employees, who regarded Tower as more than just a paycheck gig or a commercial proposition.</Review>
            <Review>A love letter to the store and Solomon ... but also to the bygone era of music consumption before iPods and Spotify.</Review>
            <Review>Director Colin Hanks lets his affection for his subject run over. The film probably is for record aficionados only.</Review>
            <Review>Hanks found an amiable raconteur in Solomon, now 90 but sharp and focused on the business that was his life. A collection of Solomon's confidants sing his praises and get misty about how much fun they had in the old days.</Review>
            <Review>This is Tower's story, and Hanks tells in a way that will resonate with both grizzled music veterans who have hung onto their physical collections, and millennials wondering what all the fuss was about.</Review>
            <Review>Hanks makes the rookie mistake of covering the same points too thoroughly - the film could be 10 to 15 minutes shorter - but you can see why he lets entertaining interviewees ramble a bit.</Review>
            <Review>Solomon's skills as a raconteur, the employees' unabashed love for their work, and the constant stream of rock music playing in the background advance the film into something much more than a talking-heads documentary.</Review>

            <Review>For all the natural spectacle, the characters are what hold one's attention.</Review>
            <Review>"Everest," in short, suffers from the same problem as Everest: overcrowding.</Review>
            <Review>Unlike many mountain-disaster stories, this is the kind that makes you never want to look at a mountain again.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately, "Everest" is an achievement of production, capturing the landscape in striking IMAX cinematography. It's also the compelling tale of mountains and the people who feel the need to conquer them, or be conquered in the process.</Review>
            <Review>A white-knuckle survival film with an outstanding cast.</Review>
            <Review>Everest takes an inordinate amount of time to get the pieces in place. However, once the group departs base camp and begins the ascent, the film sloughs off its slow pace and transforms into a gripping tale of survival, life, and death.</Review>
            <Review>This is a tale of hubris and tragedy, a reminder that pushing oneself solely for the point of pushing oneself is not a particularly good use of one's time on this planet.</Review>
            <Review>Everest's uncanny realism is a big part of what keeps you in its icy thrall.</Review>
            <Review>Stomach-turning 3-D puts you right over the black, bottomless crevasses on a shaky metal ladder. You may wish (like some of the climbers) that you hadn't come on this trip.</Review>
            <Review>The film skillfully balances seriousness and spectacle, its surplus of rousing action beats ensuring that no one regrets the IMAX 3D surcharge.</Review>
            <Review>In the end, it's perhaps Mother Nature that gives the best performance; she's never been more majestic on film.</Review>
            <Review>A beautifully captured tale of bravery, human spirit and a battle for survival set against a gorgeous yet a merciless backdrop of the tallest mountain in the world.</Review>

            <Review>It may not do full justice to all [of its] subjects in its tight 78 minutes, but it's not a film you're likely to forget.</Review>
            <Review>The liberation footage itself is the centerpiece of Night Will Fall. It is mesmerizing, sickening, disturbing, and essential.</Review>
            <Review>Horrifying. Fascinating.</Review>
            <Review>A masterfully constructed, eye-opening and, at times, eyes-averting look at an obscure chapter of Holocaust history.</Review>
            <Review>This wise, sober new documentary is a reminder of historical horrors, but it's also a tale of censorship.</Review>
            <Review>Night is brisk but surprisingly comprehensive. It also further burnishes Hitchcock's reputation and gives Bernstein his long overdue acknowledgment.</Review>
            <Review>Night Will Fall is an unsparing yet unfortunately necessary reminder of the atrocities committed seventy plus years ago.</Review>
            <Review>As "Night Will Fall" shows, even in the darkest hour, sometimes the greatest heroes are those willing to stare bravely into humanity's worst depths and tell the world what happened.</Review>
            <Review>As well as footage of Bernstein, Singer has some fascinating interviews with English, Soviet and American soldiers who did the filming.</Review>
            <Review>After 70 years in the can... some of the most visceral, detailed and shocking footage of the liberation of Nazi concentration camps is being released.</Review>
            <Review>Impressively sober, thoughtful ...</Review>
            <Review>It is difficult to imagine that there'll be a more important film this year. Don't miss it.</Review>

            <Review>Paul describes a song he likes as existing "between euphoria and melancholia," which is the balance the movie he's in strikes as well, as interested in joy as it is in loss. Which may be the best thing these stories of not making it bring to the table.</Review>
            <Review>While Hansen-Love hits the major chords in Paul's life effectively and creates a sense of time expanding before collapsing into memory, the truth is "Eden" is often tiring to sit through.</Review>
            <Review>Eden is the kind of movie that hits you when you least expect it. Just when I thought it was a mess, its aimlessness began to make complete sense.</Review>
            <Review>Perhaps what Hansen-Løve lacks is perspective. The movie runs a very long two hours and 11 minutes, and the excess is easily felt.</Review>
            <Review>In the realm of disco lights and thumping bass lines, mounting debt, hungover mornings and interchangeable sleeping partners, there's a real love story here about a man and his passion for his loops and beats.</Review>
            <Review>Eden finds paradise where it counts: right between the ears.</Review>
            <Review>An impressive and suprisingly melancholy look at repetition in life, soundtracked by the recursive music of the French Touch scene.</Review>
            <Review>Only in retrospect could I understand Eden's careful delineation of temporal, emotional, and geographic properties:.</Review>
            <Review>[Eden] does, however, offer an intriguing insider's view of an important musical subculture, an insider's view that, crucially, remains rooted in the all-too-relatable reality from which the music itself is designed to offer temporary escape.</Review>
            <Review>The drama occurs only fleetingly and Greta Gerwig's cameo as one of Paul's flames is stilted.</Review>
            <Review>Where the early scenes of Eden feel on the nose, the back half is filled with precisely the sorts of glancing-yet-wounding blows that are Hansen-Love's specialty.</Review>
            <Review>Like going to a club sober.</Review>

            <Review>"Learning to Drive" is precisely the sort of adult-themed, intelligent and heartfelt film it wants to be, with Clarkson and Kingsley wonderfully on point.</Review>
            <Review>Learning to Drive is a story of companionship, loneliness, resilience. It's a small, artfully crafted thing, but it resonates in big ways.</Review>
            <Review>Together, [Kingsley and Clarkson] have so much to learn, and the operation of an automobile provides so many opportunities for metaphor.</Review>
            <Review>It's a beautifully acted tale of friendship, and about how sometimes, you just need to move forward - in a car, or otherwise.</Review>
            <Review>"Learning to Drive" would be an entirely inert expedition were it not for Clarkson, who plays against Kingsley's sentinel of propriety with her signature radiance and birdlike gracefulness.</Review>
            <Review>The film also provides an interesting view into Sikh culture, illustrating in colorful detail the various rituals that inform the devout driving instructor's personal life.</Review>
            <Review>An unremarkable but endearing film.</Review>
            <Review>Clarkson, in particular, is spot-on; her character unfolds gradually into the serenity that comes with hard-earned self-sufficiency. And the gentle, low-key humour belies some spiky observations about multicultural America.</Review>
            <Review>It's a gentle, uneventful film with a fair amount of charm ...</Review>
            <Review>There's nothing wrong with its signals but the manoeuvres still need L-plates.</Review>
            <Review>This is a low key but witty and often affecting film with excellent performances from Clarkson and Kingsley.</Review>
            <Review>Given little to work with, Thelma Schoonmaker edits proficiently and there's a pleasing Indian-inspired score, but the film strains so hard to be equitable that it fails to engage.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2015</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>89</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Filmed over 211 shoot days in nine countries and five continents over four years, This Changes Everything is an epic attempt to re-imagine the vast challenge of climate change. Inspired by Naomi Klein's international non-fiction bestseller This Changes Everything, the film presents seven powerful portraits of communities on the front lines, from Montana's Powder River Basin to the Alberta Tar Sands, from the coast of South India to Beijing and beyond. Interwoven with these stories of struggle is Klein's narration, connecting the carbon in the air with the economic system that put it there. Throughout the film, Klein builds to her most controversial and exciting idea: that we can seize the existential crisis of climate change to transform our failed economic system into something radically better.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Despite Everything's desire to distance itself from other climate change ventures, these early stories are perhaps the most conventionally structured for a documentary, and also the most engaging.</Review>
            <Review>Klein and those impassioned protesters provide something that has been in short supply in the predecessors - namely, a modicum of hope for the future.</Review>
            <Review>The evenly wrought film accessibly argues that runaway capitalism and short-term economic growth at all costs has caused an imminent catastrophe, and that global warming is the hot-foot instigator for a radical change in economic thinking.</Review>
            <Review>It distinguishes itself among similar planet-loving docs by showing evidence there is hope in what can often seem an overwhelming bleak task to begin repairs to an industrial-damaged world.</Review>
            <Review>If, as many seem to believe, we are presiding over the possible annihilation of our species, then maybe we need a kick in the pants more than a reassuring hug.</Review>
            <Review>An unsettling but ultimately encouraging documentary about global warming and grassroots activism.</Review>
            <Review>Riveting climate-change docu encourages grassroots action.</Review>
            <Review>Klein and husband/director Avi Lewis can't make a rhetorically strong enough case for the central idea... so they fire up the waterworks and hope you'll feel bad enough to let them have their way.</Review>
            <Review>By failing to address basic issues, This Changes Everything comes off as misleading at best, deliberately confusing at worst.</Review>
            <Review>It's sometimes boring, it makes assumptions about its audience.</Review>
            <Review>Klein is an excellent synthesizer of difficult ideas and knows how to make them accessible.</Review>
            <Review>This Changes Everything isn't a game-changer, but it is jarring enough to be scary.</Review>

            <Review>As a movie, this material, freely adapted by Stoppard, is boring and endless. It lies flat on the screen, hardly stirring.</Review>

            <Review>There comes a point when you have to say no to these horror sequels. There's no skill or idea visible anywhere, just the sound of money being sucked from your pockets.</Review>
            <Review>Although Sinister 2 continues the story begun in Scott Derrickson's creepily effective Sinister, it feels more like an unnecessary retread than an organic extension of the original.</Review>
            <Review>Creepy kids and sick jokes make for meager scares, but Ransone is likable as the film's beleaguered hero.</Review>
            <Review>This sequel, as rough as it is, might be more worthwhile than its 2012 original.</Review>
            <Review>Nothing in Sinister 2 comes across as believably scary.</Review>
            <Review>Nothing about "Sinister 2" comes close to the feel-bad ode to literally and figuratively dark interiors that distinguished the title-earning original.</Review>
            <Review>If ever there was a perfect example of the misguided nature of the film sequel, Sinister 2 is it. You can commend a sequel for trying to build on and expand the original, but this film seems to have regressed.</Review>
            <Review>In a film where ghostly children attempt to force other kids to watch horror movies only to be repeatedly told "I don't' want to", this somehow manages to be a microcosm for Sinister 2. I don't want to watch any more either.</Review>
            <Review>"Sinister 2" depends greatly on cheap scares.</Review>
            <Review>A lackluster follow up to what was a fairly unimpressive horror entry.</Review>
            <Review>Whilst Sinister 2 at least manages to avoid being a mere re-tread, the final product comes off as decidedly flat.</Review>
            <Review>Ciarán Foy provides a further link to the first film by resolutely failing to generate any decent scares.</Review>

            <Review>Damon has never seemed more at home than he does here, millions of miles adrift. Would any other actor have shouldered the weight of the role with such diligent grace?</Review>
            <Review>It's pretty sunny and often funny, a space oddity for a director not known for pictures with a sense of humor.</Review>
            <Review>Bringing optimism, nerd-itude and a touch of crazy to his character's solo ordeal -- at one point, scraggly Watney calls himself a "space pirate" -- Damon is the key to the movie's exuberance.</Review>
            <Review>The film is a profound testament to the rare-and underrated-virtue of simply not screwing anything up.</Review>
            <Review>The Martian plays to both Scott's strengths and weaknesses. By relegating Mark's predicament to a purely survivalist scenario, he keeps things humming along without ever widening the horizon. But there was an obligation to widen the horizon.</Review>
            <Review>It's a brisk, funny piece of competence-porn sci-fi.</Review>
            <Review>Director Ridley Scott and screenwriter Drew Goddard have managed to turn a series of math equations into exciting filmed entertainment.</Review>
            <Review>... the rare science fiction drama that is actually built on applied physics and engineering and organic chemistry and where survival depends on creative problem solving and teamwork across millions of miles.</Review>
            <Review>Sir Ridley Scott's The Martian is a thoroughly entertaining epic that easily ranks as one of the best films of 2015, and as the director's best film since 2000's Gladiator.</Review>
            <Review>I have no idea if the science in The Martian is accurate. It sure felt accurate, which is all that matters in a way. On top of being wildly entertaining, the film is about using your wits to overcome seemingly insurmountable odds.</Review>
            <Review>You may discover hearing songs that normally provoke in you a knee-jerk flailing at whatever source is playing them ('Turn it off!!!') will here make you feel strangely happy.</Review>
            <Review>The Martian is to moviegoers of today what 2001: A Space Odyssey was to audiences in 1968.... But Scott's rendition is more light-hearted and nerdy, and he clearly relishes every minute of the project.</Review>

            <Review>All the elements of the story fit impeccably together for a humorous and occasionally wrenching examination of relationships.</Review>
            <Review>The characters are so accustomed to keeping up appearances that they can't bring themselves to say what's bugging them. Their interactions may be mild, but the claustrophobic imagery creates the sense of being trapped in a powder keg.</Review>
            <Review>Though hardly revolutionary, "Mother" subverts conventions - both cinematic and social.</Review>
            <Review>The Second Mother is an interesting look at generational and class divides in Brazil, without the feel of a lecture or lesson.</Review>
            <Review>We've seen plenty of stories about the arrival of a mysterious stranger upsetting the order of things. But "The Second Mother," Brazilian writer and director Anna Muylaert's outstanding film, is different.</Review>
            <Review>The characters' pigeonholed social roles display Muylaert's intentions from the start and render the drama superfluous.</Review>
            <Review>In Anna Muylaert's domestic drama ... the outcome is small but significant, a well-earned and thought-out riposte via a strong ensemble cast that gives contradictory meaning to the idea of knowing your place.</Review>
            <Review>What I find noteworthy about this film is that you don't fully realise its power until the ending. It subtly unfolds</Review>
            <Review>This is a film in which the minutia matters as we become engrossed in the divergent worlds of the domestic and her employers</Review>
            <Review>Full of irony and drama, this Brazilian film is a subtle approach to social art. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>

            <Review>Irrational Man is turgid to the point of ridiculousness and absurdly anachronistic ...</Review>
            <Review>After a late wobble or two, Irrational Man packs a final, farcical punch that feels just right.</Review>
            <Review>At the age of 79, Woody Allen is still a formidable filmmaker ("Blue Jasmine" was just two years ago). But he is also, inevitably, Woody Allen.</Review>
            <Review>It works, more or less; the three central actors are all terrific, particularly Posey, who finds something vulnerable and touching in Rita. But you watch it thinking of other, better Allen movies ...</Review>
            <Review>In the end, this feeble effort remains tainted, however unfairly, by the creator's personal life. Maybe Allen should have titled it "Rationalizing Man."</Review>
            <Review>While it doesn't quite succeed, it's a mournful meditation too sharp and smart to dislike.</Review>
            <Review>As is often the case with Allen's narratives, the morality issues at work here reflect what seems to be the director's own conviction -- that conventional standards of good and evil should not be imposed on brilliant people like Abe... or himself.</Review>
            <Review>It's a picture so dire, its problems so base and elementary, that I'm honestly not sure Allen still has good ones in him.</Review>
            <Review>It won't surprise anyone looking for something new from Allen, but you can find some of the themes in his other work with a different focus. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>It's the Woodman's worst since Melinda and Melinda.</Review>

Nobody in town would think to implicate John - nobody but Danny (Ronnie Gene Blevens), Dutch's violent drunk of a brother. John's nephew Ben (Alex Moffat) arrives from Chicago on an impromptu trip to his hometown as his uncle struggles to evade Danny's growing suspicions and looming threats. In this masterfully acted tale of small-town intrigue, one man's need for revenge may cost many more their lives. - (C) FilmBuff</StoryLine>

            <Review>The movie's small, but Ashton keeps us watching and listening.</Review>
            <Review>The kind of polished, understated throb in the temple that gives independent, low-budget filmmaking a good reputation. Uncle John is meticulously observed and startlingly good.</Review>
            <Review>The two mostly unrelated stories culminate in a climactic crosscutting of sex and violence that borders on farcical.</Review>
            <Review>"Uncle John" is so subtle, so exquisitely paced and so determined not to go in any of the obvious directions that it's hard to believe the film is Steven Piet's first feature.</Review>
            <Review>Thanks to Ashton's brilliant, career-defining performance, we're made to see that the only thing worse than doing evil deeds is being nice enough to feel guilty about them.</Review>
            <Review>Ashton has worked steadily for years, but with Uncle he finally gets a career-defining role, flat-out knocking it out of the park with his quiet, slow-boiling performance.</Review>
            <Review>[Steven Piet] has masterfully interwoven multiple genres into one tightly crafted, surprising little film.</Review>
            <Review>Uncle John is an audacious combination of genres: a slow-burning mystery-thriller mixed with a mumblecore love story. There's a dash of morbid comedy thrown in for good measure, too.</Review>
            <Review>This is a truly special film that is intent on taking the road less travelled.</Review>
            <Review>For a first film, it's very assured filmmaking, and from here Piet and Crary could choose to go in either direction "Uncle John" points to - or any direction, really.</Review>
            <Review>Overall, a very impressive piece.</Review>
            <Review>This may be the only time I've wanted to see a director's cut where there's less material.</Review>

            <Review>Every scene weighs on the audience. But Oppenheimer and Adi manage to locate a lightness as well that lessens the burden.</Review>
            <Review>"The Look of Silence" is so disturbing because so few people in it seem disturbed.</Review>
            <Review>A reminder that the architects of a massive tragedy remain present and unrepentant, the personification of the evil men do and a warning that it could happen again.</Review>
            <Review>Killing focused on the surreal reenactment of mass genocide by its elderly perpetrators. Silence makes it personal.</Review>
            <Review>The Look of Silence couldn't possibly equal its predecessor, but it's still a wrenching and unforgettable experience.</Review>
            <Review>"The Look of Silence" is painful and unforgettable - a serious and honorable form, perhaps the highest, of "gotcha" journalism imaginable.</Review>
            <Review>The anemic excuses for participating in mass murder are sickeningly familiar, e.g., "I was just carrying out orders." Name a genocide, and these kinds of justifications bloom like wildflowers in an Indonesian jungle.</Review>
            <Review>While entering the minds of the perpetrators in The Act of Killing was motivated by action, looking at the legacy of genocide through the eyes of its survivors drives The Look of Silence.</Review>
            <Review>It only takes a few minutes to fully comprehend how The Look of Silence is complementing and expanding the subject, and why Oppenheimer is not letting this go.</Review>
            <Review>It's a film that shows how weak and fragile memory is, and how the mind is powerful enough to suppress the greatest horror.</Review>
            <Review>Oppenheimer turns his [Act of Killing] camera around, in a sense, to examine how the Indonesian genocide impacted those who survived...</Review>
            <Review>Don't get it twisted, The Look of Silence will disturb you...</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2015</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>64</Duration>
        <StoryLine>In the year 2000, Les Blank, along with co-filmmaker Gina Leibrecht, visited Richard Leacock (1921-2011) at his farm in Normandy, France and recorded conversations with him about his life, his work, and his other passion: cooking! With the flair of a seasoned raconteur, Leacock recounts key moments in his seventy years as a filmmaker and the innovations that he, D.A. Pennebaker, Albert Maysles and others invented that revolutionized documentary filmmaking, and explores the mystery of creativity. With the passing of both Blank and Leacock, the documentary is a moving insight into the lives of two seminal figures in the history of film.</StoryLine>

            <Review>The ordinariness of this film-and the flatness of its video-shot images, relative to Blank's beautiful-looking '70s films-isn't a significant drawback, given how eloquent Leacock can be.</Review>
            <Review>The great documentarian Les Blank died in 2013 - two years after his mentor, Richard Leacock - but both are warmly present in this set of interviews Blank did with his teacher in France 15 years ago.</Review>
            <Review>Like Mr. Leacock's other films, it helps give the "feeling of being there" that he strove for.</Review>
            <Review>Fitfully captivating, though plenty amusing.</Review>
            <Review>Provides a leisurely, insightful history of documentaries that parallels the filmmaker's biography, done in the style he championed, by Les Blank, who he greatly influenced.</Review>
            <Review>Engaging look at Ricky Leacock from his friend Les Blank marks a valedictory for both filmmakers.</Review>
            <Review>A definitive reflection on the work of two great directors and the specific slices of cinema they so fruitfully cultivated.</Review>

            <Review>Those seeking closure to what continuity there has been will go home mostly disappointed.</Review>

            <Review>At its most basic level, the "Paranormal Activity" formula still has some kick, with its combination of creepy lo-fi video and tasteful suburbia creating some strong, unsettling dissonance.</Review>
            <Review>Paranormal Activity's shtick has clearly run its course.</Review>
            <Review>As far as the greatly anticipated reveals, they're a little underwhelming too, although sure to give fans the payoff they need so they can put this franchise to bed.</Review>
            <Review>This movie can go to hell.</Review>
            <Review>As the supposed last entry to the multimillion dollar haunted-house-found-footage franchise created by Oren Peli back in 2007, Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension is surprisingly indifferent and unsurprisingly ineffective.</Review>
            <Review>The film is Blumhouse through and through, preferencing technical innovation and ingenuity over big budgets.</Review>
            <Review>It's sad to see a series that started with such a bang go out with such a whimper. But it's better than wringing a seventh movie from this tired old formula.</Review>

            <Review>"Hotel Transylvania 2" is an unfortunate throwback to about 20 years ago, when animated movies were more widely accepted as cinematic babysitters.</Review>
            <Review>Hotel Transylvania 2 is the greatest movie Adam Sandler and Kevin James have ever made together. I believe this is called "damning with faint praise."</Review>
            <Review>So much attention has been paid to crafting a relentless string of in-jokes meant for ancient horror fans that the storyline limps from tired blood.</Review>
            <Review>Yes, every joke in the film is low-hanging fruit, but not a single one is left unpicked.</Review>
            <Review>The onslaught [of gags] isn't painful, but neither does it do much to distract from the ho-hum story.</Review>
            <Review>This subpar sequel barely comes close to being as amusing as any run-of-the-mill "Munsters" TV episode.</Review>
            <Review>All of these exertions are just enough to graze the 90 minute mark, after which the film gratefully whumps to a close taking its paint-by-numbers character arcs and hopelessly generic jokes with it.</Review>
            <Review>There are few things as sad as an unkept promise, Hotel Transylania 2 does that for movies. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>With a joke well that runs dry nearly an hour too early, watches will be checked and previously unwanted popcorn kernels will be rigorously examined.</Review>
            <Review>A rip-roaring monster ball finale, complete with a whopping great punch-up featuring Dracula, Frankenstein, werewolves and bats, more than makes up for the flaws.</Review>
            <Review>Light on intelligent humour, heavy on the slapstick, the result is once again a mixed bag; an animated effort which will please the young viewers, but not anyone older than maybe 10.</Review>
            <Review>Still, the material is a lot stronger than anything in the premise-squandering Pixels or lackluster Paul Blart sequel.</Review>

        <Duration>90</Duration>
        <StoryLine>A snowy New York City night, a beloved teacher, a shocking crime: this provocative drama pieces together the puzzle of a man's life just before it changes forever. While on his way home one evening, Walter Zarrow (Sam Waterston), a popular Columbia University philosophy professor, is violently attacked on the street. Flash back one week, as actor-director Tim Blake Nelson traces the domino effect of events that led up to this seemingly senseless assault. Along the way, hidden connections between a seemingly disparate group of people-including a self-destructive student (Kristen Stewart), a hard-drinking suburban housewife (Gretchen Mol), and a desperate junkie (K. Todd Freeman)-emerge, forming a complex, engrossing mosaic of lost souls united by tragedy. The stellar ensemble cast includes Glenn Close and Michael K. Williams.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Stewart stands out because her one big scene seems so passionate and genuine. It's the only moment when "Anesthesia" seems to be working.</Review>
            <Review>A grand gesture going nowhere.</Review>

            <Review>I want to recommend Nelson's film in spite of how misconceived it is simply because it asks interesting questions, albeit in some of the most banal ways imaginable.</Review>

        <Duration>89</Duration>
        <StoryLine>A hunt for buried treasure sends two men on a surprising comic caper in this Cannes prize-winning charmer from acclaimed director Corneliu Porumboiu (Police, Adjective; 12:08 East of Bucharest). Costi (Cuzin Toma) is a workaday family man whose cash-strapped next-door neighbor (Adrian Purcarescu) makes him an intriguing proposition: help him find the fortune reportedly buried somewhere on the grounds of his family's country home and split the profits. But as the two men dig, they unearth more than they bargained for, excavating not only dirt, but traces of Romania's often tumultuous history. Part modern day fable, part profound social commentary,The Treasure confirms Porumboiu's status as "one of our great contemporary observers of the human comedy" (Variety).</StoryLine>

            <Review>Slowly ... something changes, and the functionality of Porumboui's style gives way to an ever-so-slight hint of wonder.</Review>
            <Review>It's good absurdist stuff, a little reminiscent of the work of Aki Kaurismäki, albeit without that filmmaker's wooly-headed whimsy.</Review>
            <Review>Deadpan, determinedly low key and deeply absurd, the films of Corneliu Porumboiu are very much a particular taste, and "The Treasure" is no different.</Review>
            <Review>This charmer is determinedly mundane and low-key, until an unexpected finale transforms it.</Review>
            <Review>"The Treasure" is like the work of Samuel Beckett's long-lost Balkan cousin - bleak, stoic and suffused with a flinty, exasperated empathy for its ridiculous characters.</Review>
            <Review>A film that recalls the clarity of the parable or children's story in its unadorned yet subtly suggestive narrative.</Review>
            <Review>[A] tightly focused, minimalist and enchantingly humane story of individual struggle within the broader social reality of contemporary Romania.</Review>
            <Review>These recent Romanian films have sometimes been gloomy about both past and future, but The Treasure sprinkles a little sugar in the medicine.</Review>
            <Review>As the title suggests, there are rewards in this slight but consistently amusing gem.</Review>
            <Review>A less artful version of A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence - though it may help to be Romanian.</Review>
            <Review>"The Treasure" suggests that you can have both feet of clay and flights of fancy, and in the battle between the prosaic and the pie-eyed, the prosaic doesn't always have to win.</Review>

            <Review>You might be forgiven for expecting either an unfairly squelched masterpiece or an unholy mess. The movie is neither, although it falls closer to the mess side of the table.</Review>
            <Review>Under Mikael Håfström's visually clunky, rhythmless direction, it's a snooze of epic sameness: choppy action scenes, a blankly stern Cusack, and too many allegiance shifts to count or care for.</Review>
            <Review>It is hampered by weak writing and a badly executed story line.</Review>
            <Review>Director Mikael Hafstrom and a fine cast and crew have made a film that's elegant and gauche in roughly equal measure.</Review>

            <Review>Written by the talented Hossein Amini and clearly inspired by spy and detective movies of the 1940s, this seems to have been a labor of love. But SHANGHAI is so convoluted that it eventually becomes lost.</Review>

            <Review>It's all intriguing and breathtaking, along with a mournful, lovely score by Klaus Badelt, but not enough to compensate for the miserable writing.</Review>
            <Review>Cusack does his best to evoke compassion for his character, and he is quick on his feet, whether trying to woo Anna, or outsmart his captors. But none of it is enough to highly recommend "Shanghai".</Review>

            <Review>Cynics may scoff at the fact that Infinitely Polar Bear glosses some of the filmmaker's darker memories, but they'll need an ice bucket handy if they intend to avoid its warmth altogether.</Review>
            <Review>Ruffalo is generally wonderful at finding the tone and mood of a character and holding to it; here he has to bounce about, but again he latches onto a consistent energy that makes Cameron a singular life force.</Review>
            <Review>"Infinitely Polar Bear" is a much-needed reminder that the realm of film is still a place to encounter something other than comic-book scenarios.</Review>
            <Review>Forbes' sweetness of tone and wise casting makes "Infinitely Polar Bear" irresistible.</Review>
            <Review>It's ultimately a feel-good movie with some poignant moments ...</Review>
            <Review>Deeply personal and filled with love, Maya Forbes' Infinitely Polar Bear is nonetheless a hard movie to watch - hard to watch comfortably.</Review>
            <Review>Accessible, entertaining and well acted.</Review>
            <Review>Writer/director Maya Forbes' autobiographical fingerprints are all over Infinitely Polar Bear, a disarmingly joyful recollection of being raised by her bipolar father in the 1970s...yet the film feels universal.</Review>
            <Review>Infinitely Polar Bear features an endearing turn by Mark Ruffalo and will bring a smile to your face.</Review>
            <Review>First-timer Forbes's earnest resolve to demystify bipolar disorder prevents her film from establishing a satisfying story arc. Ruffalo is good though.</Review>
            <Review>As is the way in these Sundance movies, there are moments of beauty, nothing much happens, and at one point somebody runs through the woods.</Review>
            <Review>Forbes' drama is very moving and has great compassion for Cameron, without turning him into some sort of saint or excusing him for his recklessness.</Review>

            <Review>Mostly playful if occasionally pretentious ...</Review>
            <Review>There are a few feints at considerations of human nature, and a word is spoken in defense of obedience, but the film serves better to start a conversation than to draw a conclusion.</Review>
            <Review>Fascinating work by Michael Almereyda, a mix of audacious artifice, ruminations and reality.</Review>
            <Review>Peter Sarsgaard carries this engaging biopic of Stanley Milgram.</Review>
            <Review>When you have such a provocative foundation and such rich material to work with, pushing it to the next level isn't necessarily the best choice.</Review>
            <Review>"Experimenter's" most striking quality is the way it encourages us to think deeply, from the first frame to the last, even if it's just to consider what on Earth an elephant is doing on screen.</Review>
            <Review>Tries to avoid the cliches of biopics but lacks spark and cleverness. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>... one of the best and most overlooked films of the year ...</Review>
            <Review>It is rather encouraging to see a film as ambitiously cerebral as Experimenter let loose in theaters.</Review>
            <Review>The result is a meaty film that misses the meat of its subject. It doesn't really grapple with its own ideas and is closer to a cinematic curio than a memorable movie.</Review>
            <Review>The movie's unsettling depiction of our capacity for cruelty makes it essential viewing.</Review>
            <Review>Impressive in its refusal to obey formal convention but less thrilling as intellectual legwork to which Milgram dedicated his life.</Review>

            <Review>An unhinged horror comedy ...</Review>
            <Review>The director and his stars commit to the insanity of their project.</Review>
            <Review>In between the rampant four-letter words and the occasional partial nudity are likable attempts at humor - some sweet, some saucy.</Review>
            <Review>It won't carry fans of "Shaun of the Dead" or "Army of Darkness" into unexplored territory, but it's energetic enough to slap a stupid grin on your face.</Review>
            <Review>For everyone already inclined to see a heavy-metal-themed New Zealand horror-comedy called Deathgasm, here's some good news: The movie is exactly what it promises to be.</Review>
            <Review>A pretty crazy film that ends up being a failed mix of ideas that never know how to deal with all of its excesses. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>"Deathgasm" is perhaps too busy for its own good and not always seamlessly plotted but the movie's infectious sensibilities are hard to deny.</Review>
            <Review>Deathgasm is gloriously low-brow, yet insightful (such a fine line to walk and yet, Jason Lei Howden makes it look easy here), and the comedic strokes throughout the script are absolute gold.</Review>
            <Review>It's the rare over-the-top horror show that's also brimming with heart. Even if that heart is being ripped from somebody's chest.</Review>
            <Review>Deathgasm drips with classic splatter film goodness. If you're on board, then the little issues won't detract from this darkly fun, unique little film.</Review>
            <Review>With its localized demonic outbreak, Deathgasm plays a bit like Demons or Evil Dead, but with the energetic, lighthearted appeal (and splattery gore) of Dead Alive and the clueless fanboy heroism of Wayne's World or even Beavis and Butthead.</Review>

            <Review>Gorgeously made, with a set piece taking place in tunnels underneath the border that conveys chaos without ever looking incoherent and a throbbing Jóhann Jóhannsson score that's the sound of very bad things on the horizon.</Review>
            <Review>An unforgettable motion picture that should be on the must-see list for anyone who appreciates films that deal in grays rather than blacks and whites.</Review>
            <Review>By the end, it packs a death stare so potent it will make you want to turn a blind eye to the shadowy brutality of its real-world horrors.</Review>
            <Review>Succeeds in evoking the anarchic violence of the drug wars raging on both sides of the U.S.-Mexican border.</Review>
            <Review>Within this dark epic of American failure lives an effective but decidedly minor vigilante flick.</Review>
            <Review>Far from being just another crime story, "Sicario" is cinema at its most ambitious.</Review>
            <Review>A taut procedural thriller tinged with the trappings of the horror and war genres ... Sicario is one of the best films of the year.</Review>
            <Review>Immaculately made, and boasting one of 2015's greatest performances; but there is, ultimately, a limit to how artistically meaningful something so fixated on agony can possibly be.</Review>
            <Review>'Sicario' is 'Traffic' on steroids; lots of bad cartel hombres. The FBI's naïve, the CIA's hydrochloric acid-cynical, Delta Force is brutal. Dude film with a killer cast-fun!</Review>
            <Review>Some pieces of the puzzle do come together eventually, but be warned, there is no light at the end of this particular tunnel of darkness.</Review>
            <Review>It's a thoughtful film, but also a visceral and affecting one, capturing the intensity of these raids and encounters.</Review>
            <Review>A riveting thriller led by the compelling performances of flinty Emily Blunt... a never-better Benicio del Toro as Alejandro, a enigmatically shady character who is part of a covert operation headed by Josh Brolin into which Blunt is seconded.</Review>

            <Review>The conclusion hatched by Adkins' frequent collaborator, director Isaac Florentine, is as inevitable as the film's basic-cable destiny.</Review>
            <Review>It's as unsubtle as a boot to the head, but its dour-and-campy lo-fi style is far preferable to the spastic flash of its big-budget genre compatriots.</Review>
            <Review>Whilst Close Range doesn't reach dizzying heights of B-movie madness, there's still a lot of fun to be had.</Review>
            <Review>Once Adkins and Florentine get their engines rumbling, "Close Range" manages to deliver some compelling combat sequences, blasting, kicking, and stabbing its way through a southwestern war zone.</Review>
            <Review>Makes use of every room in the country house and every rock in the country mountains. Adkins gets more acrobatic as the movie progresses, like he's building up to the big jumps, but he still does plenty of fancy footwork and fistwork.</Review>

            <Review>The problem, alas, is that Mara and Oyelowo are ultimately captive in a script that doesn't allow its characters to stretch outside their preordained boundaries.</Review>
            <Review>The film's police-procedural action is unimaginatively presented, but Oyelowo is compelling ...</Review>
            <Review>For a movie about purpose, "Captive" never finds its own.</Review>
            <Review>The film's reluctance to overinvest in its religious significance will certainly not satisfy the spiritual nor will it come as a welcome relief to the skeptical, placing the overall audience in a state of limbo.</Review>

            <Review>How does an actor depict something as ineffable and internal as undergoing a spiritual awakening? Mara does it with only the darting of her eyes and the slowing of her breath, and it's an extraordinary moment that should be remembered come Oscar time.</Review>

            <Review>It's a quirky life-lessons setup that, while occasionally earning deadpan laughs, tries for but never achieves Wes Anderson's patented mixture of the archly witty and the sneakily emotional.</Review>
            <Review>It's a comedy afraid of being too funny lest its macho sentimentality seem even more ridiculous than it is, and a drama afraid of appearing too serious lest you dismiss it as hogwash.</Review>

            <Review>Will make you want to punch the nearest teenage boy in the face.</Review>
            <Review>As horror, "Scouts Guide" is too frivolous to thrill. As comedy, it leans too much on scenes that see the teens groping big-breasted topless zombies or the beasties sexually molesting young girls.</Review>
            <Review>The gags are mostly puerile and uninspired - like the film was dreamed up by a bunch of tired, wired 13-year-olds; it has their insistence but little of their invention.</Review>
            <Review>After decades of well-trodden zombie tropes, a successful zombie movie has to be at least one of three things: a) original b) funny or c) actually scary. Scouts Guide To The Zombie Apocalypse doesn't earn a merit badge in any one of those categories.</Review>
            <Review>It's the best public relations boost Scouting has had since it ended its ban on gay leaders, not to mention a pretty decent zombie film.</Review>
            <Review>It's all too dumb and ribald for most tastes, but if you liked all the zombie comedies that came before, well, here's another one.</Review>
            <Review>Scouts offers a few laughs and some nicely gooey practical effects, but there's really not a lot to recommend it.</Review>
            <Review>Fails to breathe new life into the zombie genre.</Review>
            <Review>Scouts dances a mostly successful line in splatter gore and gross-out humour, [earning] itself a sleeve-full of merit badges.</Review>
            <Review>Zombie Apocalypse is as dumb as a box of rocks, and as spectacularly violent as you'd expect.</Review>
            <Review>If comedy horror that mines silliness and genitals for humour is your idea of hell, this will bring you close to suffering. But if you're a fan of the genre, I think you might rather like it.</Review>
            <Review>Of course the movie lacks any sort of logic, but why does that matter if we've never seen an actual zombie horde? Better to enjoy the action and forget that it's not supposed to be a work of art. [Full Review in Spanish]</Review>

        <Duration>78</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Seventeen-year-old Ayoub (Ayoub Elasri) has a lot on his plate: his father (Chaib Massaoudi) is a junkie, his mother (Elsie de Brauw) is a lonely divorc�, and his sister (Olivia Lonsdale) is falling in with the wrong crowd. Haunted by his father's terrible reputation, Ayoub can't get the attention of Laura (Sigrid ten Napel), the most beautiful girl in the neighborhood. He does, however, gain the attention of Kalpa (Freddy Tratlehner), an eccentric, purple Lamborghini-driving, psychotically violent local criminal. Falling in with Kalpa, Ayoub tries to enlarge his status (and wallet) enough to win Laura over, but soon finds that his new life is far more than he bargained for.</StoryLine>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>A slender, morally simplified fable that makes up for its tonal and narrative imprecisions with considerable visual energy, musical pizzazz, and a panoply of colorful characters ...</Review>
            <Review>While "Prince" feels a little slight when the credits roll less than 80 minutes after it begins, it's still a strong, creative addition to the crowded coming-of-age genre.</Review>
            <Review>Although the disaffected youth drama knows no international boundaries, few have felt as fresh and consistently unpredictable as the slyly satirical "Prince" by Dutch filmmaker Sam de Jong.</Review>
            <Review>Instead of shades of ambiguity or a structure that quivers upon impact, Sam de Jong, the writer and director of "Prince," depicts a universe in absolute terms. Ayoub's arc from good boy to bad prince is too rapid and uncomplicated.</Review>
            <Review>De Jong indulges in some shocking, violent imagery in these passages, and this detracts from the film's effective social portrait; so too does the aggressively loud synth-pop soundtrack.</Review>
            <Review>Expertly paced and gorgeous to behold, Sam de Jong's Dutch-language directorial debut sets a stylish coming-of-age story in a bleak Amsterdam housing project.</Review>
            <Review>An interesting mix of humor, drama and romance. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>A light film, fun and sweet about appearances and teenage love. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>A Eurotrash hood movie, ineffectively placing a post-80s costume design and pastel color palette inside script elements as old as Mean Streets or something like Juice.</Review>
            <Review>Elasri's engaging performance and de Jong's vibrant directorial style connect well to create an energetic and genuinely unusual little film.</Review>
            <Review>Like so many coming-of-age debuts before it, Prince isn't world-changing, but like the best of them, there's enough youthful electricity to De Jong's work to make you want to see what he does next.</Review>
            <Review>It wants to be cute, it wants to cool, and it also wants to be thoughtful and engaging, but Sam de Jong is unable to make the story feel tight and focused enough to allow it to succeed on all those levels.</Review>

            <Review>The plot in the South Korean martial-arts period-piece Memories of the Sword may verge on the incomprehensible but, boy, is it gorgeous.</Review>
            <Review>Memories of the Sword stands apart from other action films because Park wisely imagines violence as an elemental clash of dispositions.</Review>
            <Review>An engaging tale that doesn't reach the level of epic but should appeal to fans of wuxia action and majestic visuals all the same.</Review>
            <Review>Lavish Korean historical epic has many things going for it, but a bewildering plot and an undeniable repetitiveness undermine its intent.</Review>
            <Review>These actors keep Memories of the Sword watchable and give us faith that we'll see them in better projects.</Review>
            <Review>Park Heung-sik's Memories of the Sword is a historical Korean action film that delivers plenty of what its title promises.</Review>

            <Review>Less a chase picture than a driving-around picture, the movie relies heavily on long action sequences that never develop much zip.</Review>
            <Review>Pitched somewhere between Duel and Joyride, this motor-psycho picture fails to stake out new territory or ring any significant changes on a decades-old formula.</Review>
            <Review>Time and again, the filmmaker cuts the money shot meant to theoretically cap a sequence.</Review>
            <Review>It's fast, slick and lovely to look at, but there's absolutely nothing there beneath the hood.</Review>
            <Review>It has no cinematic merit whatsoever, no redeeming quirk that can retrieve it from the tedious pile of auto-porn flicks.</Review>
            <Review>The film's only plus points are a few jump scares, slickness and the scenic great outdoors, where it was shot. Apart from that, there's little else to recommend.</Review>
            <Review>Wrecker occasionally uses some interesting shots but on the whole this is an inferior film and a weak example of the horror/slasher genre.</Review>

            <Review>The Visit is a pleasant surprise.</Review>
            <Review>For all its intelligence and craft, M. Night Shyamalan's foray into the genre of found-footage horror has the feeling of homework done well.</Review>
            <Review>It is with some surprise-and perhaps even a hint of disappointment-that I must report that The Visit is merely mediocre and not the breathtaking calamity that we've come to anticipate from its author.</Review>
            <Review>M. Night Shyamalan's latest film may well have been his last chance at redemption. Fortunately, he rises to the challenge and makes The Visit good, scary fun.</Review>
            <Review>It was fun watching this with a gasping and screaming audience. For horror-goers, the comparative competence must hit the spot. But there's nothing new here -- and what I sensed for 94 minutes was compromise.</Review>
            <Review>An unoriginal faux-doc horror picture that actually works like a demonic charm.</Review>
            <Review>Here, [Shyamalan] loosened up, shed some of his ego, and reminded all of us what a gifted writer and director he truly is.</Review>
            <Review>[A] collection of jump scares [that lasts] until everyone arrives at [Shyamalan's] trademarked final twist (also called, in more recent times, the closing cringe).</Review>
            <Review>M. Night Shyamalan made another good movie, and I'm as surprised as you are.</Review>
            <Review>It's a strange thing to watch a filmmaker try like hell to convince us that he's in on the joke that's become his career.</Review>
            <Review>There is definitely a lot to appreciate in this creepy little number, however, if you're not a fan of this particular sub-genre, then you're probably better off looking for your frights elsewhere.</Review>
            <Review>There are a lot of both the good and the bad "Shyamalanisms" in this film to both support the argument that this is a good comeback and to show that he isn't the filmmaker he was 15 years ago.</Review>

            <Review>Writer-director Leslye Headland has made a film that is saucy and sweet, for the boys and for the girls -- an R-rated Seinfeld, not that there's anything wrong with that.</Review>
            <Review>Screenwriter-director Leslye Headland has an ear for dialogue and offbeat characters, but the film never feels fresh or engaging.</Review>
            <Review>It's obvious where "Sleeping with Other People" is going; the fun is in getting there.</Review>
            <Review>Sudeikis' smooth charisma and Brie's wide-eyed charm almost carry the film, but while Headland bravely chooses to skip certain expected rom-com beats, she also fails to earn certain rom-com payoffs.</Review>
            <Review>Headland refuses to redeem her characters, which is what makes "Sleeping With Other People" ultimately more interesting than other rom-coms.</Review>
            <Review>"Sleeping With Other People" is one of the best and funniest recent attempts to update the rom-com - but the container feels too antiquated for the world it captures, which is so furiously alive.</Review>
            <Review>Somewhere along the line, somebody sanded down Headland's rough edges.</Review>
            <Review>The romantic comedy has re-emerged alive and well.</Review>
            <Review>A pretty simple and easy going romantic comedy that keeps you hooked by the realness of it's story. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>...funny, sexy and wonderfully free of reflexive irony. It's exactly what a romantic comedy ought to be.</Review>
            <Review>Director Leslye Headland's follow-up to Bachelorette addresses big issues like the role of sex in relationships while delivering refreshing laughs thanks to a supporting cast who make their value known; Adam Brody's cameo is a revelation.</Review>
            <Review>Perhaps Headland is afraid of her films being too unlikable for audiences, or this an attempt to legitimise herself within the mainstream. Because, ultimately, why sacrifice all this smart, perceptive modernity for a finale hewn of Hollywood cliché?</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>The Walk turns what is a relatively straightforward act - albeit a scarily placed one - into something stunning by restoring a sense of physicality to what's happening onscreen.</Review>
            <Review>Zemeckis's failing is his inattention to every other detail, but The Walk undeniably exists for its climax: one stunt it does manage to pull off flawlessly.</Review>
            <Review>It's two-thirds of a great film but the slow start and unremarkable first hour hold it back. Still, for those who buy into the precept that "good things are worth waiting for," The Walk unquestionably delivers.</Review>
            <Review>The walk itself is the film's central, and only, real achievement, but it's a doozy.</Review>
            <Review>For at least the duration of the 25-minute wire sequence, The Walk is a breathless, exhilarating moviegoing experience. It's just not much of a movie.</Review>
            <Review>Even in its greatest moment, The Walk breaks the spell with an unnecessary narration about how Petit felt in that moment, how the sky looked to him, how a bird came soaring towards his head.</Review>
            <Review>The Walk's walk quickly becomes tasteless, making a mockery of a spectacular feat.</Review>
            <Review>Just the mechanics of getting to the roof are fun -- filled with surprise allies and strokes of luck and last minute escapes.</Review>
            <Review>Gordon-Levitt captures the nuances of Petit's personality and, more importantly, taps into Petit's urgent need to go for a stroll some 400 meters above the ground.</Review>
            <Review>Between the easy philosophising and celebratory tone, the film has the visual thrill that proves why some movies still need to be seen on the big screen.</Review>
            <Review>It's applause-worthy work, and a killer climax. But a killer climax does not a motion picture make.</Review>
            <Review>The film is more gimmickry than poetry. The effects are state-of-the-art, but the effect is remarkably earthbound.</Review>

            <Review>The movie is carried by the two hard-dancing leads, whose sweat-soaked strutting demands attention.</Review>
            <Review>Rich in period detail, it's as transportative to the shuffling spins, fashion subculture and euphoric, amphetamine-fuelled all-nighters of 1974 Lancashire and the cult-following DJs of the Wigan Casino as a documentary, turned up to 11.</Review>
            <Review>The film has a ferocious, shaggy energy that mirrors that of the testosterone-, amphetamine- and adrenaline-pumped boys.</Review>
            <Review>Where this movie comes up short is in bringing any kind of real life to its bildungsroman side.</Review>
            <Review>The first feature from writer-director Elaine Constantine, herself a Northern soul veteran, the film follows a fairly familiar innocent-led-astray storyline.</Review>
            <Review>Funny and feisty, gritty and sometimes grim, this first feature from the photographer Elaine Constantine delivers a sweaty snapshot of a very specific time and place.</Review>
            <Review>Disaffected youth and music go together like - well, there's actually no better simile. So how else to describe British director Elaine Constantine's first film? For one thing, it's got a well-defined sense of place and time.</Review>
            <Review>The cast is mostly made of newcomers, and they are very good indeed.</Review>
            <Review>Every last detail feels authentic, from the slightly unfashionable clothes to the cramped rooms in which John and his friends sort through records and piles of pills.</Review>
            <Review>It's best to not quibble with the details and just enjoy the sights and sounds of this period drama.</Review>
            <Review>"Northern Soul" feels driven by youthful energy.</Review>
            <Review>Brilliantly captures the amphetamine-fuelled energy and sweat-soaked fervour of 1970s northern England's soul music scene.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Directed by Takashi Miike, OVER YOUR DEAD BODY is a modern take on one of Japan's most famous ghost stories. Taking its cue from the art of Kabuki, the terrifying tale unfolds within the walls of a theatre where a troupe of players are in rehearsals for a production of Yotsuya Kaidan, a 200-year-old tale of murder, betrayal, and phantasmagorical vengeance - and where life comes to imitate art in ultimately shocking ways.</StoryLine>

            <Review>The movie is dull right up until the point that it becomes completely, characteristically bonkers, with Miike trotting out some of his trademark obscene violence.</Review>
            <Review>A stately backstage drama that gradually morphs into a full-blown supernatural horror movie, [this is] a synthetic experience that sporadically intrigues but never fully engages.</Review>
            <Review>Over Your Dead Body will certainly appeal to Miike's hardcore fan base, for his technical mastery of blood is on display throughout.</Review>
            <Review>Instead of relying on frenetic insanity and buckets of viscera, this movie sets an uneasy tone where tension slowly crawls to its peak.</Review>
            <Review>Evocatively shot and earns a few winces of discomfort on its way to a lurid finale twist. What the picture fails to accomplish, however, is giving the viewer someone to care about, relate to, or understand.</Review>
            <Review>two parallel narratives bleed into one another in a deeply irrational manner, blurring the boundaries between theatre and film, antique and (post)modern, actor and character, the living and the dead.</Review>
            <Review>Over Your Dead Body is a convoluted spectacle that sees Miike's visual prowess wasted on a puzzling story about life imitating art.</Review>

            <Review>Any sense that the kids die because they never bothered to research the tribe they were trying to save is undermined by the movie's treatment of the natives as just as abstract.</Review>
            <Review>"The Green Inferno" is a breezy college comedy. Until it's not. Then it's really, really not.</Review>
            <Review>A project that boasts all the appeal (and aroma) of a carcass rotting in the rainforest.</Review>
            <Review>"The Green Inferno" is not exactly a feel-good film, but it gets a very particular job done.</Review>
            <Review>A flop of a horror film that overestimates gore for actual scares.</Review>
            <Review>The Green Inferno is less a riff on spaghetti splatter flicks like Cannibal Holocaust than a desperate-to-shock pastiche of guts and gore served with a wink to audiences with strong stomachs. You know who you are.</Review>
            <Review>It's unfortunate that the entire thing is kind of tedious, while its frequent gore is disappointingly unimaginative.</Review>
            <Review>It's mostly just sad - not because Roth takes such a sharp scalpel to the social justice movement, but because he swings a baseball bat, and misses by a mile.</Review>
            <Review>It's not provoking, not exciting, and not even fun. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>This weak splatter movie ... isn't half scary enough. Even fans of cinematic gore will be disappointed by the hammy attempts at blood and guts.</Review>

The subsequent health and environmental damage will take generations, and in some cases thousands of years to heal. Our ground water, wells, drinking water, air and soil are contaminated with some of the most toxic heavy metals known to man - and yet we still have no firm plan in place for the storage of tons of nuclear materials we produce every year.</StoryLine>

            <Review>The heist in Heist is pretty pedestrian, and the film turns into Die Hard-on-a-bus with a couple of so-so twists and serviceable spasms of action. If that's what you're looking for, rent Speed instead.</Review>
            <Review>Everything is dully routine, with characters much too composed in volatile situations to be believed.</Review>
            <Review>As throwbacks go, it's more bearable than shoulder pads.</Review>
            <Review>As vapidly generic as its title, British director Scott Mann's "Heist" is a by-the-numbers crime thriller that squanders a decent cast, including Robert De Niro, Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Dave Bautista.</Review>
            <Review>Whatever its flaws, "Heist" is to be commended for repeatedly finding ways to distract us from them.</Review>
            <Review>Caught between genre potboiler and would-be human drama, "Heist" doesn't have a mark to hit. But it leaves some good impressions.</Review>
            <Review>It's yet another disappointing turn from the Oscar-winning actor, Robert De Niro - it's becoming difficult to believe that this is the same actor who played Jake La Motta in Raging Bull or Vito Corleone in The Godfather.</Review>
            <Review>... more tedious than exciting as it leads to a preposterous climax.</Review>
            <Review>Despite a high-concept idea and a good cast, this crime thriller feels somewhat half-baked and rushed. It might once have been promising, but it seems like something went wrong along the way.</Review>

            <Review>The Perfect Guy - a poor cross between Basic Instinct and Fatal Attraction - is the latest obsessive-relationship thriller that promises an exciting ride, but just doesn't have the tools to deliver the goods.</Review>
            <Review>Glossy but blandly directed stalker thriller The Perfect Guy fails to do anything interesting with its stock set-up and there's no erotic frisson between the characters. Sadly, a misted shower door is as steamy as things get here.</Review>

            <Review>The Perfect Guy might be high melodrama . . . yet despite its faults, it dresses nicely, wears good cologne, and has excellent table manners.</Review>
            <Review>The B-movie riffs are efficiently executed, but the biggest mystery is why this supporting feature should be troubling our cinema screens when its target audience is firmly nestled on the sofa.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Hitman: Agent 47 fails to clear the low bar set by its predecessor, forsaking thrilling action in favor of a sleekly hollow m�lange of dull violence and product placement.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Agent 47 doesn't feel like a character who's got what it takes to be a franchise hero - he, and the film, are lacking in personality.</Review>
            <Review>Only a bare minimum of non-action scenes were included in the final cut. There's enough here to piece together a rudimentary storyline but the details are often either confusing or nonsensical.</Review>
            <Review>The friction between stateliness and lunacy is more intriguing than, say, the line-toeing mediocrity of a second-rate Marvel movie.</Review>
            <Review>As such films go, it's efficiently done juvenilia.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately "Hitman: Agent 47," like the profession it worships, feels purely contractual.</Review>
            <Review>About as violent and soulless as its title suggests.</Review>
            <Review>So here we have another video game adaptation that critics will largely dismiss and audiences will mostly ignore.</Review>
            <Review>Overall though, this is a film to be taken with a pinch of salt. There's a certain sense of enjoyment to be found in the hyper-action of Hitman: Agent 47, but absolutely nothing to chew on or take away.</Review>
            <Review>Rupert Friend plays an assassin even deadlier than Homeland's Peter Quinn... But his very indestructibility means the story's formulaic action never gets particularly gripping.</Review>
            <Review>The plot is generic in the extreme and the dialogue and acting barely disguises the fact that it's really just a series of not very exciting set-pieces strung together.</Review>
            <Review>Unfortunately, while Hitman: Agent 47 may offer a passable diversion for the action fans among us, for everyone else it's best avoided.</Review>
            <Review>Hitman: Agent 47 does deliver sleek production values and a stand-out performance from Hannah Ware... Other than that, it's a nonsensical story that feels as if it was written by a 10-year-old who plays too many video games.</Review>

            <Review>In the moments where she finally becomes angry, Heigl's pugnacious qualities serve her well; her rage is pure, cleansing and righteous in defense of her life.</Review>
            <Review>One of the many irritants in this trite, well-intentioned lecture on tolerance: The audience is always several moves ahead of the script.</Review>
            <Review>This is a movie displaced in time. And it's barely a movie. It's more like a dusty, faded old pamphlet: "So your daughter's decided to get gay-married..."</Review>
            <Review>It all feels outdated, simplistic and insulting to both the characters and the audience.</Review>
            <Review>Harps on the retrograde ideas that women should all aspire to be married, and happiness is a permanent state of being that the virtuous can achieve.</Review>
            <Review>"Jenny's Wedding" isn't ill-intentioned or actively bad; it's just a little too familiar, a little too safe and a little too satisfied with itself.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director Mary Agnes Donoghue's heart is clearly in the right place... but Jenny's relationship with Kitty is so thinly sketched that it's the stumbling emotional journeys taken by the other members of her family that prove more engaging.</Review>
            <Review>Donoghue has made a warm, enjoyable picture, thankfully refusing to dress her work up in politics and condemnation, prioritizing the human factor.</Review>
            <Review>...a tonally deaf film to the times, a film about a group of largely insufferable characters who we're forced to deal with for 90 minutes.</Review>
            <Review>If there's any conceivable downside to the legalization of gay marriage, it's movies like Jenny's Wedding.</Review>
            <Review>As a movie it is a complete misfire. The story, performances and editing choices range from predictable to risible.</Review>
            <Review>Tolerance in the film doesn't so much suggest a recognizably real epiphany as it does a moving Hallmark card.</Review>

            <Review>Equal parts charming, strange, goofy, unpredictable and genuinely horrifying.</Review>
            <Review>Bone Tomahawk is terrifying and strange, to be sure, but it's the old-fashioned veneer that makes it beautiful.</Review>
            <Review>While the genre jump from John Ford to Eli Roth may be off-putting to some, it raises the stakes on a climax in a way that most Westerns fail to do.</Review>
            <Review>Though its cult-movie desires often show, "Bone Tomahawk" is ultimately sold by its cast, who commit fully to Zahler's discursive indulgences.</Review>
            <Review>A witty fusion of western, horror and comedy that gallops to its own beat.</Review>
            <Review>On the list of things the world needs, a mash-up of The Searchers and Hannibal is pretty far down there. But if there is going to be such a thing, the smartly cast and well-crafted Bone Tomahawk fills the bill nicely.</Review>
            <Review>It's the definition of "not for everybody", but it's essential for the patient and adventurous horror aficionado.</Review>
            <Review>His cast is outstanding, starting with Kurt Russell as Sheriff Hunt.</Review>
            <Review>... a sturdy frontier western about strong but decidedly mortal settlers who take the responsibilities of community seriously, and its odyssey takes them to the border of horror cinema without leaving its frontier drama landscape or sensibility.</Review>
            <Review>Bone Tomahawk makes its characters shine through a smart script, staying away from the traditional and often used formula. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>A perfect blend of horror and western elements. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Although not wholly successful, Bone Tomahawk is nevertheless the latest example of the quiet renaissance that Westerns have enjoyed over the past few years.</Review>

            <Review>Like all of Zwick's works, it's perfectly watchable fare, but it's often infuriating for its refusal to dig deeper into its incredibly compelling subject.</Review>
            <Review>Fine-looking but safe ...</Review>
            <Review>Archived news reports and a Dick Cavett interview fit seamlessly into the dramatic recreations, as do era-specific rock tunes.</Review>
            <Review>Despite his best emoting, Maguire ultimately comes across as Peter Parker with a mole and a bad haircut.</Review>
            <Review>Genius is fascinating, particularly when it is complicated, as it always seems to be.</Review>
            <Review>Features a showboat performance from Tobey Maguire as the increasingly disturbed Fischer, along with a more composed one from Liev Schreiber as the taciturn Spassky.</Review>
            <Review>There's no better metaphor for the film's plot than this sport. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>A film that works because of the great performances by the two leads. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Histrionic Tobey Maguire is my least-favorite iteration of the actor, but he is certainly believable as the prodigal loon.</Review>
            <Review>[Zwick] makes the historic matches come to life, such that even non-players will appreciate the gripping excitement and intellectual rigour to be found in the battle of wits that is chess.</Review>
            <Review>'Pawn Sacrifice' takes all of those tropes and cranks them up to 11, far past the barometers of either believable human behavior or credible filmmaking.</Review>
            <Review>Its desire to tell a small part of a historical firebrand's story is undermined by its reluctance - or inability - to get inside his mind.</Review>

            <Review>If Pan's screenplay is a lesson in anything, it's that most beloved stories don't require a whole cinematic universe to go along with them.</Review>
            <Review>The most cheering surprise of the season is "Pan."</Review>
            <Review>The film fulfills its limited mandate of providing fast-paced adventure and some nice eye candy without adding anything memorable to the tale of The Boy Who Can Fly.</Review>
            <Review>The very idea behind Pan is ill-conceived. Who wants a prequel to Peter Pan?</Review>
            <Review>Tasked to come up with any sort of backstory to get us to the flying and the crowing and the Lost Boys and the never growing up, Pan goes with what has become default fantasy template No. 1.</Review>
            <Review>This joyless, juiceless Pan is a theme-park ride from hell.</Review>
            <Review>Creating a gritty backstory for a 12-year-old can't have been easy, but director Joe Wright pulls it off with great aplomb, making it one of the most entertaining visits to Neverland so far.</Review>
            <Review>Blackbeard shouts, 'You shall be rewarded with confectionary!' Kids love confectionary more than life. That doesn't mean it's good for them. 'Pan' is cinematic confectionary.</Review>
            <Review>Jackman's Blackbeard is a high point.</Review>
            <Review>Collectively, it's all too much, and this sweet story about a boy looking for his mother and finding his place in the world is overpowered by how things look, rather than what we should feel.</Review>
            <Review>Painting Neverland in such drab colours, with a story that revolves around child labour, is hardly a blueprint for a fun-packed movie.</Review>
            <Review>Jackman throws himself into the role, while little Levi Miller, although serviceable, doesn't quite get the room to show signs of being the boy who eventually comes to be Peter Pan - a factor that only serves to pull down the film further.</Review>

            <Review>(The end) slams the brakes on any goodwill you had for the characters.</Review>
            <Review>Silva's screenplay has a slice-of-life feel; Sergio Armstrong's cinematography provides the natural lighting and handheld camerawork that adds to that sensation.</Review>
            <Review>Nasty Baby takes aim at a fat target: gay modern-family dramedies, those well-meaning, self-congratulatory films that haven't actually felt modern in a decade.</Review>
            <Review>Nasty indeed.</Review>
            <Review>This is one of those awkward films that depicts complacent characters while itself looking complacent, and Silva never quite seems in control of his volatile material.</Review>
            <Review>Silva captures the boho hipster milieu of the Brooklyn setting, but adds a sense of unease ...</Review>
            <Review>Nasty Baby is an off-kilter film that alternates between passages of amusement and aggravation, before it suddenly snaps into focus in its final stages</Review>
            <Review>Nasty Baby is a one-trick dramedy that bets the house on a daring final-reel twist that arrives far too late to compensate for the sheer bum-numbing agony that's gone before it.</Review>
            <Review>This is a strange, unclassifiable piece of work, bordering on craziness and incoherence but acted and directed with such quiet vehemence that it has some interest.</Review>

            <Review>Perry's movie may not be easy to watch, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director Alex Ross Perry conjures such a strong atmosphere around his characters -- and Elisabeth Moss and Katherine Waterston are so powerful in the leads --that one gets sucked into their emotional conflict.</Review>
            <Review>Almost subliminally upsetting, "Queen of Earth" touches viewers' primal fears by continually messing with worries embedded in our subconscious.</Review>
            <Review>Perry may never make a movie for the masses, whoever they are. But his truest work burrows into weird, blackly comic places few other filmmakers would dare explore.</Review>
            <Review>It makes for a slightly muddled palette, but one that, like one of those lenticular pictures that changes depending on the angle it's viewed from, can seem either darkly cynical or harrowing.</Review>
            <Review>A darkly funny and increasingly disturbing portrait of a young woman's descent into madness after the traumatic loss of her artist father.</Review>
            <Review>It displays some of the navel-gazing impulses of the mumblecore movement; it's no surprise to see that mumble-originator Joe Swanberg serves as a producer.</Review>
            <Review>At times, the style is very mannered but Moss and Waterston give rich and subtle performances as the two feuding friends who provide a twisted reflection of one another.</Review>

            <Review>For those who ever wondered what it would be like to see John Cusack and Jackie Chan engage in a swordfight (both of you), here is "Dragon Blade."</Review>
            <Review>Just about everyone seems to get slashed, carved up or skewered, and vengeance rains down upon all. Except, of course, the one villain who truly deserved it. The filmmaker.</Review>
            <Review>In Dragon Blade, East meets West in a murky, mediocre muddle.</Review>
            <Review>It's kind of a mess. That more than 20 minutes have been trimmed for the stateside release may have hurt the film's coherence, but viewers will be thankful for the shorter sit.</Review>
            <Review>Dragon Blade" is a solidly constructed epic that, despite its many battle scenes, has a strong message of pacifism and unity.</Review>
            <Review>People are burned alive, crushed like insects, hurled from rooftops. They may not deserve all this. But neither do we.</Review>
            <Review>Dragon Blade offers a daftly entertaining throwback to historical epics of the 1960s.</Review>
            <Review>Handsome production design and sweeping battle vistas lend a touch of class, with Chan directing the action scenes with trademark brio.</Review>
            <Review>Chan brings martial artistry to the fight, Cusack his siege skills, and the the film overall is a mishmash of languages, styles and tones.</Review>
            <Review>There are nice moments, but this is pure bombast, and Chan's natural action flair is not given free rein.</Review>
            <Review>This generic offering simply doesn't transcend the tropes of the genre at hand.</Review>
            <Review>Cusack does a good impression of an estate agent having a midlife crisis, while Brody adds to his gallery of eye-rollingly awful performances by going full Tony Montana.</Review>

            <Review>Black Mass... can't figure Whitey out. Developments that seem important come and go without their mark on the man being clear.</Review>
            <Review>How much longer must we subscribe, as moviegoers, to the sentimental brotherhood of violence?</Review>
            <Review>The role is Depp's best in many years, and a welcome respite from the parade of prancing pseudo-villains-Mortdecai, the Wolf, Barnabas Collins, Jack Sparrow, Willy Wonka-to which he has devoted far too much of his career.</Review>
            <Review>Depp's performance as Bulger is as strong, and as energized, as anything he's done on screen for years.</Review>
            <Review>It's as if the spirit of a psychopath like Bulger resists the camera. Or maybe the movie isn't imaginative enough to penetrate his shell.</Review>
            <Review>[Depp] holds the screen as pure malevolence.</Review>
            <Review>A gripping character study and the best-acted film of the year so far, an unnerving look at the pursuit of power.</Review>
            <Review>You've seen better mob movies, and much better Depps.</Review>
            <Review>Yes, it's a relief to see Depp playing a real character again, not another one of his circus freaks -- I just wish he'd been given a better film to operate in.</Review>
            <Review>The cast is so deep, and there's so much more to the story, that it's hard not to get the feeling that this would have made a great TV series.</Review>
            <Review>[Black Mass] is powered by Depp's depiction of the man as a coiled spring, as likely to give an associate a hug as three lead slugs in the face.</Review>
            <Review>A a well-crafted, well-acted, and competently executed movie that you've seen many, many times before.</Review>

            <Review>With Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation, we're getting the best Bond movie since Casino Royale in 2006.</Review>
            <Review>The franchise has gradually refined its combination of jaw-dropping action set pieces and sleekly cool world of espionage into something that's approaching pop perfection.</Review>
            <Review>Of the many heists and grabs that litter the movie, none is as blatant as the deft, irrepressible manner in which Ferguson, displaying a light smile and a brisk way with a knife, steals the show.</Review>
            <Review>You don't overcome the "impossible" by thinking it over a little more carefully. You overcome it through the application of sheer, unvarnished willpower, a quality that Cruise has always possessed in abundance.</Review>
            <Review>Everything, even Alec Baldwin's tight and itchy turn as a CIA buzzkill, is mere window-dressing to Cruise's attempts to kill himself on-screen.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director Christopher McQuarrie, whose action movie skills are at best high-adequate, compensates by being good at interpersonal stuff. He can make us feel for the characters as something more than action toys.</Review>
            <Review>There's a kind of soldierly camaraderie among the agents, who constantly find themselves betrayed by politicians, military officers, and even their own commanders, and they band together to save the each other along with saving the world as we know it.</Review>
            <Review>Christopher McQuarrie's latest proves he's one of the best filmmakers working today.</Review>
            <Review>Tom Cruise is 53. I repeat: Tom Cruise is 53.</Review>
            <Review>If Jason Bourne is our most brooding spy and James Bond is our suavest, then IMF agent Ethan Hunt is our most intense, the one most willing to do whatever it takes to get the job done. Sound like anyone we know?</Review>
            <Review>As mentioned, Cruise has always been an underrated actor due to pretty-boy looks, but his ever-so-slightly supernormal energy and intensity make him perfect for what has now become his signature movie role.</Review>
            <Review>First-rate popcorn, a meticulously devised and elegantly executed spy movie that manages to thrill with its stunts, jangle with its set pieces, land a laugh or two, and not insult our intelligence</Review>

        <Title>Count Dracula</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 1970</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>100</Duration>
        <StoryLine>This doggedly faithful adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel about a vampiric nobleman was helmed by cult director Jesus Franco. Despite its textual loyalty and atmospheric photography by Manuel Merino, the film -- a co-production from Spain, Italy, Germany, and Liechtenstein -- is plodding and dull. Even Christopher Lee (in an uncharacteristically weak performance as Dracula), Klaus Kinski (as the mad Renfield), and seven credited screenwriters cannot make this confused, distant film worthwhile. Cult filmmaker Bruno Mattei edited the Italian version, and scenes were later used in Calvin Floyd's In Search of Dracula. Among several different versions are prints running 100, 98, and 86 minutes. Franco appears as a servant to Professor Van Helsing (Herbert Lom), and though certainly literate, the film nevertheless fails as both horror and drama.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Writer-director Kenny Riches lays on the whimsy pretty thick, and his sub-Jarmusch deadpan style (inert camera, intentionally flat line readings) adds another layer of affect to the story.</Review>
            <Review>Although Beef and Conan are far from stereotypical, the quirkiness and eccentricities ascribed to them by writer-director Kenny Riches harp on their otherness all the same.</Review>
            <Review>The kind of indie doodle of a movie in which several potentially interesting ideas co-exist but never quite come together and where supporters will call the narrative "freewheeling" while naysayers will insist on "rambling."</Review>
            <Review>Another stab at that school of comedy in which adult losers acting like particularly dweeby 13-year-olds in nonsensical situations is assumed to be automatically hilarious.</Review>
            <Review>It's definitely an acquired taste, but it's most helpful to view the film as a fairy tale.</Review>
            <Review>Like the waves of the ocean its characters occasionally and semi-fearfully embrace, The Strongest Man continually goes in and out, connecting and drifting away.</Review>
            <Review>It's uneven, goofy and personal, in all the ways that independent comedy can be both delightful and occasionally befuddling.</Review>
            <Review>Doesn't piece together as an experience, just random points of tonal triumph in picture that seems perfectly comfortable adding up to very little.</Review>
            <Review>Weird and honest about the malaise that can settle into driftless adulthood, "The Strongest Man" suggests that the only way to way forward is to accept where we are first.</Review>

            <Review>It's a shame that Guggenheim's slickly produced documentary examines such an important and fascinating story with such underwhelming results.</Review>
            <Review>The result is a film more educational than engrossing; high schoolers should see it - the rest of us, maybe not.</Review>
            <Review>While Malala's saintly status is front and center, there are lingering, disquieting and incomplete issues all over the place.</Review>
            <Review>The chief draw here, of course, is Malala herself: an irrepressible, earnest voice for the oppressed.</Review>
            <Review>Truly a remarkable person.</Review>
            <Review>The film is worthy, obviously, and it forces us to think about the prices paid by our unexpected heroes.</Review>
            <Review>A beautiful, thought-provoking piece of film-making which demands to be seen.</Review>
            <Review>A few too many shots of his subject receiving awards and meeting famous people, however Malala Yousafzai is an extraordinary woman and, no matter how her story is presented, it's most definitely worth hearing.</Review>
            <Review>Despite's its perceived shortcoming, He Named Me Malala is still a powerful documentary that offers us a glimpse - but not a look - into the life of one extraordinary young lady.</Review>
            <Review>Davis Guggenheim's solid and moving documentary He Named Me Malala gives us the background of a story that shocked the world, but could have been more rigorously made.</Review>
            <Review>It has the feel of a handsome classroom study aid, but nonetheless one every child (from nine to 90) could learn from.</Review>
            <Review>A gentle and very respectful documentary about Malala Yousafzai... Through her story, director Davis Guggenheim highlights issues of free speech, universal education and how an inspirational teenager can change her world.</Review>

            <Review>[A] fascinating documentary ...</Review>
            <Review>As dramatically satisfying as the most crowd-pleasing scripted sports saga.</Review>
            <Review>Despite its oversights, the film - shot and scored beautifully - is an enthusiastic introduction to this delirious event and its peposo of passion, style and intrigue.</Review>
            <Review>While Spender spends enough time with both new and retired jockey legends to collect a gold mine of macho, bullheaded rapport, you wish she delved deeper into the more sinister, behind-the-scenes wheelings and dealings.</Review>
            <Review>If the film is understandably intoxicated by the multi-coloured spectacle on offer, it's under no illusions as to the insidious corruption and insane brutality unleashed on the path to the prize.</Review>
            <Review>Palio is an exciting documentary, though I'd have liked it more if it had paid some attention to those who have levelled charges of animal cruelty against the race. If it stops short of being a tourist promotion, it's only by a nose.</Review>

            <Review>Rather oddly titled for what's basically a sentimental family pic, "Sex, Death and Bowling" mixes numerous formulaic, overfamiliar elements that never quite gel.</Review>
            <Review>It's overly busy and seems to mask that there's something lacking. Grenier anchors with a nuanced lead performance, but for such a starry cast, the cinematic quality doesn't match up to the talent on screen.</Review>
            <Review>Attempting a complex tone combining melodrama and quirk, it's moderately successful on a few fronts.</Review>

            <Review>Being awful is still no substitute for being funny - but Seth MacFarlane's talking teddy bear sequel does manage some laughs anyway.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is so indifferently plotted that it soon becomes a bore.</Review>
            <Review>If you're ready to go with the hit-and-miss flow, you'll laugh your ass off.</Review>
            <Review>If you liked the original Ted, Seth MacFarlane's 2012 surprise smash about a pot-smoking, potty-mouthed teddy bear, then you will probably like Ted 2. It is essentially the exact same movie, and more - and less.</Review>
            <Review>In a way, it's pitiable more than anything.</Review>
            <Review>For a movie that pretends to address issues of what it means to be human, "Ted 2" is soulless at its core, a pure product.</Review>
            <Review>The "offensive" jokes that pop up every once in a while in 'Ted 2' aren't social satire, or good gags, or even particularly vicious - they're a gimmick, taunting, trollery.</Review>
            <Review>Ted 2 is a case of been there, done that, mixed with some of the funniest gags you'll see this year.</Review>
            <Review>"Ted 2" sees all of [Seth MacFarlane's] worst proclivities front and center, as shaggy and undisciplined as ever.</Review>
            <Review>Ludicrous, crass but also undeniably fun,Ted 2 - the sequel to Seth MacFarlane's successful 2012 comedy, Ted -proves to be a more consistent and better drawn-out affair than its predecessor.</Review>
            <Review>The whole devolves into an over-long Family Guy episode chock full of random asides, weird cameos, and goofy homage.</Review>

            <Review>A lightweight and basically unnecessary attempt to once again bring some cinematic life to one of the lesser teams in the Marvel Universe.</Review>
            <Review>The latest iteration of "Fantastic Four" is far from what its name suggests. Profoundly uninteresting, it hits all the beats of the standard superhero movie, but provides nothing in the way of imagination or magic.</Review>
            <Review>Laughably cheesy, bordering on Zardoz levels of simplicity.</Review>
            <Review>If you would like to admire the awfulness of Fantastic Four without actually having to sit through it--or if you've already seen the movie and are still reeling from the experience--read on.</Review>
            <Review>The special effects are cheesy, the acting perfunctory, the plotting pallid.</Review>
            <Review>It's not wholesale terrible -- just depressingly mediocre, and at a certain point you sort of start wishing it WERE definitively terrible, because that would at least make it more entertaining or give it a certain strange raison d'etre.</Review>
            <Review>A poorly constructed, ineptly executed, flatfooted piece of Branded Product that plays as though it were written by a piece of software fed every superhero movie script to date and instructed to synthesize them.</Review>
            <Review>As flawed as it was when it was first released in the 2005, the original film still stuck to the tried-and-true formula of quickly getting the origin story out of the way to get to the good stuff: the characters and the action.</Review>
            <Review>It's a case of good start, flat middle and a curiously bad nothing-at-stake finish.</Review>
            <Review>It's hard to shake the feeling of a better movie being trapped inside a bad movie's body.</Review>
            <Review>Throw in some of the worst plotting and pacing to ever taint the silver screen and a strangely gloomy and sombre tone and you have, well, not very much.</Review>
            <Review>Putting Fantastic Four's box office and production woes aside leaves nothing more than a malformed curio.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Unleashed! A Dog Dancing Story follows the journey of an amateur dog dancing troupe and an aspiring theatre director as they attempt to mount the first ever dog dancing and indoor kite flying theatrical performance. The film captures the challenges the women face in their personal lives as well as on the stage, and is as much about the trials and tribulations of producing an amateur theatrical performance as it is about the amazing bond between handler and dog. The group spends over two years realizing their first time director's vision as they write scripts, build sets, raise funds and rehearse to the point of exhaustion. As tension mounts and hurdles pile on, the resolve of these spirited women and their dogs is constantly tested while the director's patience is pushed to the brink. Unleashed! A Dog Dancing Story is a captivating look into the lives of those who dance with their dogs, not for fame, but simply for the love of it.(c)</StoryLine>

            <Review>Director Oren Moverman doesn't seem all that interested in the grimy horror of homelessness except insofar as it gives him an opportunity to show Gere in the midst of an identity crisis: who am I, and how do I fit into the world?</Review>
            <Review>"Time Out of Mind" is consciously disoriented and slow, to its own ultimate detriment.</Review>
            <Review>Richard Gere stars as an elderly man forced out on the streets of New York City. There isn't much more to the story than that, but for the talented writer-director Oren Moverman it's more than enough.</Review>
            <Review>Powerful.</Review>
            <Review>If Gere and Moverman get Oscars for it, they deserve them.</Review>
            <Review>The writer and director, Oren Moverman, makes homelessness harshly immersive.</Review>
            <Review>George's plight is both heartbreaking and chilling and his time spent in waiting areas, hostels and subway trains inspires a greater sense of both tenderness and thankfulness.</Review>
            <Review>This is a tough, honourably made drama with a poignant performance from Gere.</Review>
            <Review>You'll share George's sense of weariness as he searches for a simple night's sleep, but more importantly you'll believe in the cold world he inhabits, and the complex plight of those around him.</Review>
            <Review>Everyone listed in the final credits - especially writer- director Oren Moverman - should feel proud of their involvement.</Review>
            <Review>Richard Gere is a quiet knockout in Time Out of Mind, the Oren Moverman film that has for some reason remained as below the radar as its invisible (to the rest of society anyway) central character.</Review>
            <Review>Oren Moverman's film is entirely reliant on Gere's acting qualities, which is rather like relying on the Titanic's buoyancy qualities.</Review>

            <Review>The teen dystopian franchise continues to play rough, and now even rougher, with satisfying results.</Review>
            <Review>With minimal plot development and far too much running around in dark corridors, The Scorch Trials has a poor story:filler ratio. And much of what happens is poorly thought-out.</Review>
            <Review>The sequel is terrible and all my original criticisms for the first film still stand, but at least it's a more entertaining kind of awful.</Review>
            <Review>This story was better off back in the maze.</Review>
            <Review>There's no flare of strangeness or freshness here, just a pile of images and ideas stolen from smarter people's second-hand bin banged into each other for a numbingly dull 132 minutes.</Review>
            <Review>It's a bit bland and won't leave you particularly hungry for more.</Review>
            <Review>Wes Ball keeps the ball rolling at a cracking pace, veers into horror territory with gruesome zombie action and, though the characters don't really develop, elicits genuine performances from his young cast.</Review>
            <Review>There's much to hold the attention: expertly staged, flashlight-strafed chases; vast ruined cityscapes that channel Inception and Escher; and an imaginative fight sequence that plays out on cracking glass.</Review>
            <Review>It's exciting but, there is very little depth or poignancy to the story and while the movie will probably appeal to the fans of the first film, there's not a lot of reason to believe it will convince the rest who are new to the happenings.</Review>
            <Review>More Slickly filmed than the first film, The Scorch Trials picks up where Maze Runner ended and just runs off into the desert the first chance it gets.</Review>
            <Review>Still, there's plenty of fun to be had from the fleet-footed zombies and random nods to Mad Max.</Review>

            <Review>The greatest aspect of "Wolf Totem" is the gorgeous, sweeping cinematography that captures the landscape in breathtaking aerial shots and crystal-clear color. The story has its touching moments but dissolves into disjointed melodrama.</Review>
            <Review>Something ends up lost in translation. Its aspirations of looking and feeling recognizable end up uncomfortable and embarrassing.</Review>
            <Review>There's no denying the beauty of the film's imagery, violent and tender, or the emotional power of the final moment in the boy-and-his-dog love story.</Review>
            <Review>Characters seem carved from a much larger narrative. The landscape and painstakingly trained wolves are the true stars.</Review>
            <Review>Annaud's adaptation of Jiang Rong's Chinese novel is a visual wonder but a dramatic dud, a cut-and-paste mess of plot snippets, illuminated by the occasional inspired visual conceit.</Review>
            <Review>Epic in scope, yet at the same time intensely intimate in its handling of its protagonist's inner life, it's a unique wildlife tale that sets a tribe of humans against a majestic pack of wolves.</Review>
            <Review>While visually stunning, this Chinese French collaboration is melodramatic and narratively disjointed. It is a man-and-his-dog story meets outsider-learning-to-appreciate-a-new culture story, just set in a place unfamiliar to Western audiences.</Review>
            <Review>if the film has a true star, it is the environment itself, which is enormous and daunting, dangerous, yet serene</Review>
            <Review>A true story that manages to seem both mythical and too fantastic to have really happened, Jean-Jacques Annaud's epic 3-D Wolf Totem is ultimately a hymn and a plea for ecological harmony.</Review>
            <Review>The four-legged creatures are more compelling than their two-legged counterparts in this visually stunning 3D adventure.</Review>
            <Review>Annaud and company make a bold environmental statement cloaked in a personal story of one young man's personal growth, change and awareness.</Review>
            <Review>Though Wolf Totem is notable for being a Chinese-scripted-and-shot film that actually offers some kind of critique of the communists, it nevertheless falls into a fairly well-worn story of an outsider growing to appreciate a culture he's come to change.</Review>

            <Review>I got tired of this joke before the movie ended, but I appreciate the gusto with which the filmmakers -- particularly Coffin, with his nimble vocalizations -- carried it out.</Review>
            <Review>With its episodic stream of slapstick gags, Minions has moments of piquant absurdity, but mostly its shrill-but-cutesy anarchy works as a visual sugar rush for the preschool set.</Review>
            <Review>Fittingly, because they're pill-shaped, the Minions work best in small doses.</Review>
            <Review>There's plenty of high-velocity comic inanity on display to keep kids happily diverted. But the movie's major flaw is an extension of its own premise: Search as they may, the minions never find a villain worthy of their subservience.</Review>
            <Review>It's not whether this prequel can mint money; that's a given. The questions is: Can the minions carry a movie all by their mischievous mini-selves? 'Fraid not.</Review>
            <Review>"Minions" is every bit as cute as it's supposed to be, a happily empty-headed animated frolic that rarely pauses to take a breath.</Review>
            <Review>...the relatively short running time results in a general lack of lulls...</Review>
            <Review>The only foreseeable problem with this movie is that parents are going to have to be dealing with wee ones mimicking minion-ese for as long as this franchise shall flourish.</Review>
            <Review>As a film, Minions may not be as clever or heartfelt as the Despicable Me films, but it's still plenty of fun.</Review>
            <Review>When today's youth inevitably look back on their favorite tiny, yellow, goggled henchman, they won't be thinking of this movie.</Review>
            <Review>The film eventually comes to hint at and vaguely explains the connection between Minions and Despicable Me which holds a certain satisfaction in itself, but this will certainly satisfy minion-fans, if not particularly wow the rest of us.</Review>
            <Review>The colourful 3D animation is as first-rate as you'd expect, with Coffin and co packing the film with rich sight gags.</Review>

        <Title>Speedy</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 1928</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>71</Duration>
        <StoryLine>This was comedian Harold Lloyd's last silent film, and one of his most charming. Lloyd's character here is called Harold "Speedy" Swift, an upbeat young man whose fatal attraction for baseball always causes him to lose his jobs. After his latest firing, he impulsively spends a day at Coney Island with his sweetheart, Jane Dillon (Ann Christy). Ann's grandfather, Pop Dillon (Bert Woodruff), meanwhile, has a dilemma -- he runs the last horse-drawn trolley in New York City, and the railway magnates desperately want his route. Since Pop won't sell it to them, they plan to get it by underhanded means. Pop must make his rounds at least once every 24 hours, so the magnates hire thugs to stop him. Speedy hears about this plan and, being gainfully unemployed, takes over the route to protect the old man. But the magnates then steal the trolley, and the climax of the film involves Speedy's dash to find the trolley and get it back to its route before the 24 hours are up. He makes it just in time and then forces the magnates to buy the route for a cool 100,000 dollars. This picture was shot on location in a Manhattan that now looks almost quaint for all its concrete and steel. Baseball legend Babe Ruth had a cameo role, playing himself as a very harassed fare when Speedy is working as a cabbie. Their wild ride ends at the old Yankee Stadium. Other historically interesting sites include Coney Island's Luna Park, and Columbus Circle and Wall Street as they were in 1928. In the film's climax, the trolley has a spectacular crash at the Brooklyn Bridge -- this accident was not planned, but was left in the film anyhow. At the time of this picture's release, Lloyd was a top box-office draw, a bigger moneymaker than Charlie Chaplin (whose releases during the '20s was infrequent) and Buster Keaton (whose quirky comedy wouldn't be fully appreciated for several decades). While Lloyd made some fairly amusing sound films, he never again matched the quality of his silent work.</StoryLine>

            <Review>[Ants are] pests, and that's just a weird place to start for a superhero, especially if he never strays too far from his origins.</Review>
            <Review>At long last Marvel Studios offers up a superhero smaller than its artistic ambitions.</Review>
            <Review>The overwhelming, self-serious sense that we are watching something Very Important blissfully doesn't exist in Ant-Man. It's just plain fun: light, breezy, simple and enjoyable.</Review>
            <Review>What, if anything, holds "Ant-Man" together? First, Paul Rudd, who is laughably unheroic, and has the grace to know as much ...</Review>
            <Review>It's difficult to shake the sense that the film was assembled hurriedly and somewhat haphazardly. Which, from all available evidence, is exactly what happened.</Review>
            <Review>Ant-Man is solid, mid-tier Marvel: nothing spectacular, but entertaining enough. Proceed accordingly.</Review>
            <Review>Ant-Man is a surprisingly nimble, enjoyable origin story with a little-guy-saves-the-day quality that will particularly appeal to younger viewers.</Review>
            <Review>Is Ant-Man worth seeing? (As if my answer matters; like all Marvel movies, it'll make a mint.) Sort of.</Review>
            <Review>The plot is as basic as it gets and in its antagonist-protagonist set-up, almost an exact copy of the Spider-Man-Green Goblin situation. But who cares? When you have a cast delivering comedy this strong, plot would only get in the way.</Review>
            <Review>Ant-Man is at least entertaining without overwhelming, and funny without the pomposity of the recent Marvel onslaught.</Review>
            <Review>Combined with action that shifts the usual Marvel macro battle to micro dazzle, a solid cast and a high-tech heist of a plot, Ant-Man delivers a good thing in a small package.</Review>

        <Duration>101</Duration>
        <StoryLine>The directorial debut from acclaimed artist Takashi Murakami, Jellyfish Eyes brings its creator's endless imagination to the screen in a tale of family, friendship, and loyalty set in a world of fantasy that only Murakami could conjure. Having moved to the country with his mother following the death of his father, young Masashi (Takuto Sueoka) immediately makes a most unlikely friend: a flying, jellyfish-like sprite that he nicknames Kurage-bo. Taking Kurage-bo under his wing and into the classroom, Masashi soon discovers that his schoolmates have similar friends - and that they, their creators, and the town itself are not all they seem to be. Pointedly set in a post-Fukushima world, Murakami's film carries a message of cooperation and hope while boasting unforgettable creature designs and handmade special effects nearly a decade in the making. A touching triumph of creativity and wonder, Jellyfish Eyes is a must-see for film lovers of all ages. (C) Janus</StoryLine>

            <Review>[The] story [is] barely original or interesting enough to sustain a half hour of kids' TV.</Review>
            <Review>Whatever you might think of Mr. Murakami's paintings and sculptures, they are invariably polished and eerily perfect, but his movie seems thrown together.</Review>
            <Review>Watching unmemorable child protagonists repeatedly fight and bond with each other and a bunch of F.R.I.E.N.D.s, tacky-looking Pokémon-esque monsters, is unproductively exhausting.</Review>
            <Review>The creatures -- which range from a human-sized frog to a sprite with a big metal box for a head -- provide a worthy showcase for Murakami's prodigious visual imagination.</Review>
            <Review>Unfortunately, a narrative feature film is more than just moving images, and once Murakami dives into narrative and character, Jellyfish Eyes begins stumbling all over itself</Review>
            <Review>Whatever theories Murakami has perfected in his visual art, he's miscalculated in his feature-filmmaking dabble.</Review>
            <Review>Japanese artist's fantasy film is disappointing, derivative.</Review>
            <Review>The film is rich in the artist's creative imagery, but too thin in its storytelling to captivate a casual audience not already enamored with his work.</Review>
            <Review>At once heavily pretentious and suffocatingly derivative.</Review>

            <Review>Lapid, following his acclaimed 2014 hostage drama "Policeman," clearly has a lot on his mind here. But he tells his overlong story in such a diffuse, at times elliptical way that his reach exceeds its grasp.</Review>

            <Review>Knock Knock, which is about two women wreaking havoc on a married man, aspires to be titillating. But more than anything, both persistently, persuasively angle to make you angry.</Review>
            <Review>The characters are driven by convenience, not behavior, and their actions seem like they've been manhandled into place to make the plot work.</Review>
            <Review>"Director Eli Roth's "Knock Knock," a remake of the 1977 exploitation picture "Death Game," sometimes plays more like a comedy than like the grungy thriller that inspired it, but that's often all to the good."</Review>
            <Review>Knock Knock is a pretty flimsy erotic thriller, but thanks to Reeves' oaken obliviousness it's also got a few moments of deliciously trashy fun.</Review>
            <Review>As a piece of social satire, "Knock Knock" winds up being not just toothless but anticlimactic.</Review>
            <Review>All foreplay and no, well, climax.</Review>
            <Review>Although Keanu Reeves has never been noted for his subtlety as a thespian, his performance as a captive husband in Knock Knock could easily be bettered by a stationary object like a chair.</Review>
            <Review>The movie sits atop three characters that neither Reeves, de Armas nor Lizzo can give enough personality or strength, making for laughable, cartoonish moments. [Full Review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Intriguing spin on home-invasion thriller ... Slickly produced, energetically played, especially by Reeves as the good husband who, when home alone, falls prey to kinky temptations.</Review>
            <Review>Unlike most of his previous films, Eli Roth subtly goes for the jugular with Knock Knock, building to a finale brimming with surreal tension and a wickedly dark sense of humor that left me both cringing and laughing.</Review>
            <Review>Another sub-par effort from director Eli Roth, who finally breaks out of his xenophobia, but sadly for a pretty abysmal thriller.</Review>
            <Review>It's ultimately more interested in being lurid than provocative.</Review>

            <Review>A film trying so hard to upend expectations that it loses itself in the process.</Review>
            <Review>Jeremy Chabriel is arresting as the increasingly uneasy youngster, and director and co-writer Ariel Kleiman proves adept at both world-building and attention-focusing.</Review>
            <Review>It's hard to tell if director and co-writer Ariel Kleiman is being serious or sarcastic with a story this preposterous.</Review>
            <Review>A moody drama that employs a dystopian-type premise that is not too far afield from a typical young-adult book series although with loftier aspirations and a less propulsive pace.</Review>
            <Review>Usually, partisans stand for something, but in this movie, which is stripped of a specific time frame and relevant geopolitical context, the term becomes hollow.</Review>
            <Review>Newcomer Jeremy Chabriel commands as 11-year-old Alexander, a chosen son whose dawning sense of right and wrong challenges the social order. An auspicious beginning, for him and Kleiman.</Review>
            <Review>The storytelling is possibly a little too wilfully obscure, but whenever the protagonists leave the commune's walled-in compound, the desolate urban landscape outside - shot in the former Soviet republic of Georgia - makes a powerful impression.</Review>
            <Review>A patiently unfolding drama that displays the lengths one will go to provide shelter and community, and what happens if you step out of bounds.</Review>
            <Review>With his feature debut, young Australian filmmaker Ariel Kleiman tells a creepy story about a cult-like commune, anchored by a riveting performance from French actor Vincent Cassel.</Review>
            <Review>Kleiman's Dogtooth-esque dark drama paints a weird and disturbing portrait of stolen innocence.</Review>
            <Review>Kleiman has an eye for poetic imagery but the storytelling style is so oblique and dour that this is a jarring and difficult film to watch.</Review>
            <Review>Cassel's subtle and quietly menacing performance helps compensate for a story that drifts along rather aimlessly at times, while Kleiman's dreamy visuals mark him out as a talent to watch.</Review>

            <Review>What a shame Delamarre's sense of occasion couldn't be used for something less inane.</Review>
            <Review>Overall, it feels like no real thought went into neither the writing nor the production process to make The Transporter Refueled a must-see actioner. It may be 'refueled' but it sure looks like it's running on empty.</Review>
            <Review>As an heir apparent to a Louis Leterrier spectacle, it hasn't an extremely high bar to reach, and yet it still turns the process into a boring bodge job.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>Gorgeous and naturalistic shots by cinematographer by Autumn Durald speak volumes, and the atonal, foreboding score by Nathan Halpern creates a sense of dread, though they are ultimately squandered in an underdeveloped story.</Review>
            <Review>"One and Two" never feels as momentous or as angsty as a good story about moody teenagers should, and that's mostly because the film lacks a menacing parental adversary.</Review>
            <Review>The film tries, unsuccessfully, to walk the same eerie, atmospheric trail as "The Village" by M. Night Shyamalan, or any number of Stephen King works.</Review>
            <Review>Sally Draper leaps to the big screen in this slight, sumptuous drama about teleporting teens.</Review>
            <Review>Disparate influences percolate but never quite cohere in Andrew Droz Palermo's first narrative feature One &amp; Two, which while atmospheric and beautifully lensed ends up being a touch too elliptical for its own good.</Review>
            <Review>There are simply too many loose ends to distract us, and too much empty air in which audiences can't help but poke holes.</Review>
            <Review>Quiet and contemplative, One &amp; Two is confident in the story it wants to tell and achieves so with remarkable poise.</Review>
            <Review>It's a very handsomely made film, the performances are very good, and Palermo's understated vision is definitely intriguing. We just can't help wishing that there was a bit more to it.</Review>
            <Review>Every half-hearted plot twist and supposedly startling jolt underlines just how feeble and derivative this all is. The end result is just silly rather than scary.</Review>
            <Review>It's like Terrence Malick were making a superhero origin story. The lack of explanation wouldn't be a problem if the ending didn't feel somehow predictable and lethargic, but the cast help make this watchable.</Review>
            <Review>It looks beautiful and there is an interesting denouement, but it disappoints; the build-up just isn't developed enough for it to matter.</Review>
            <Review>Strong performances across the board render this a frequently involving and moving experience, with the endearing chemistry between the screen siblings making their bond wholly believable.</Review>

            <Review>It's hectic, unsubtle, borderline cartoonish.</Review>
            <Review>The Girl King really should have been an old-school epic full of palace plots, sword-plunging duels, fiery feminist polemic and bodice-ripping raunch. Sadly, it looks and feels more like a middlebrow TV miniseries, stagey in setting, flat in tone.</Review>
            <Review>The film itself is a minor vehicle to deliver Buska's ferocious performance.</Review>
            <Review>The film is a handsomely shot, historically informative pastime.</Review>
            <Review>Stuffy and stilted right from the start.</Review>
            <Review>When Mika Kaurismäki's film isn't drifting into Blackadder territory, its religion vs science debates draw unflattering comparisons with superior Scandi drama A Royal Affair.</Review>
            <Review>Malin Buska's pointedly manly performance as Kristina (a role that has been previously essayed by Greta Garbo and Liv Ullmann) -- all strides and swordplay -- is one of those heavily stylised turns that is either genius or folly.</Review>
            <Review>The story of Queen Kristina is an incredible, multi-faceted one, not quite done justice to.</Review>

            <Review>A midnight movie for those fine with dozing off about twenty minutes in, once the charm of its single sentence log-line has worn off.</Review>
            <Review>While directors Jonathan Milott and Cary Murnion want to have their laughs and horror, too, the film is something of a zombie itself: half-alive and bloody, but lacking any heart.</Review>
            <Review>With "Cooties," what starts as recess fades all too rapidly into movie detention.</Review>
            <Review>It's not really funny enough to achieve grown-up cachet, and it's too ugly and violent for younger viewers.</Review>
            <Review>What could have been an amusing and entertaining zombie flick is, instead, a slog.</Review>
            <Review>If you have always had the sneaky suspicion that children are little monsters, well, this movie is firmly on your side. It smartly blurs the line between pint-sized terror and flesh-eating hellion because really, who can tell sometimes?</Review>
            <Review>A delicious treat for gorehounds, as well as those who survived elementary school as a child or an adult.</Review>
            <Review>A good movie to pass the time and that's it, in the end you feel like they could've done more with it. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>An entertaining film full of blood, guts, dark humor and very politically incorrect situations. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>This subversive horror-comedy puts a fresh spin on zombie clichés, and also falls just on the right side of bad taste.</Review>
            <Review>It's got an inspired setup, but then wastes it on a half-baked plot, a tepid sense of humor and a preoccupation with one-upping itself with its admittedly solid gore effects.</Review>

            <Review>You can all but feel the heat of blazing candles in the Orthodox pre-Easter ritual of the Holy Fire in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the most impressive scene in a dazzling film.</Review>
            <Review>The film is at its most moving, paradoxically, when the camera gets down to street level, seeming to squeeze, for example, into a small shop in the walled Old City, where two men play backgammon amid claustrophobically over-hung racks of trinkets.</Review>
            <Review>Laudable for turning armchair tourism into a breathtaking experience - a viewer can truly feel as if he or she has gone inside a number of fantastic, ancient places.</Review>
            <Review>This IMAX spectacular largely does what it's supposed to: fascinate, educate, and visually wow the audience, in 45 minutes or less.</Review>
            <Review>The film effectively answers why this one place, not even a square kilometre in size, is such prime religious real estate, but it barely gestures toward the blood that has been paid for it.</Review>
            <Review>Benedict Cumberbatch narrates with effortless authority but it's the personal stories of three attractive young women, present day inhabitants representing the three faiths, which make this a moving and vital production.</Review>
            <Review>You don't just go to Jerusalem. You experience Jerusalem. Those are the words of the director of this phenomenal documentary.</Review>
            <Review>The film unearths some of this history as well, even if at times it feels like a quick course in comparative religion. Its message is familiar -- let's all try to get along -- but the views are remarkable.</Review>

            <Review>Mr. Nossiter's main point is that traditional farming methods have become revolutionary in a country that, we're told, has grown progressively less agrarian. Mr. Nossiter champions that activism in this mellow, unfocused film.</Review>
            <Review>Intense bursts of information highlight the emptiness of some of the more poetic rhetoric in the mix.</Review>
            <Review>Charming if scattershot ...</Review>
            <Review>By focusing on these winegrowers, Nossiter is able to make familiar but still relevant points about globalisation and the potentially disastrous consequences of industrial farming techniques.</Review>
            <Review>An interesting companion piece to the first film.</Review>
            <Review>The film works because, even though the focus is on wine, you know that the issue being explored is universal and could likely be affixed to the production world of any foodstuff you care to name.</Review>

It is estimated that over 400,000 people were imprisoned and 30,000 forcibly disappeared as a result of these government actions. In a letter to his son Pablo, Mendieta confesses the role he played in the abduction, persecution, and execution of countless men and women during his posting to Chile.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Despite numerous missteps and contrivances, "Olvidados" succeeds as an indictment of Operation Condor's horrors.</Review>
            <Review>As if the torture scenes don't already render the film nearly unwatchable, we also have go-for-broke editing.</Review>
            <Review>While it would be a tall order to fully elucidate this complicated history in two hours, "Olvidados" is hamstrung by Mr. Bolado's lack of focused direction and a convoluted plot.</Review>
            <Review>Captures the visceral terror of torture so powerfully that it jars the viewer.</Review>

            <Review>The actors flaunt craft, the script lays on the folksiness with a trowel, and scenes of local color seem to come straight from a guidebook.</Review>
            <Review>It's as if the Scarecrow and the Tin Man got lost and wandered down the Mississippi River, drinking and gambling and stumbling into and out of various troubles, not worrying about their brains or their hearts, just wishing for a little bit of luck.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is a snapshot collage of flyover America, but also, perhaps, an homage to the soon-to-be-lost world of brick-and-mortar gambling.</Review>
            <Review>Even as a road movie this is pretty bland.</Review>
            <Review>This is one of the better movies about the gambling culture in recent years.</Review>
            <Review>Mendelsohn manages to make us simultaneously feel sorry for him and hope, against what seem like steep odds, that he somehow succeeds.</Review>
            <Review>Ben Mendelsohn is amazing as the sick gambler, always willing to sink lower, and also Ryan Reynolds is magnificent and outstanding. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>A loose, funky character study of two guys who can only frame their station as "can't win" and "can't lose," and can't really imagine a life that's anywhere in between.</Review>
            <Review>... a meandering road movie through the byways of American characters who populate the card rooms and dice tables and racetracks, and an oddball buddy movie built on a chance encounter and an instant kinship between two losers gambling their lives away.</Review>
            <Review>Mendelsohn and Reynolds keep us enthralled, waiting to see what the next turn of the cards will reveal.</Review>
            <Review>Ryan Reynolds and Ben Mendelsohn floating down the Mississippi River to gamble and have fun. Should be entertaining, right? Well, it's more a grind than any kind of entertainment.</Review>
            <Review>Mississippi Grind provides a venerable acting showcase to a pair of under-appreciated actors, but could have used more impetus in its execution.</Review>

            <Review>There was a real darkness there - behind the American flags and the fringed jackets and the fireworks - and Being Evel, to its credit, isn't afraid to face it.</Review>
            <Review>It doesn't illuminate the guy's character beyond what's obvious. Nor does it bestow much depth upon Knievel.</Review>
            <Review>"Being Evel" treads a fine line, making it clear that its subject was a heroic symbol of his times and a clear sports innovator while also acknowledging - and there's no getting around this - that the guy was a huge jerk.</Review>
            <Review>A savvy documentary that gives the granddaddy of extreme sports his due while gauging the national climate that welcomed his shrewdly timed arrival.</Review>
            <Review>Even if Daniel Junge's documentary falls a bit short of its goal, it deserves points for trying.</Review>
            <Review>"Being Evel" largely nails his story.</Review>
            <Review>Junge assembled some spectacularly dramatic and telling footage that evokes an era that is no so long ago, but feels so very far away.</Review>
            <Review>Directed by Daniel Junge and produced by stunt star and actor Johnny Knoxville, who also acts as a narrator and host (also a producer) this isn't just a documentary, it is a tribute, even though it doesn't shy away from showing Evel's dark side.</Review>
            <Review>An entertaining film that's both a revealing profile of the man and a thought-provoking reflection on his broader cultural significance.</Review>
            <Review>This is very much a warts and all portrait, but in the process it brings us much closer to its subject, feeds a depth of appreciation many fans of those stunt shows will not have felt before.</Review>
            <Review>Cultural identifiers don't come any bigger, meaner, or influential than Evel (nee Robert Craig) Knievel.</Review>
            <Review>Oscar-winning director Daniel Junge chronicles the man's life and lasting influence through a plethora of hair-raising news footage and the memories of those who knew him, hated him, and still revere him.</Review>

            <Review>An important film to see for parents, students and anyone involved with academia.</Review>
            <Review>Important but devastating viewing.</Review>
            <Review>When and where your frustration and anger boil over while watching "The Hunting Ground" is an individual experience, one that will be different for everyone who sees it.</Review>
            <Review>Too few women (and men) have too little chance to share their stories. Dick's film is a valuable spotlight.</Review>
            <Review>The Hunting Ground qualifies as activist filmmaking. More power to it. You can read all the statistics you want, but there's no substitute for bearing witness - especially in such overwhelming numbers.</Review>
            <Review>The Hunting Ground is a clear piece of survivors' advocacy. Dick's purpose is not to be fair to both sides. But is that such a problem when no one has been fair to his subjects?</Review>
            <Review>Stunning, powerful, infuriating.</Review>
            <Review>A useful picture that should be required viewing at freshman orientation.</Review>
            <Review>U.S. universities have plenty of financial incentives to minimize rape on campus, as this enraging film demonstrates. But there are women fighting back...</Review>
            <Review>...in the moment (hey, there's nothing that says documentarians have to abide by lawful definitions of "innocent until proven guilty", I guess) there is an undeniable power to The Hunting Ground that is hard to ignore.</Review>
            <Review>The whole thing made me fearful for my daughter and ashamed. The Hunting Ground underscores all that and brings to light the faces wronged and those looking to make it stop.</Review>
            <Review>An unnerving expose about the proliferation of rape on college campuses across America.</Review>

            <Review>There are a couple of scenes in Asif Kapadia's new Amy Winehouse documentary, Amy, that make the fame-industrial complex seem rock-bottom awful.</Review>
            <Review>A powerful, and powerfully sad, experience.</Review>
            <Review>A mesmerizing yet devastating look at a singular talent.</Review>
            <Review>It's Amy's words, her music, her voicemails, her home videos, her friends, her family, her tormentors, and her timeless incandescence. Look, listen and weep.</Review>
            <Review>Plenty of folks praise Winehouse in "Amy." But no one was there to save her. Perhaps it wasn't possible. But perhaps it was.</Review>
            <Review>The film is often uncomfortable to watch, prompting that little voice inside each of us to scream out "Somebody help her!"</Review>
            <Review>Amy shows us the vibrant and all-too-vulnerable person behind the tabloid caricature, and will make you hate yourself for ever having laughed at Jay Leno or the many other comedians who used her as the butt of a cheap joke.</Review>
            <Review>The film will leave you feeling exhausted -- it's vibrant, haunting and, I've probably overused it, but also overwhelmingly sad.</Review>
            <Review>Amy is a tough watch, but you must.</Review>
            <Review>Tawdry ... the perfect documentary for an age of leering, intrusive celebrity culture, and enthusiastic, gossipy prurience.</Review>
            <Review>Kapadia's documentary -- which uses home video, archival footage, and clips of concerts and old and new interviews -- feels a bit like a horror film, except the inescapable monster is fame.</Review>
            <Review>The gift of seeing 'Amy' is to witness such a blindingly bright talent, and to realize you don't ever want to be that famous.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Don Piper died Jan. 18, 1989, when a semi-tractor truck crushed his car. Declared dead by the first rescue workers to arrive on the scene, Don's body lay under a tarp for the next 90 minutes. Don's soul, meanwhile, was experiencing love, joy and life like he'd never known before. Don was in Heaven. When another pastor's prayers helped bring Don back to life, he became a living miracle! Yet this is one miracle Don wished never happened. Heaven's bliss was replaced by excruciating pain and emotional turmoil. With the support and prayers of his beloved Eva, their three kids and friends near and far, Don clings to his faith in God and fights to regain a semblance of his previous life. The Piper family's incredible true story of perseverance and overcoming the challenges of life-and death-will bring hope and encouragement to all who see it.</StoryLine>

            <Review>The screenplay is full of infelicitous dialogue far from a plausible vernacular, which wouldn't matter if the movie had an ounce of stylization to justify its fourth-grade-reading-level airport-novel vocabulary.</Review>
            <Review>A better title would've likely been "121 Minutes in Purgatory," since that's essentially where audiences will find themselves residing during the entirety of this dreary slog down a familiar road paved with painfully good intentions.</Review>
            <Review>This inspirational indie earns points by being more bluntly realistic than many other faith-based dramas in its depiction of an ordeal that likely would challenge the faith of even the most devout Christians.</Review>
            <Review>Turns out people can get really irritable after seeing heaven.</Review>
            <Review>Although this well-meaning film may appeal to its intended audience on a spiritual level, the result is a sluggish, clinical, largely dreary portrait that tends to mistake trauma for drama.</Review>
            <Review>It fails to create a satisfying narrative with a true arc that pays off; it's too caught up in explaining its minor details to focus on the big picture.</Review>
            <Review>So deeply terrible that it will make you question the existence of God. The dialogue is the least natural I've ever seen in a film not made by Ed Wood.</Review>

            <Review>Although it's centered around a fascinating true story, 90 Minutes in Heaven is plagued by an uneventful and padded out two hours.</Review>
            <Review>May strike a welcome chord with the evangelical groups at whom it's obviously aimed. But for others the ploddingly preachy picture will seem more like a stint in purgatory, if not someplace even more uncomfortable.</Review>

            <Review>Campanelli's main goal seems to have been to incorporate as many action movie clichés as possible in a single film...</Review>
            <Review>this action thriller never stops moving (except when Olga Kurylenko's kickass heroine Alex has her leg literally caught in a vice), racing through its series of genre routines in the hope that speed alone can cover over any cracks.</Review>
            <Review>With a plot so thin that it's barely there, this sleek South African action thriller is surprisingly entertaining simply because the cast is allowed to chomp merrily on the scenery as they try to torment and kill each other.</Review>

            <Review>A very good film, but only if you're willing to inevitably submit to its anarchic sensibility.</Review>
            <Review>For those fans who don't mind enduring some tedium and confusion, "Yakuza Apocalypse" at least offers something memorably bizarre.</Review>
            <Review>By the end ... you might be as punch-drunk as Kageyama in his final showdown, and too exhausted to care.</Review>
            <Review>Lurid and nutso doesn't even begin to describe this opus. You have to see it to believe it ... if you have the stomach for it.</Review>
            <Review>Directed by the inimitable Takashi Miike... Apocalypse finds the 55-year-old filmmaker at his silliest, which is saying a lot, as he's responsible for some of the silliest movies ever made.</Review>
            <Review>This is not a great film, yet for the right audience it could be an entertaining one.</Review>
            <Review>Its subtle victory (though maybe its central weakness as well) is its denial of quick, easy fanboy pleasures.</Review>
            <Review>... back to the wild and weird Miike, with extreme action, bloody spectacle, goofy humor, and abrupt curveballs every time you think you think you've got a handle on it.</Review>
            <Review>If you're a Miike fan or simply looking for something weird and wonderful then you certainly won't forget this in a hurry.</Review>
            <Review>Slow down, Takashi.</Review>
            <Review>It is extremely mad, long and often tiresome. Yet it is acted with eerie and absolute conviction, and has an interestingly surreal quality; Miike has a claim to be one of cinema's genuine surrealists.</Review>
            <Review>deliriously daft until its final oater-style showdown... Miike delivers something all at once insane, inane and irresistible.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2015</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>86</Duration>
        <StoryLine>A biting, social satire of reality TV and the glorification of those who are "famous for being famous," L.A. SLASHER takes aim at the current state of the entertainment industry, where it is acceptable (and even admirable) to gain influence and wealth without merit or talent - but instead through shameful behavior, and the notoriety that comes from it. Incensed by the tabloid culture that promotes this new breed of "celebrities," the L.A. Slasher publicly abducts a series of reality TV stars, which leads the media and the general public to question if perhaps society is better off without them. (C) Archstone</StoryLine>

            <Review>Fairly awful and useless.</Review>
            <Review>This bloody attempt at satire suffers from comparisons to other movies that did the same thing much better, but also from a flat, facile approach that renders everything slick, soulless, and vacuous.</Review>
            <Review>A good-looking effort but offers no threat, positioning itself as dangerous, chic, and wise when it's mostly muddled and poorly edited.</Review>

            <Review>Thanks to the excellent if a little on the obviously-pictorial-side cinematography by Robert Barocci, you've seen some lovely vistas on the way to indifference.</Review>
            <Review>Remove the charm and the Depression-era aura from "Paper Moon" and you have "Lost in the Sun," a road movie that goes nowhere particularly interesting.</Review>
            <Review>Despite some scenic territory, there's just not much to this journey, leaving "Lost in the Sun" feeling like a short story stretched way too thinly toward feature length.</Review>
            <Review>At every minute in this film, you know where it's going, because nothing that happens in any of the 130 minutes of this film works at all if the movie doesn't get there.</Review>
            <Review>It's a story of redemption and reconciliation that follows a well-worn path and strains credibility as it meanders along.</Review>
            <Review>"Lost in the Sun" is a technically proficient but achingly typical gloomy southern crime drama, one that audiences can seek out if they exhausted every other similar film.</Review>
            <Review>A monotonous bore. Lost in the Sun clearly thinks it's saying something profound, but what it says has been said before, many times, in much better pictures.</Review>
            <Review>Duhamel and Wiggins unfortunately don't have the kind of Paper Moon chemistry that could have helped gloss over some of the harder-to-swallow plot turns.</Review>
            <Review>Admirably performed and skilled at detailing Texan expanse, the feature manages to hit the heart when it counts the most, carrying a promising amount of concern for its characters.</Review>

Through banned online videos, they learn from timeless legends who cross all cultural divides, such as Michael Jackson, Gene Kelly and Rudolf Nureyev. Afshin and Elaheh also learn much from each other, most importantly how to embrace their passion for dance and for one another. (c) Relativity</StoryLine>

            <Review>There would seem to be only one thing that the act of dancing cannot free the characters in Desert Dancer from, and that's the movie they're in.</Review>
            <Review>Desert Dancer strays too frequently into melodrama to have much sticking power.</Review>
            <Review>In his feature film debut, director Richard Raymond keeps the story moving despite some dramatic cliches.</Review>
            <Review>Its depiction of the internal tensions in Iranian politics and culture is not what you'd call super-nuanced, but it is sympathetic to Iran as an entity.</Review>
            <Review>Reece Ritchie brings heart to the lead role, particularly in the decisive solo performance that caps the film. But that sequence is as expressive and alive as the rest of the supposedly movement-loving drama is static.</Review>
            <Review>"Desert Dancer" explores fascinating aspects of present-day Iran but suffers mightily from simplistic and sentimental tendencies.</Review>
            <Review>Raymond might sometimes hit his beats too hard but he does keep his eye on the bigger picture.</Review>
            <Review>Characters' brief moments of freedom are stirringly depicted in Richard Raymond's based-on-fact bio-picture, Desert Dancer.</Review>
            <Review>A lifeless, contrived and remarkably unengaging rallying cry for freedom of expression and self-fulfilment in the face of adversity.</Review>
            <Review>There is so little political depth and dramatic tension in the leaden script that the subversive aspect of Ritchie and Pinto's platonic partnership is almost negligible.</Review>
            <Review>It is montage heavy and toe-curlingly naive.</Review>
            <Review>It strives to be a rousing tale of rebellion, but the over-earnest result is more slow shuffle than kicky capoeira.</Review>

        <Duration>112</Duration>
        <StoryLine>The turbulent production of the Steve McQueen car-racing classic Le Mans serves as the subject of this documentary from filmmakers Gabriel Clarke and Jon McKenna. At the time Le Mans went into production McQueen was one of cinema's biggest stars. Given his choice of film projects thanks to a lucrative deal with Cinema Center Studios, McQueen quickly began work on the passion project he had been dreaming about for the past decade. But as production on Le Mans got underway, the driven star would be forced to contend not only with the sudden departure of the film's original director, John Sturgis, but his own failing marriage, the threat of bankruptcy, and the fear of learning that he had been targeted for death by one of the most notorious serial killers of the 20th Century as well.</StoryLine>

            <Review>If you see only one 44-years-later postmortem on a critical and commercial misfire this season, it might as well be "Steve McQueen: The Man &amp; Le Mans."</Review>
            <Review>"Steve McQueen: The Man &amp; Le Mans" is an interesting documentary because it approaches its well-known subject from an unexpected angle.</Review>
            <Review>Filmmakers Gabriel Clarke and John McKenna interweave abundant archival footage and audio seamlessly.</Review>
            <Review>It doesn't really succeed in conveying McQueen's great passion for auto racing. In truth, it mostly makes him seem like a jerk - but cinephiles might enjoy it as a case study of moviemaking gone wrong.</Review>
            <Review>We've seen many an insider doc about films destroyed by their creators' chutzpah (Overnight, Lost in La Mancha), but what's most wrenching here is McQueen's displays of vulnerability and tenderness.</Review>
            <Review>A passionate tale where the directors know just how much to give us to feel the passion of its main subject. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>A film to exorcise an insecure, violent, unpredictable, angry, seductive, and full of suicidal tendencies Hollywood icon. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>The story of one of the most high octane ego trips in Hollywood history. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>With archival films and frank interviews with people involved like his first wife and his son, this is a fascinating look at what unchecked ego can do to a gifted person.</Review>
            <Review>Like Hearts of Darkness, this documentary follows the making of a movie on which more than a million feet of film was reportedly exposed, but sadly Le Mans is no Apocalypse Now.</Review>
            <Review>There is real poignancy here in the reminiscences of McQueen's former wife Neile Adams and his son, Chad. Like the Le Mans movie itself, the doc sometimes loses its focus but it is beautifully made.</Review>

            <Review>The Hollywood romantic comedy hits an astonishing new low with this disastrous pairing for Pierce Brosnan and Salma Hayek.</Review>
            <Review>Mainly the comic outcomes of these setups are painfully predictable and when they aren't ... they border on the offensive.</Review>
            <Review>A 99-minute film that seems to last for three hours ... one of the worst films to sport the label "romantic comedy."</Review>
            <Review>A string of hackneyed situations and faux "edgy" humor you wouldn't find on even the worst episode of "Frasier."</Review>
            <Review>The sentimental side of the back half of the film doesn't fit with the bedroom farce sensibilities going before.</Review>
            <Review>Sometimes, [the film] wants to be light farce, all repartee and two-dimensional characters; other times it wants to be a contender, with deathbed scenes and motivating lectures on romantic poetry. At all times it's a tremendous waste of talent.</Review>
            <Review>A film like this essentially suffers from what one might call like the domino cliché effect. Once the first cliché hits, it's impossible to stop the rest.</Review>
            <Review>This rom-com ... is so hackneyed it might be more fun counting the cliches than cheering for its male lead, now stranded light years away from his former James Bond glow.</Review>
            <Review>Rather than Pierce giving a lecture on how to be a better person, he should have stuck to bedding the half-sisters played by Jessica Alba and Salma Hayek.</Review>
            <Review>Boring, contrived and witless.</Review>
            <Review>Pierce Brosnan's recent career is not a thing of beauty. Yet again he has plumped for a mildly embarrassing, past-its-sell-by-date part.</Review>
            <Review>One generation's silver fox is another's creepy old sex pest, and Pierce Brosnan doesn't have the comic chops, or even the facial expressions, to bridge the gap here.</Review>

            <Review>The cumulative effect ... is numbing.</Review>
            <Review>The novelty factor fades midway through, and not even the bizarre sight of a (computer-generated) tank rolling down the streets and bombing buildings could really sustain or amplify the flagging energy of it all.</Review>
            <Review>What makes Tokyo Tribe ultimately unique, if still problematic in its sheer amount of chaos, are the underlying politics.</Review>
            <Review>One of the joys of Japanese cinema is how it not only wholeheartedly embraces genres, but also happily mixes them up.</Review>
            <Review>Even to call it a perverted ultra-violent dystopian Japanese gang war hip-hop musical, while covering all the bases, would miss what makes the film so indelible.</Review>
            <Review>The novelty wears out long before Tokyo Tribe is over. That's because there's nothing really happening here except for the execution of the novelty.</Review>
            <Review>Masquerading as a hip-hop martial arts musical, Tokyo Tribe is mostly just a puerile male fantasy come to hypercolor life.</Review>
            <Review>so insistently over-the-top from the start that the results are just fairly amusing when they ought to be exhilarating.</Review>

            <Review>Icily effective.</Review>
            <Review>Beneath it all is the nagging and heartbreaking feeling that these boys have lost their protector. That vulnerability-combined with their isolation, their confusion-can be harder to stomach than some of the more graphic scenes.</Review>
            <Review>Goodnight Mommy is a very disquieting, very suspenseful film, but proceed with caution.</Review>
            <Review>The tension in Goodnight Mommy owes everything to our not knowing who to trust. Things don't always need to come rushing out of the darkness to be frightening.</Review>
            <Review>The tension never lets up.</Review>
            <Review>Here is a horror film that features very little screaming, except from the theater audience.</Review>
            <Review>It is, at times, very exciting and tense. It is also very clichéd.</Review>
            <Review>Goodnight Mommy employs similar psychological tactics found in film noir and the gothic by arousing the same cultural moods of paranoia and mistrust, which have resulted from a disruption to a seemingly, civilized ideal.</Review>
            <Review>A movie that fans of the genre can't miss. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>A great horror exercise filled with intrigue, suspense and a small touch of dark humor. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Intensely disturbing.</Review>
            <Review>It's an eerie, stylish, oddly beautiful and commendably macabre little film.</Review>

            <Review>Plenty of bigger, more grown-up movies could learn a thing or two from its humanity.</Review>
            <Review>Shaun The Sheep is suitable entertainment for anyone who likes to laugh out loud.</Review>
            <Review>Visually appealing and animal friendly, Shaun the Sheep celebrates summer - a break in the routine, loving it on the lam.</Review>
            <Review>The sight gags are so meticulously designed that they often recall Rube Goldberg inventions; much of the fun derives from seeing how the filmmakers pull off their elaborate comic scenarios.</Review>

        </Directors>
        <Reviews>
            <Review>It's a very August sort of movie, the kind that benefits from low, lax expectations.</Review>
            <Review>Nourizadeh, working with a script by Max Landis, plays Mike's bloody violence like visual guitar riffs, and approaches the martial-arts set pieces with heavily underlined wit.</Review>
            <Review>The movie evaporates in the mind, but Stewart and Eisenberg have real movie-star chemistry.</Review>
            <Review>The action-movie absurdity is still in place, but so is Landis' muddy-bloody touch: by the end, Eisenberg's face is a purple, swollen wreck, and rightly so.</Review>
            <Review>The movie has the sleepy vibe of some of those scuzzy '90s crime thrillers. It aspires to Natural Born Killers, but has barely enough competence to get close to something like Feeling Minnesota.</Review>
            <Review>As misfires go, American Ultra can at least claim not to be boring.</Review>
            <Review>American Ultra reworks The Bourne Identity as a slacker comedy with a killer punchline.</Review>
            <Review>Re-title it 'The Bong Identity;' an over the top, silly grind-house-level violent spy-spoof, played very earnestly by Eisenberg and Stewart to surprisingly good comic effect.</Review>
            <Review>American Ultra plays like an episode of Homeland for people too stoned to process the plot of a SpongeBob SquarePants episode.</Review>
            <Review>A loud, ugly, slapdash combination of action movie, pot comedy, criminal romance, and conspiracy thriller - and about as lumpy and ungainly as you'd imagine such a stew would be.</Review>
            <Review>"American Ultra" improbably has more gore and fewer laughs than "American Sniper," a distinction that makes it sound a lot more compelling that it is.</Review>
            <Review>This ultra-violent caper plays like a cross between a 1990s slacker drama and a classic John Woo film.</Review>

            <Review>The movie is mature in the way it handles the regrets of absentee parents and the ways in which their children relate to them. There's a little Hollywood artifice here but not so much that the emotions feel inauthentic.</Review>
            <Review>Streep's latest mom role, as Ricki Rendazzo in Ricki and the Flash, has a light, Mamma Mia! vibe, but it still hits all those hot buttons.</Review>
            <Review>Despite Streep's best efforts, Ricki seems more of a contrivance than a flesh-and-blood character.</Review>
            <Review>The film, which Diablo Cody wrote and Jonathan Demme directed, is a work of bulk-size bogusness. Barely a single scene is convincing.</Review>
            <Review>Just when the story beats start to feel unbearably obvious, the film changes keys, becoming less family dramedy than a concert film.</Review>
            <Review>[Its marketing] undersells the sometimes astringent emotional journey of the movie, not to mention its abiding empathy.</Review>
            <Review>Streep makes us care about Ricki even when she's being a stubborn jerk. It's another astonishing performance by her, in a film just good enough to deserve it.</Review>
            <Review>Its twinkly ads take pains to exclude its more compelling thematic elements. But they're there, and worth seeking out through the fog of the other stuff.</Review>
            <Review>Bedecked in black leather jacket, ratty braids and bad tattoos, Meryl Streep is a blast.</Review>
            <Review>Somehow, between its story and character contrivances and its deathless songs, Ricki and the Flash feels like a rehearsal.</Review>
            <Review>The biggest find in the film is Streep's daughter, Gunner, who proves that she is a strong and emotional thespian just like her mother. Watching her emotional rollercoaster is what truly engages us in this film.</Review>
            <Review>Ricki and the Flash proves to slack in the crowd-pleasing entertainment this exciting triumvirate is slumming for.</Review>

            <Review>When was the last time you saw a modern thriller with so much narrative and visual wit that you were simultaneously laughing and crying out in fear - the kind the Coen brothers often make and Spielberg when he's in a Hitchcockian mood?</Review>
            <Review>At its best, "A Hard Day" has a breakneck pace that allows one to easily dismiss the more ridiculous, downright nonsensical aspects of its plot. Only occasionally will the eyes roll. For the most part, it works.</Review>

The trip is an epic journey of self-discovery, challenged friendships, and iconic landscapes that includes runaway horses, a sassy donkey, perilous mountain passes, rodeo rides, sickness, injury, and death.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Multi-hyphenate Onur Tukel returns to the Tribeca fest with his seventh feature, a comedy so dark that only minimal humor alleviates the film's dour perspective.</Review>
            <Review>Tukel invests most of his narrative making terrible people objects of ridicule, with a final punchline suggesting that, in the game of life, everyone's stuck on one side or the other of the same bad joke.</Review>
            <Review>Applesauce, Onur Tukel's latest and most accomplished microbudget exercise in cynical absurdism, throws dismembered body parts into a couple of amicable marriages and charts the resultant explosions as paranoia runs rampant.</Review>
            <Review>Applesauce is an uncomfortable watch that is blisteringly funny.</Review>
            <Review>Shifting from a vampires to yuppie revenge comedy Applesauce grew on me much like a fungus you learn to love.</Review>
            <Review>The fatal flaw is that they're all uninteresting, no matter how many fingers or toes they end up with.</Review>
            <Review>Applesauce mixes genres (here, a revenge fantasy meets a relationship drama) to create a brightly amusing catalogue of stupid human tricks that doesn't fit neatly into any niche.</Review>

            <Review>Noujaim's film attests to how quickly joyous weeping in the streets gave way to sectarian arguments over the army's role and fissures in promising alliances.</Review>
            <Review>If the resulting film is unwieldy - five editors, five "additional editors," and six assistant editors are credited - it also brims with angry urgency.</Review>
            <Review>The camera becomes a revolutionary: running, chasing, breathlessly jittery, up in the face of interrogators.</Review>
            <Review>Epitomizes nonfiction film not just as a way to deepen knowledge and understanding, but also as an art form.</Review>
            <Review>What does a revolution feel like from the inside? I'm not sure we'll ever get closer than "The Square," an electrifying, at times heartbreaking documentary from the Egypt-born, Harvard-educated documentarian Jehane Noujaim.</Review>
            <Review>If, like me, you watched all this on TV, the ongoing turmoil began to feel like a distant, abstract blur. Noujaim takes us inside this history by centering on three protesters, each from a different background.</Review>
            <Review>Nothing short of literature</Review>
            <Review>While it's significant as a historical document, The Square, simply by existing, also reminds us of how new media has begun to transform the way the world witnesses war and oppression.</Review>
            <Review>Jehane Noujaim's ground-level account of the Arab Spring from 2011 to mid-2013 in Cairo's Tahrir Square has heart, wit, poetry and fire.</Review>
            <Review>Unflinching, violent but excellent docu on Arab Spring.</Review>
            <Review>What does a revolution really feel like? You learn the answer in The Square, an extraordinary documentary that puts its cameras on the ground to take us in the heart of the troubled, betrayed, idealistic and sad movement for democracy in Egypt.</Review>

            <Review>No Escape takes the casual xenophobia of something like Taken, crossbreeds it with something altogether more noxious, then asks us to kick back and enjoy the ride. We don't. We can't. And the ride isn't that great to begin with.</Review>
            <Review>No Escape is as accomplished as it is vicious.</Review>
            <Review>No Escape is bare-bones, shameless, and too obnoxious to stay suspenseful for long.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director John Eric Dowdle makes the street action propulsive, bewildering and terrifyingly real, and things are just getting warmed up.</Review>
            <Review>I won't make a case for No Escape being a good film; the first half is pretty good and the second half ranges from pretty bad to truly awful.</Review>
            <Review>Dowdle sticks closely to the family's perspective, for better and for worse; though fairly effective at conveying their terror, he fails to establish any sort of social or political context for the story.</Review>
            <Review>You're unlikely to see an action-thriller this summer that is as intense as No Escape.</Review>
            <Review>This work manages to dehumanise an entire region while providing little entertainment value.</Review>
            <Review>"No Escape" plays like an "Argo" rewrite by someone who heard about "Argo" from a friend who never saw "Argo."</Review>
            <Review>This appalling escape movie takes racism towards Asians to an extreme not seen for many years in mainstream films.</Review>
            <Review>Seems to suggest that these American lives are more valuable than anyone else's and that's a message, regardless of how unintentional, that many are becoming increasingly wary of. Political correctness aside, it's just bad filmmaking.</Review>
            <Review>A film like No Escape, with its conservative notion of glorifying the wellbeing of one family over anything else, should have already been rendered obsolete.</Review>

            <Review>Guzmán and Cárdenas present this tropical island as both Anne's romantic refuge and Noelí's exploitative landscape, a beautiful, enchanting -- and realistic -- Eden where snakes are merely snakes.</Review>
            <Review>Ms. Chaplin, in one of her most touching screen performances, imbues Anne with a world-weary melancholy that makes your heart sink.</Review>
            <Review>Remarkable sensitivity and exacting verisimilitude are just two of the many selling points for Sand Dollars.</Review>
            <Review>Playing out against a dreamy Caribbean backdrop, Sand Dollars is indeed about dreams, unpicking those of a gracefully aging lady and her young lover with a trembling delicacy and attentiveness.</Review>
            <Review>Shot solemnly, the film feels a little cold and distant. However, among other things, it's worst seeing just to enjoy the view, the culture and the music the Dominican Republic has offer. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Gently moving with raw performances by Geraldine Chaplin and Yanet Mojica and a quietly powerful and haunting ending that compensate for lack of depth in the screenplay.</Review>
            <Review>This is a film filled with longing that, appropriately, leaves us yearning for more.</Review>
            <Review>It's a film with a restless motion, a film about people in transit (on motorbikes, on foot, in life), in which the question of whether to stay or whether to go, and if so where, takes on a special, existential resonance.</Review>
            <Review>It respects and plumbs the feelings of all three main characters while surfacing the economic, ethnic, cultural, and gender power imbalances in their relationships.</Review>
            <Review>A drama that sometimes can be mistaken for reality. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>The movie lacks rythym, it's repetitive and all over the place, it stops the narration falling in love with itself and at the end it tries to pull off a Nouvelle Vague ending that's really predictable. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>

            <Review>It's breezy and elegant - so breezily elegant it can make you laugh out loud from frame to frame.</Review>
            <Review>This is one of those rare instances when a sequel wouldn't just be warranted - it would be welcomed.</Review>
            <Review>While it looks good - Ritchie has always been a slick visual stylist - it's ultimately as passive as an old rerun.</Review>
            <Review>There's still time this summer for another adaptation of a 1960s TV spy series. Generating the same amount of thrills, however, proves to be a true mission impossible.</Review>
            <Review>Though the buddy cop aesthetic is old hat, Cavil and Hammer keep the film afloat...</Review>
            <Review>I enjoyed The Man from U.N.C.L.E well enough, and I suspect you will, too.</Review>
            <Review>It all ends up sounding a bit like The Matrix's Agent Smith doing Roger Moore doing James Bond.</Review>
            <Review>Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer are fine. They're FINE. They're maddeningly, generically fine.</Review>
            <Review>The plot is disposable at best... but [Guy] Ritchie goes all out in reviving the Cold War sixties spy movie style and attitude, recalling Connery's Bond movie with tongue firmly in cheek.</Review>
            <Review>This becomes a film feels like a cover version of a cover version. One that neither sends up old spy cinema nor adds much to it with its trans-Euro express of a plot.</Review>

        <Title>Stations of the Elevated</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>45</Duration>
        <StoryLine>STATIONS OF THE ELEVATED (1981) is a 45-minute city symphony directed, produced and edited by Manfred Kirchheimer. Shot on lush 16mm color reversal stock, the film weaves together vivid images of graffiti-covered elevated subway trains crisscrossing the gritty urban landscape of 1970s New York, to a commentary-free soundtrack that combines ambient city noise with jazz and gospel by Charles Mingus and Aretha Franklin. Gliding through the South Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Manhattan - making a rural detour past a correctional facility upstate - STATIONS OF THE ELEVATED is an impressionistic portrait of and tribute to a New York that has long since disappeared. STATIONS captures the exuberant height of the 1970's graffiti movement in New York, featuring the work of early legends including Lee, Fabulous 5, Shadow, Daze, Kase, Butch, Blade, Slave, 12 T2B, Ree, and Pusher. At a time when graffiti was largely dismissed as vandalism and a symbol of urban decay, Kirchheimer explores it as a form of self-expression and a reaction to New York's social and economic conditions, an artistic counterpoint to the "legalized vandalism" dominating the city's visual landscape in the form of corporate advertising. Juxtaposing the colorful imagery of 'tagged' cars with shots of hand-painted billboards depicting hamburgers and bikini-clad women, STATIONS forces audiences to ask: "What is urban art, and what role does it play in the daily life of a city?"

            <Review>Stations of the Elevated plays like a time capsule, particularly for having no dialogue or plot. It swings to Charles Mingus's hardest bop and evokes a long-gone city, somehow more adult and confrontational even in silence.</Review>
            <Review>The film's range of subjects and ideas quickly expands to probe the exhilaration of city life itself.</Review>
            <Review>Lumbering, skronking, and wondrously paint-bombed, Manfred Kirchheimer's Stations of the Elevated (1981) is a 45-minute proto-hip-hop bliss-out, a masterpiece of train- and tag-spotting ...</Review>
            <Review>Kirchheimer appears more interested in the way the subway interacts with urban life, cutting through neighbourhoods like a scalpel through flesh and how people have taken to the individual subway cars as canvases to educate, provoke, and infuriate.</Review>
            <Review>Kirchheimer relies on formal compositions of New York's subway rail yards, elevated platforms, and surrounding locations to tell a complex tale of environmental and urban dislocation where pop art billboards inform ghetto children..</Review>
            <Review>Director Manfred Kirchheimer brings the graffiti-tagged trains, enormous billboards and quirky architecture of 1970s New York City to life with a fabulous kinetic energy.</Review>

            <Review>While the caper plot has its moments, I kept hoping "Trash" would do more than treat its setting as some curiously unexplainable foreign planet.</Review>
            <Review>A diverting two hours, and an excellent reminder of the wide world of stories out there waiting to be told.</Review>
            <Review>An intensive, propulsive political thriller representing a tautly executed return to form for director Stephen Daldry.</Review>
            <Review>I left the screening having almost fainted from sugar shock.</Review>
            <Review>Trash gets hung up on the "teaching" part-looking to inform the well-off about the struggles of Rio slum-dwellers-and for too long forgets that Mulligan's novel provided a pretty good plot.</Review>
            <Review>Comparisons to "Slumdog Millionaire" are inevitable, but the kinetic "Trash" has a rhythm all its own.</Review>
            <Review>This effectively tense adventure also delivers the heart and heroism audiences love.</Review>
            <Review>The Richard Curtis script has Rooney Mara and Martin Sheen running about Rio evading cliched baddies - and they are outshone by the wonderfully energetic young trio, who turn muck into brass.</Review>
            <Review>Trash is a step up from Extremely Loud's cloying 9/11 exploitation simply by virtue of not being one of the most appalling movies ever made. It's still pretty crummy, though.</Review>
            <Review>Obviously, its heart is in the right place, and one can only hope the story and characters read better in Mulligan's book, but as far as "Trash" the film is concerned, the result is disposable.</Review>
            <Review>... the convoluted plot misses a chance to provide moral complexity and emotional depth.</Review>
            <Review>Has definite moments of sheer cinematic excitement.</Review>

            <Review>Are these guys nuts? Are their egos needy of self-affirmation? Or is there some higher purpose in such inexplicable endeavors? Do some people just have a genetic need to live on the edge?</Review>
            <Review>A triumph of editing and narrative beyond "Are you kidding me?" visuals, Meru is a climbing story with context; biographies are woven in incrementally.</Review>
            <Review>What drives these men? "Because it's there" merely scratches the surface. "Meru" may not answer the question completely - likely nothing can - but it is a thrilling, harrowing attempt.</Review>
            <Review>Chin and Ozturk capture both the astonishing views from the top of the world and soul-searching moments inside a cramped tent dangling from the side of the mountain like a used tea bag.</Review>
            <Review>This is one of the most outstanding documentaries of the year.</Review>
            <Review>Filmed with such grandeur and intimacy that sometimes attempting to figure out how they made the incredible shots almost spoils them.</Review>
            <Review>John Long, a brilliant climbing-literature author of Anker's generation, explains the addiction of extreme alpinism as going to a place where you know you're already dead.</Review>
            <Review>Part awe-inspiring nature documentary, part personal reflective journey, Meru gives equal weight to both of these sides of the coin.</Review>
            <Review>A film about a climb more daredevilish than Philippe Petit's tightrope walk. Brilliantly filmed by the climbers who are as good at cinema as in climbing up the face of a mountain.</Review>
            <Review>Likely to appeal to the extreme sports market and leave the rest of us stranded.</Review>
            <Review>As a spectacle, it offers a vertiginous, first person view of events, but it's equally immersive as candid psycho-drama of survival.</Review>
            <Review>While many of the climbing sequences have a sense of thrill to them, the film as a whole just lacks a narrative oomph to make it anything more than a good film...</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>The acting is uniformly strong and the camera work is winningly claustrophobic, but the film is one note: scene after scene of bullying.</Review>
            <Review>The Stanford Prison Experiment is the kind of movie that raises as many questions as it answers. It's also the kind of film where you want to budget some time for discussion afterward. You won't be able to shake this one off easily.</Review>
            <Review>This is not an uplifting movie, and its progress can be grueling. But it has a lot to say about how we let roles define us, how fragile personalities are and how context shapes reality.</Review>
            <Review>The film works hard to keep up the suspense: how far will the guards go? How much can the prisoners take? At what point, if any, will Zimbardo and his team intervene? And is his experiment scientific? Objective? Humane? Worthwhile?</Review>
            <Review>Watching these young men brutalize each other is troubling enough, but perhaps the film's most interesting angle is how the experiment changes more than its subjects.</Review>
            <Review>Billy Crudup gives a fine performance as Dr. Philip Zimbardo, who engineered the whole thing and was then pulled into his own power trip.</Review>
            <Review>Crudup's Zimbardo shifts from ruthlessness to panic, but that shift isn't nearly as marked as what we observe among his subjects.</Review>
            <Review>Crudup excels as Zimbardo, casually sliding into the role of evil prison boss so subtly that we almost don't realize what's happening.</Review>
            <Review>Based on real events, this sharply well-made film shifts from a rather light-hearted comedy into a horrific thriller. And it feels unnervingly natural as it does so.</Review>
            <Review>Cranking up the tension by gradually moving his camera in closer and closer to his actors, Alvarez smartly shrinks the distance between them and us in order to intensify the what-would-you-do? discomfort the experiment was designed to explore.</Review>
            <Review>The film runs out of steam by about the half way mark, where matters of unequivocally passed through the gates of Hell.</Review>
            <Review>Alvarez directs without artifice, his flat tracking shots emphasising the repetition of "prison" life and the sadism of the guards.</Review>

            <Review>It's the perfect one-last-blast movie for the end of summer.</Review>
            <Review>It's as if a Michael Lewis story or a 1980s Paul Schrader movie were intercepted by studio marketing execs who said, "You should turn Saturday Night Fever into a commercial for SunnyD."</Review>
            <Review>Director Joseph captures the vital energy and druggie haze of EDM parties, providing a peek into a world not often seen on the big screen.</Review>
            <Review>Its poignance comes from the film's desire to treat the aspirations and emotions of its tender-hearted, kinda dim hero seriously while maintaining enough distance to feel wiser and more mature than he is.</Review>
            <Review>It's all big, dumb, broad strokes, with plot points visible from miles away. But it works where it matters: The music is fantastic, and the film invests you in its central relationship.</Review>
            <Review>Efron is a natural and likeable presence on screen and has proven to be a pretty decent actor in films like Hairspray and The Paperboy. But the problem with "regularness" is that, in the wrong hands, it's kind of dull.</Review>
            <Review>'We Are Your Friends' is a big-screen soap opera-all beautiful people, all the time, who wear very small bathing suits, and jump up and down near swimming pools to 128 bpm.</Review>
            <Review>With endless talk of BPM and EQ levels, DJ-ing is - at best - inherently uncinematic and, at worst, dull as a dust cover.</Review>
            <Review>We Are Your Friends is an entertaining film, if only to pass the time. But it won't give you anything deep or meaningful; it's one of those movie options to enjoy with the kind of friends with no interest in cinema at all. [Full Review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Not unlike the generation it's trying to represent, We Are Your Friends never really takes the time to consider what it would like to say.</Review>
            <Review>The execution is so laden with dated stylistic quirks that it feels like a relic from the late 1990s. The plot is pretty cookie-cutter too.</Review>

            <Review>[Pegi Vail's] documentary about the effects of global tourism... should be mandatory viewing for anyone who's ever thumbed through a Lonely Planet guidebook with an eye toward visiting an exotic destination.</Review>
            <Review>This well-meaning but superficial film skips across the globe, raising some provocative arguments but advancing few.</Review>
            <Review>Vail's film earnestly interrogates authenticity even as her camera lingers on a beach without footprints, inviting the viewer to walk.</Review>
            <Review>While the film includes numerous images showing plastic detritus and tire tracks, it also offers several testimonies by travelers relating specific experiences.</Review>
            <Review>It isn't perfect and could have been much tougher-minded - especially about the country's "selling" of tourism - but this film should start a necessary and overdue conversation.</Review>
            <Review>Pegi Vail beautifully edited film somehow addresses a lot, but ultimately says little.</Review>
            <Review>An excellent mix of context and history with a perfect meld of first person and third person points of view. Gringo Trails is a profound new documentary about the nature of man's relationship to Planet Earth.</Review>

            <Review>We see-almost from the inside-the evolution of Cobain's sensitive brilliance and the art and destruction that it fed.</Review>
            <Review>Morgen and his editors have simply done a remarkable job -- also an artful one -- in piecing together this residuum.</Review>
            <Review>On the subject of the life and death of Kurt Cobain there is still some work to be done, but Montage of Heck may be as close as we'll get to moving on.</Review>
            <Review>A masterful and often deeply moving portrait of a volatile American genius, a portrait that goes far beyond one man, one family and one rain-sodden small town.</Review>
            <Review>Cobain's life has been chronicled in scores of books and documentaries, but Montage of Heck feels fresh in the scope of material it includes, the way it's presented, and the things it emphasizes.</Review>
            <Review>Montage understands Cobain as an icon, but also as the mixed-up kid who got too famous too fast, and it seems content revealing, rather than reconciling, his contradictions.</Review>
            <Review>It's a rare profile that's about the person instead of the personality, the artist instead of the art.</Review>
            <Review>Montage of Heck isn't an investigation into its subject's death so much as an homage to his creativity and life force -- it's tender and sad.</Review>
            <Review>Montage of Heck makes the tragic end of Cobain's life more heartbreaking through it's delicate retelling of his 27 years.</Review>
            <Review>Montage of Heck is about the representation and self-representation of Kurt Cobain, a fascinating process for any figure whose entire fame was based on modes of self-representation.</Review>
            <Review>Morgen's movie is an eye-level, straight-on gaze at the soul that would turn rock music on its head when it was so desperately needed.</Review>
            <Review>Montage of Heck is an insightful, moving mosaic that works to immerse you, for better or worse, inside Kurt Cobain's creative process and personal demons.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2015</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>78</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Under a baobab tree, an old man tells a story to the children around him: The story of the everlasting friendship between Maki, a little boy aged 10, and Zarafa, an orphaned giraffe, a gift from the Pasha of Egypt to the King of France, Charles X. Hassan, Prince of the Desert, is instructed by the Pasha to deliver Zarafa to France. But Maki has made up his mind to do everything in his power to stop Hassan from fulfilling his mission and to bring the giraffe back to its native land - even if it means risking his own life - because he must fulfill his promise to Zarafa's late mother. During an epic journey that takes them from Sudan to Paris, passing on the way through Alexandria, Marseille and the snow-capped Alps, they have many adventures, crossing paths with the aviator Malaterre, a pair of unusual twin cows called Mounh and Sounh, and the pirate queen Bouboulina.</StoryLine>

            <Review>In trying to tell an epic tale over just 78 minutes, the filmmakers sacrifice anything that might have made their film memorable.</Review>
            <Review>This hand-drawn French adventure is a children's story in the routine template of many friends-and-villains quests, but with a fresh historical setting and a serenely subdued look.</Review>
            <Review>Since there are giraffes in Parisian zoos, there necessarily had to be a first one, and Rémi Bezançon and Jean-Christophe Lie's Zarafa is a beautifully animated and often moving telling of how it arrived there in the early 1800s.</Review>
            <Review>While the gorgeous widescreen landscapes have a pencil-and-aquarelle quality, the characters themselves are literally rougher-edged, a clever reminder of the hand-drawn, sketchlike quality of traditional animation.</Review>
            <Review>A colorfully compelling kids flick with darker historical undertones, Zarafa reps a smart and successful freshman animation effort from writer-director Remi Bezancon.</Review>
            <Review>Gently told, but with wild flights of imagination involving hot-air balloons, nomads and spectacular scenery, it's a charming adventure, undercut with wise observations about big themes ...</Review>
            <Review>Zarafa is a gorgeously delicate hand-drawn animation about the first giraffe to make the perilous journey from Africa to 19th-century Paris.</Review>
            <Review>The Kirikou movies were livelier.</Review>
            <Review>Although the animated characters have a detailed, Disney-friendly feel, there is little of the sentimentality that tends to fur the teeth of US animation.</Review>
            <Review>The film veers from quasi-real to cartoonily silly and scenes either drag or whirl by too fast.</Review>
            <Review>A return to animation in its most glorious form-beautiful, inspired, often laugh out loud, and most of all touching.</Review>
            <Review>Enchanting African fable with some scares and sadness.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>A sci-fi thriller so derivative of John Frankenheimer's masterfully paranoid Seconds it would be more accurate to call it Thirds, Tarsem Singh's Self/less is a generic waste of a clever idea.</Review>
            <Review>Tarsem Singh has a reputation for making movies that are visually stunning but woefully inert and convoluted in their storytelling (see The Cell and The Fall). Singh's most recent film, Self/less, lives up to at least half of that reputation.</Review>
            <Review>What starts out as an interesting exploration of identity soon gives way to the uninspired, generic action flick we had feared it always was.</Review>
            <Review>Deep under the skin of this shrug of a movie is a solid metaphor rooted in an appealing fantasy.</Review>
            <Review>There's no reason to spoil what follows except to say that even by the standards of both Alfred Hitchcock and science fiction, it's nonsensical.</Review>
            <Review>Self/less is so restrained that I wonder if somebody stole Tarsem Singh's body, too.</Review>
            <Review>The story never manages to convince us that Damian may be at times changing because of some residual sense of Mark, and it never defines the moment when Damian decides to become a decent human being.</Review>
            <Review>Part debacle, part footnote, sure to remind viewers of the better films they could be watching if they weren't such lousy decision makers.</Review>
            <Review>Favouring style-over-substance, there are no real or meaningful contributions to the sci-fi cause in Self/less which ends up being a forgettable affair.</Review>
            <Review>There is no spark, identity or glimmer of freshness in this film. Let's put it this way, it has no sense of "self."</Review>
            <Review>A slick, but dated and hollow jaunt through the ripple effects of over-reaching technology and the questions of morality that accompany such power.</Review>
            <Review>Lacking the lame humour of Mirror Mirror and the ultra-violence of Immortals, this opts instead for glossy, pretentious dullness, with a shameless script that's very much a Hollywood factory second.</Review>

            <Review>Schumer's performance is a tour de force of razor-sharp comedic timing.</Review>
            <Review>The title of the movie suggests its heroine is in need of repair, but the early sequences of her tottering home in high heels and sneaking outside during a date to get high defy condemnation.</Review>
            <Review>You forget how limited so many movies' ideas of women are until Schumer launches into an extended tampon joke. It's a film about everyday sexism and double standards.</Review>
            <Review>This is a film that belongs not to its director but to its star, who, if there is any justice in the world, is about to ascend from cult icon to mass phenomenon.</Review>
            <Review>It's got no rhythm or reliable comfort zone. The jokes and ensemble scenes are all rushed, so you can't savor them or what anyone in them is doing.</Review>
            <Review>Trainwreck ... has some very traditional romantic comedy elements, including a big, implausible finish. But even if you know where you're going to wind up, it takes interesting side trips along the way.</Review>
            <Review>One of the funniest movies I've seen this year, suffused with the sort of raunchy sentimentality that made [Apatow's] previous films such amusing romps.</Review>
            <Review>It's great. As is the closing hip-hop dance number. It's not close to groundbreaking as anything she's done on her show, but Trainwreck adds another dimension to an exciting performer.</Review>
            <Review>Trainwreck is a complete blast. Even as it sends up rom-com clichés, it manages to be both seriously funny and genuinely romantic.</Review>
            <Review>What distinguishes Trainwreck from those that've come before is Schumer's loud, original, versatile voice.</Review>
            <Review>This movie is comedic gold; brilliant acting by all-Amy Schumer, Bill Hader, and Lebron James shine. A sure (R-rated) crowd pleaser. Keep kids under 14 at home.</Review>
            <Review>The only saving grace of Trainwreck is seeing Tilda Swinton in fake tan.</Review>

            <Review>Part of what makes Terminator Genisys so pitiful as an evening out is that all the actors do over and over again is tell us why they're in a particular scene and why the movie exists.</Review>
            <Review>Of course the special effects are more impressive than ever. But nearly every curveball offered up in this new parallel-universe version of the Terminator world isn't as interesting or as original as the timeline we loved in the first place.</Review>
            <Review>Terminator: Genisys, however, has none of the stakes, and none of the moral preoccupations, of its predecessors.</Review>
            <Review>"Terminator Genisys" is the first fully worthy successor to Cameron's original films and it shows Arnold may be old, but he's not obsolete.</Review>
            <Review>Screenwriters Laeta Kalogridis and Patrick Lussier pile on so many pulpy sci-fi conceits -- involving time travel, alternate realities, and the end of civilization -- that you might be carried along by the batty excess.</Review>
            <Review>Sci-fi franchise reset that grafts a new storyline onto the 1984 original... The result looks like, oh I dunno, a 67-year-old skinjacket sagging off the skull-plate of an outdated T-800 Terminator.</Review>
            <Review>I liked it more than I thought I would, though I'm still not entirely sure I, you know, liked liked it.</Review>
            <Review>Sarah Connor's taught Schwarzenegger's T-800 to smile. Maybe it looked good on paper. Never warm up a terminator. If it's not deadly, it's in danger of becoming a goofball.</Review>
            <Review>My complaint isn't based on nostalgia or generational grumbling; it's a fair demand for creativity in a blockbuster sea when movies seem to have taken the audience, unfairly, for granted.</Review>
            <Review>Does little more than remind you how good Terminator once was.</Review>
            <Review>The most useless "Terminator" film to date, one that erases all "Terminator" films to date except the one it needed most to erase - itself.</Review>
            <Review>Terminator Genisys is the first of what has been described as a new, standalone trilogy, but if the first film is anything to go by, fans will most likely be throwing their hands in despair at what's to come.</Review>

            <Review>"Tangerine" has generated interest partly because it was made using iPhones augmented by other devices. But technology can only take a film so far - it's the story that really matters.</Review>
            <Review>Smart, antic comedy that's eager to offend.</Review>
            <Review>Baker gets great, sly, unforced performances from his two leads, but it's not all a rollicking good time: There are moments of quietude, inquietude, moments when a sense of wariness and loneliness settles over the women.</Review>
            <Review>"Tangerine" is the wildest screwball transgender comedy since Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon donned lipstick, mascara and full-tilt female get-ups in "Some Like It Hot."</Review>
            <Review>Rodriguez and Taylor are terrific. Their confidence is infectious, yet they never let us forget the challenges their lives offer.</Review>
            <Review>It's not the technology and law-breaking that make this movie so ingeniously unique. It's the people, the place, the electric sense of movement and the biting sense of humor.</Review>
            <Review>Sun-baked Tangerine zips through with the raw power of an underground movie... The humour is streetwise and borders on pandemoniac, and the two leads, so nutty and yet so honest in their nuttiness, slowly grow on you.</Review>
            <Review>It exudes a terrific, urgent energy that elevates it far beyond its grubby milieu into a handsome and touching portrait of human beings struggling to stay afloat. Highly recommended.</Review>
            <Review>Tangerine is a very dynamic film, owing to its great rhythm that oozes humor and presents these extreme and decadent characters with a great dose of sweetness. [Full Review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Buzzing with life, energy and salty wit.</Review>
            <Review>The best LA Christmas movie since Die Hard, Tangerine is destined to become a landmark in American independent cinema. It is absolutely essential viewing.</Review>
            <Review>Baker presents possible points of empathy with his characters, but they rarely work. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>

            <Review>As someone who neither hungers for yet another incarnation of this character nor understands why anyone would, I watched in subdued bafflement.</Review>
            <Review>The mystery subplot lacks the ingenuity of the greatest Holmes stories, but McKellen excels, switching effortlessly between the reclusive beekeeper with a faltering memory and the elegant younger detective at the height of his powers.</Review>
            <Review>It's a gripping little tale, to be sure, but it's more than that. Somewhere in its tangle of timelines, false starts, and red herrings is a great truth about the unsolvable mystery of the human soul.</Review>
            <Review>Even those who've read the book can be startled by what happens in Mr. Holmes, while they're being moved by McKellen in a role he's come to late, but with his customary elegance.</Review>
            <Review>[An] intriguing if only semi-satisfying Sherlockian enterprise.</Review>
            <Review>The best of it, as in Condon's other movies, are the details of emotions, fleeting but just as quickly caught - true concern camouflaged by flashes of impatience, unutterable despair masquerading as simple grief.</Review>
            <Review>... really about all those human experiences Holmes is least equipped to confront: friendship, compassion, human connection, the reasons to continue living as his sharp intellect loses its edge.</Review>
            <Review>[McKellen's] portrayal of a cantankerous, doddering old man is flawlessly done, but also somewhat generic.</Review>
            <Review>The story is an intricate puzzle though never even slightly difficult to follow. But in the end, it's a testament to the process of writing as a way of coming to terms with one's past, and a celebration of the redemptive power of fiction.</Review>
            <Review>The detective ducks into a movie theater and finds himself watching a (heroic) film version of himself. His response - a snicker tinged with melancholy and disdain - speaks volumes about the futility of trying to dictate how we will be remembered.</Review>
            <Review>Graceful and elegiac, Mr. Holmes is a poignant meditation on mortality that just so happens to feature the world's greatest detective in the lead.</Review>
            <Review>Mr Holmes is a quiet triumph whose ripples will keep washing over you long after you've left the cinema.</Review>

        <StoryLine>The world knows Paul Newman as an Academy Award winning actor with a fifty-plus year career as one of the most prolific and revered actors in American Cinema. He was also well known for his philanthropy Newman's Own has given more than four hundred and thirty million dollars to charities around the world. Yet few know the gasoline-fueled passion that became so important in this complex, multifaceted man's makeup. Newman's deep seeded passion for racing was so intense it nearly sidelined his acting career. His racing career spanned thirty-five years Newman won four national championships as a driver and eight championships as an owner. Not bad for a guy who didn't even start racing until he was forty-seven years old.</StoryLine>

            <Review>For longtime fans of Paul Newman, "Winning" provides valuable insight into the sport he loved. For millennials that might be only vaguely familiar with this old-time movie star, it's a lesson in how one should live a life.</Review>
            <Review>Hagiography? Maybe a little, but for fans of the actor, it's a must-see.</Review>
            <Review>The portrait that emerges of Newman is of a decent, cool and low-key guy who preferred racing over acting. In his own words, "the only grace I ever found was in an automobile."</Review>
            <Review>As passionate about its subject as the actor was about driving, Winning: The Racing Life of Paul Newman provides a fascinating footnote to his distinguished cinematic career.</Review>
            <Review>This energetic film satisfyingly brings viewers up to speed on Newman's remarkably enduring career detour.</Review>
            <Review>I don't doubt Carolla's respect for the material -- he himself is a racer, and owns and drives several of Newman's cars. But he's stretching a few interesting anecdotes out to feature length, and you can feel the strain on the material.</Review>
            <Review>A great surprise and a documentary that should get consideration from movie fans and racinf enthusiasts alike...after all, this film proves that those sects aren't all that different.</Review>

            <Review>Unbelievable indeed, the film, directed by José Manuel Cravioto, nevertheless manages to captivate throughout.</Review>
            <Review>Director José Manuel Cravioto, in his English-language debut ... attempts to subvert the sadly commonplace "woman in captivity" narrative, but mostly only succeeds in testing the limits of our gore tolerance.</Review>
            <Review>With grounded performances from Ivlev and Tyson, this is an excellent indie thriller that tries to do something a little different from the norm.</Review>
            <Review>Its message remains muddled at best as it tries, and fails, to effectively comment on the consequences of rape culture.</Review>
            <Review>A pretty straight forward film that touches familiar ground but it's full of energy. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Though it begins with a certain amount of promise, Bound to Vengeance ultimately becomes as tedious and interminable a horror endeavor as one can easily recall.</Review>
            <Review>"Bound to Vengeance" holds one's attention, but not one's faith, telling a story that simply has too many holes to buy into it.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately a daft, pulpy descent into stylized nastiness.</Review>
            <Review>Ivlev's spirited performance is undermined by the fact that her character's actions are so far-fetched, it would be easier to believe if she sprouted wings and flew out of captivity.</Review>
            <Review>I recommend it only to a niche audience that can appreciate this kind of exploitative fare.</Review>
            <Review>José Manuel Cravioto's wants so badly to work the femsploitation angle, but has no functional understanding of the crucial factors that distinguish between the good and bad apples.</Review>
            <Review>It trivializes victim trauma by treating its main character's best-laid plans as punchline fodder.</Review>

            <Review>Expertly assembled to draw out the suspense of danger lurking around each vacant hill... the movie creates a world of paradoxical sentiments: immediate decision-making pitted against the immovable forces of ideology and moral codes.</Review>
            <Review>Mortensen's post-Lord of the Rings choices have been an idiosyncratic mix: His my-way-or-the-highway approach doesn't always pay off, but it does here with engrossing results.</Review>
            <Review>What makes it work is the solemn efficiency of director David Oelhoffen's storytelling and the quiet intensity of the two leads: The rough tenderness of Mortensen's gaze plays off well against Kateb's conflicted demeanor.</Review>
            <Review>Something of a Distinguished Slog.</Review>
            <Review>Surprisingly affecting.</Review>
            <Review>Camus sets the movie's initial course, but Mr. Oelhoffen resolutely steers it home with political context, historical hindsight, an unambiguous moral imperative and a pair of well-matched performances; put another way, he makes the story his own.</Review>
            <Review>Viggo Mortensen finally finds the right vehicle for his simmering tough guy intensity.</Review>
            <Review>As Westerns go, it is certainly well outside the mainstream, but this small film will linger in the mind longer than most shoot-out standards.</Review>
            <Review>This imbalance in the screenplay keeps Far From Men from its chance at greatness. Nevertheless, its strong stance of taking the side of humanity, even in the face of a civil war in which sides are expected to be taken, deserves respect and applause.</Review>
            <Review>It's a somber-and hopeful-elegy to a time of conflict and one that could draw parallels to many wars, including the one currently raging on between Israel and Palestine.</Review>
            <Review>Viggo Mortensen stars in Far From Men, and he's the main reason to catch it, as he delivers an understated performance of subtle power without ever beating you over the head with it.</Review>
            <Review>A mostly absorbing trek, bolstered by the ominous, enveloping sweep of Guillaume Deffontaines's cinematography and Warren Ellis and Nick Cave's sparse, starkly haunting score.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2015</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>92</Duration>
        <StoryLine>MY ITALIAN SECRET tells a heroic story that was all but lost to history, until now. The film recounts how WWII bicycling idol Gino Bartali, physician Giovanni Borromeo and other Italians worked with Jewish leaders and high-ranking officials of the Catholic Church, risking their lives by defying the Nazis to save thousands of Italy's Jews. Their high-risk methods were ingenious. Bartali, a Tour de France champion, criss-crossed Northern Italy transporting fake identification documents in the frame of his bicycle. A physician, Dr. Borromeo, invented a fictitious disease to scare the SS away from the hospital where he was hiding Jews. Others disguised Jewish girls and women as nuns and hid them in convents. In this epic documentary, living characters return to Italy to reveal their stories, and to thank those who were willing to sacrifice their own lives to save strangers without ever seeking recognition or reward for their courage. Oscar (R)-nominated director Oren Jacoby resurrects the dramatic story of this secret underground, giving it the attention it so richly deserves. (C) The Film Sales Company</StoryLine>

            <Review>The major strength of "The Girls in the Band" is its abundant, crisp footage of women playing at the highest level, from pianist Lil Armstrong (Louis' wife) to contemporary reed player Anat Cohen.</Review>
            <Review>The movie meanders a bit in the beginning, though the information comes across. Then it gets into a chronological groove after about 30 minutes and finds its proper form.</Review>
            <Review>"The Girls in the Band" is a story of perseverance and passion - and is recommended viewing for basically every music fan.</Review>
            <Review>Director Judy Chaikin, who co-wrote the film with its deft editor, Edward Osei-Gyimah, infuses this fine portrait with grace, nostalgia and a well-calibrated dose of social commentary.</Review>
            <Review>"The Girls in the Band" is everything a worthwhile documentary should be, and then some: engaging, informative, thorough and brimming with delightful characters.</Review>
            <Review>Undeniably achieves its primary purpose of making viewers walk out of the theater knowing a lot more about the subject than when they entered.</Review>
            <Review>Judy Chaikin's loving documentary about vaudeville, big bands, and jazz, is a standout...</Review>
            <Review>Among those rare, delightful music documentaries, in the vein of Standing in the Shadows of Motown, that provokes you emotionally and intellectually while remaining entertaining throughout.</Review>
            <Review>A euphoric, triumphant documentary, in which these unsung female jazz musicians get the last word too. As when one recalls when asked by a reporter, 'what's it like to be a female composer' she replies, 'what's it like to be a male journalist.'</Review>

            <Review>I'm all for bawdy, politically incorrect, wildly inappropriate humor -- when there are consistent and genuine laughs to be mined from the material.</Review>
            <Review>You can't do much worse at the movies than Vacation.</Review>
            <Review>There's so much dead air in the film that I wondered whether punchlines had been cleaved out to secure a PG-13 rating, but no: it's a hard, inexplicable R.</Review>
            <Review>It's as if Daley and Goldstein started with a list of disgusting topics - outré sex acts, human waste, pubic hair, projectile vomiting, cow cannibalism, et al. - and constructed a narrative around them.</Review>
            <Review>Helms' Griswold is a dangerous, moronic maniac, and the filmmakers' disdain for him rubs off on the audience.</Review>
            <Review>It holds on to the original's acrid cynicism for the first 40 minutes or so before turning predictable and bland. There are some real, nasty laughs to be had here, but they're front-loaded.</Review>
            <Review>Wacky hijinks ensue, some of them very funny, some dipping desperately into bad taste, some just falling flat. (Which, it's worth remembering, was the case with even the best films of this franchise.)</Review>
            <Review>It's a good indication of what to expect: a crass comedy that unfortunately fails to capture the charm of the original film.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately "Vacation" 2015 is an unknowing spoof, aping a series of - rightfully or not - beloved films without understanding at all what made them tick.</Review>
            <Review>Vacation is definitely not the smartest of films and unlike the original, people will soon forget about its very existence.</Review>
            <Review>The writers have decided that the more dirty words you stuff in an 8-year-old's mouth, the funnier he becomes. Even before the family leaves Chicago, the audience longs for them to visit a bar-soap factory and feed Junior a few samples.</Review>
            <Review>This road trip isn't as bad as you might have heard, but it's not a journey I can honestly recommend taking.</Review>

        <StoryLine>"Elf: Buddy's Musical Christmas" combines the humor and spirit of both the beloved 2003 holiday film, which drew glowing reviews and earned $173 million at the domestic box office, and the hit Broadway production. The special is an all-new retelling of Buddy's delightfully absurd yet heartwarming story and blends the look and feel of the stop-motion animated Christmas specials of the past with the sharp sensibility of the modern-day classic holiday film. -- (C) NBC</StoryLine>

            <Review>It's new, and even modern, but it has the warm heart and stop-motion style of holiday specials past.</Review>
            <Review>Elf: Buddy's Musical Christmas suits the genre well, and suggests there is an alternative to simply running the sprockets off old holiday perennials.</Review>
            <Review>The story is sweet, and the special is still a good choice for family viewing.</Review>
            <Review>As holiday newcomers go, this is much better than socks and underwear from Grandma. Just don't expect a shiny new train set.</Review>
            <Review>Every little once in a while, a television special reminds us that the Christmas spirit can make the impossible come true. In Elf, for example, the goofiest guy on the planet gets kissed by a beautiful blond. Now that's what I'm talking about.</Review>
            <Review>Clever enough for adults, sweet enough for young kids and musically inventive enough to please the worst Scrooge.</Review>
            <Review>Animated version of much-loved tale invites younger viewers.</Review>
            <Review>It's too much of a rehash of the original, superior Elf and the songs by Matthew Sklar and Chad Beguelin while fine, won't stick with viewers for a minute after the program concludes.</Review>
            <Review>Marrying that source material to the stop-motion components of the original Elf, Buddy's Musical Christmas won't supplant its big-screen inspiration-but it sure is a sight to behold.</Review>

            <Review>...the film sinks its teeth into toxic elements of office culture, such as the trampling of individuality...or simply how no one ever bothers to learn the janitor's name.</Review>
            <Review>"Bloodsucking Bastards" simply isn't worth the time it takes to get rolling.</Review>
            <Review>I'm forgiving of DIY productions that work without much of a bottom line, but there are some basic film techniques that still need to be considered, and don't cost a dime.</Review>
            <Review>"Bloodsucking Bastards" only occasionally matches the inspiration of its jokey title.</Review>
            <Review>For a Friday night rental with some friends and a six-pack (or three), you could do much worse.</Review>
            <Review>Feels a lot more like one long stale viral comedy segment.</Review>
            <Review>A mash-up of Office Space &amp; Fright Night, BB takes some time to get going but when it does, the jokes fly almost as fast as the gore, resulting in a feel-good film that's a wonderful tribute to vampires &amp; raucously deconstructs the modern workplace.</Review>
            <Review>Bloodsucking Bastards is as juvenile as its title suggests, but with a strong script and a stronger cast, it's also a lot of irreverent, gore tinged fun.</Review>
            <Review>[The film] pays off, but it takes a lot of sloppy legwork to get to the good stuff.</Review>
            <Review>Bloodsucking Bastards is the workplace comedy you didn't think you needed, boasting a satirical intelligence that's even sharper than its blood-coated fangs.</Review>
            <Review>Brian James O'Connel's Bloodsucking Bastards is a corporate comedy where the new-hires are also vampires, but remain, for all the occasional big-stake takeovers or explosions of blood, more like metaphors for a certain model of middle management.</Review>
            <Review>While it's not offensively violent, it's full of sexist jokes. And while many viewers will be able to relate to jabs at bottom-feeding companies, they'll probably wonder how such a lackluster script ever became a movie.</Review>

            <Review>The performances, the writing, the direction, Segel's D.F.W. impression, everything is just fine. But The End of the Tour is disgraceful. It feels like it's towing out the real Wallace's ghost to perform some soppy parody of himself.</Review>
            <Review>It's a movie that makes thoughtful drama out of the essential insanity of celebrity journalism, wherein a star proclaims humility while a scribbler promises idolatry.</Review>
            <Review>What we have here is a road trip about two guys talking. And it's riveting.</Review>
            <Review>Despite a premise that seems anything but cinematic, "The End of the Tour" is an offbeat and fascinating film.</Review>
            <Review>The End of the Tour is so effective because it's far too smart to engage in ominous foreshadowing.</Review>
            <Review>Taken as a film about two fictional characters, "The End of the Tour" is a stimulating delight. But it's awfully hard to call it a true honor to its subject's memory.</Review>
            <Review>I can't speak to its veracity, but I loved Segel's work here, playing Wallace as someone who over-analyzed everything, to a compulsive, near paralyzing degree, while still managing to be the most interesting, literary guy in the room.</Review>
            <Review>By the time we're at the end of 'The End of the Tour,' it's arrived at something thoughtful and true about being a writer-and, even better, about being a real person.</Review>
            <Review>Strong performances from the lead actors anchor the film, but the world depicted is rather too hermetic for anyone not immediately interested in the subject matter.</Review>
            <Review>The beautifully shot film is endearing and relatable, director James Ponsoldt (The Spectacular Now) has definitely delivered something that is really special.</Review>
            <Review>It improbably glides along, a conversation of a film, two guys trusting each other or not.</Review>
            <Review>Segel sells the performance by not overselling it, comfortably meeting viewers halfway between imitation and obfuscation.</Review>

            <Review>This doc about the 10-night series, directed by Robert Gordon and Morgan Neville (who won an Oscar last year for Twenty Feet From Stardom), provides an entertaining and, ultimately, depressing peek into TV at a pivotal moment.</Review>

            <Review>Did anyone win? Most say Vidal, since Buckley descended to physical threats. But really, has anyone won in any of this endless bickering?</Review>
            <Review>There is something about the siren call of the TV camera that can turn even big thinkers into brawlers. It was true then and it's true now, and "Best of Enemies" serves as a thoroughly enjoyable reminder.</Review>
            <Review>For better or for worse, we'll never again see television quite like that documented in the compelling "Best of Enemies" ...</Review>
            <Review>Like its two subjects, "Best of Enemies" is lively and smart. Unlike them, it's even-handed.</Review>
            <Review>Anyone interested in political debate and the state of modern television will find Best of Enemies most engrossing.</Review>
            <Review>Its goal is primarily to entertain its audience by presenting a chewy compendium of the snittiest sound bites.</Review>
            <Review>Almost obscenely entertaining.</Review>
            <Review>If even these two witty, well-educated, well-mannered men of letters couldn't keep their on-air interactions from degenerating into cheap shots and name-calling, who could?</Review>
            <Review>As Christopher Hitchens puts it, "There's nothing feigned about their mutual animosity. They really do despise each other."</Review>
            <Review>Simultaneously documenting the on-and-off air sparring matches for audiences too young to remember them, but also chart their place in the history of modern political discourse make this a nourishing and entertaining documentary.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>The movie has been dedicated to Paul Mazursky, the great radiologist of American social interplay who died last year. But Swanberg is still murmuring where Mazursky could speechify, gesticulate, and shout, sometimes in the same sequence.</Review>
            <Review>Conversations drift and weave, as do the people having them. Narcissistic melancholy dukes it out with beer-and-pot-stoked merriment. There is longing. There is foolhardiness.</Review>
            <Review>While you're watching it, "Digging for Fire" may feel slight or tentative, but its cumulative impact is entrancing. Few films about a marital rift make so much of what seems so little.</Review>
            <Review>While it has its charms, Swanberg is tilling soil here that has been churned since humanity began, and he doesn't come up with very much that's new.</Review>
            <Review>"Digging for Fire" is a pleasant escape - an attractively shot, gracefully edited and, finally, emotionally satisfying mystery about the nature of marriage itself.</Review>
            <Review>Unfortunately, for as much dialogue as "Digging for Fire" has, the film doesn't go into much depth about Tim and Lee's true feelings about marriage and their lives.</Review>
            <Review>The size of that ensemble and Swanberg's particular way of sorta hazily drifting from one half-overheard conversation to the next gives the picture a Robert Altman vibe that's never really been present in his work before.</Review>
            <Review>Strong performances drive thoughtful, mature marital drama.</Review>
            <Review>May not say anything revelatory, but the realization it imparts is no less valuable for it.</Review>
            <Review>The looseness turns into haphazardness, and while the picture digs around a lot, it never really catches fire.</Review>
            <Review>It's a killer when 90 percent of your film consists of dozens of actors spouting reams of improvised dialogue that quickly fades into a din.</Review>
            <Review>The large, talented cast is clearly thriving in the freewheeling style.</Review>

            <Review>As horror comedies go, this one sadly winds up somewhere between Scary Movie 4 and 5.</Review>
            <Review>"The Final Girls" is never once scary, the effects are schlocky, and the action/fight scenes are confusing, especially one that takes place in a dark shack where it is impossible to tell what is happening.</Review>
            <Review>The Final Girls is all smiles and winks, but lacks the blood to make its horror satire pulse.</Review>
            <Review>A playful deconstruction of the slasher film that ultimately packs a surprisingly affecting punch.</Review>
            <Review>A horror comedy that proves that with the right actors you can make an amusing movie even if a lot of your ideas are borrowed.</Review>
            <Review>The gender commentary is still on point, and The Final Girls successfully disembowels its target trope. But it works better as film criticism than it does as a film.</Review>
            <Review>Beneath the horror-comedy hijinks lies a beating heart.</Review>
            <Review>Cut-rate CGI, shaky performances, and a frequently unintelligible screenplay sink the ship.</Review>
            <Review>It hopes to riff off the classic era of slasher films, but unfortunately The Final Girls only ends up adding to the clichés.</Review>
            <Review>Missteps aside, with the vivid imagery around the campgrounds and the slick sense of humor, Strauss-Schulson nails certain aspects.</Review>
            <Review>Hiding beneath the veneer of a slasher horror comedy beats a touching and heartbreaking dramedy about letting go, and accepting that sometimes nature has to take its course.</Review>
            <Review>A very well balanced film, jumping between the dramatic and comedic with much easy in a very good and entertaining way. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>

            <Review>There's plenty of gooey insectivorous f/x, yet despite game contributions from all involved, nothing else in "Stung" goes quite far enough.</Review>
            <Review>"Stung" is the worst kind of neo-exploitation film: the kind that encourages you to root for a good guy who is essentially a man-child until crisis mode kicks in, and he abruptly becomes Badass Grownupmin.</Review>
            <Review>Unfortunately, the human relationships depicted here are less credible than the solid special effects.</Review>
            <Review>The headliners, of course, are the monsters, and Mr. Diez, a former effects specialist, skillfully blends viscous textures with cheesy digital flourishes.</Review>
            <Review>In the movie's final stretch, nearly every scene feels drawn out to twice its natural length-and not as an exercise in unbearable tension.</Review>
            <Review>It delights in its own stupidity the way a dog rolls in dirt, but is nearly as difficult to get mad at after it muddies up the rug.</Review>
            <Review>Part old-school critter camp, part new-school mentality, Stung features some incredible special effects, tons of wickedly fun kills, as well as a strong script from Adam Aresty that does an excellent job balancing out the humor and horror.</Review>
            <Review>Boasts a lively level of showmanship which carries it through its rather predictable narrative course.</Review>
            <Review>The two leads keep things ticking over more through their own charisma than anything in the perfunctory script - and the low-grade CGI makes the wasps look like a swarm of hyperactive pixels.</Review>
            <Review>Delivers a generous dose of bee movie madness.</Review>
            <Review>It's a creature feature calibrated to satisfy much simpler, old-fashioned pleasures.</Review>
            <Review>Director Benni Diez tries for schlock shocks in this giant-bug flick. Sadly, what's left out here is the fun.</Review>

            <Review>A surprisingly lovely little film.</Review>
            <Review>An infectiously spirited and pleasingly celebratory documentary about the globe-spanning appeal of American-style tap dance.</Review>
            <Review>It would be better if it had a bit less proclaiming and a bit more nuts-and-bolts information, but still, it's refreshing to see people bubbling over with enthusiasm for an art that is somewhat out of the mainstream.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is at its best when Hargrove shows rather than tells. Anyone can appreciate these artists in motion, all of whom prove the infectious appeal of a dance that doesn't just respond to rhythm but creates its own.</Review>
            <Review>Director Dean Hargrove's claim to fame was inventing "Matlock." After sitting through "Tap World," I can assure you it still is.</Review>
            <Review>It's rare to find a film that portrays dancers of all shapes, colors, ages, and sizes as beautiful, which they are.</Review>

            <Review>"The Diabolical" is a tepid horror-thriller that never manages to sell, much less clarify, its potentially ambitious concept.</Review>
            <Review>None of the elements-the scary stuff, the psychological drama, the family-dynamic crises-really deliver the wallop necessary to provide truly memorable horror fare.</Review>
            <Review>Although the plot becomes needlessly busy, Legrand fails to generate palpable terror and the ending feels rather rushed.</Review>
            <Review>Nothing out of the ordinary, but it'll keep anyone planning a Halloween all-nighter awake and interested.</Review>
            <Review>A sharp little genre mix-it-up that delivers one hell of thoroughly set-up sucker punch without ever undermining its spiffy sci-fi/spook-show hijinks.</Review>
            <Review>Half-decent effects, some seriously misguided mothering (by Ali Larter) and a third act twist don't add up to enough to bother with this one.</Review>
            <Review>a rich and intriguing variation on a timeworn theme, as the tropes of the haunted house flick are ingeniously reverse-engineered and rebuilt into something else.</Review>

            <Review>The actors do their best with a hit-and-miss screenplay.</Review>
            <Review>The giggly men's-magazine tone, especially in Bogdanovich's treatment of call girls, makes the movie seem weirdly anachronistic.</Review>
            <Review>The whole movie is tantrums and meltdowns and pitiful nostalgia... And yet every once in a while, something funny will happen.</Review>
            <Review>She's Funny That Way often displays an old-school generosity and polish, and at least one breakout performance - but just as often, its moments of inspiration are tempered by miscasting and shrill attempts at humor.</Review>
            <Review>Too many times the characters in this movie sprint across the line separating quirky charm from know-somethingish affectation, and then stay on the wrong side of it.</Review>
            <Review>So hopelessly nostalgic about the madcap fizz and fury of screwball pictures, it never works up a head of steam as a funny, in-this-moment comedy on its own.</Review>
            <Review>Bogdanovich, the principal proponent of the latter-day screwball comedy, wastes a large and capable cast here.</Review>
            <Review>It's a lighthearted, somewhat amusing romp written by Bogdanovich and his ex-wife Louise Stratten, filled with interweaving stories that twist and turn, and are amplified when it becomes clear this isn't the first time Arnold has "mentored" a prostitute.</Review>
            <Review>Co-written by Bogdanovich with his ex-wife Louise Stratten ... the story is brisk, breezy and executed with panache.</Review>
            <Review>Thankfully, with some top-notch performances, including Ifans' lusty leading man and Jennifer Aniston as a cynical counsellor, this movie turns out to actually be funny that way.</Review>
            <Review>Amusing piffle for audiences congenitally annoyed by new-fangled comedies.</Review>
            <Review>She's Funny That Way is an oddity that feels like a crowd pleaser but ultimately plays to a very small room.</Review>

            <Review>Funny, warm and not afraid to include gags clearly intended more for parents than their kids, it's the kind of production that keeps the franchise fresh (and crassly, merchandise flying off shelves) while waiting for yet another sequel.</Review>
            <Review>The spirit remains true, and this is a nice add-on to the movies, with the familiar subtext that the cool effects in video games are no substitute for a kid's own imagination.</Review>
            <Review>Quite frankly, it makes you realize that the "Toy Story" series could easily continue, uninterrupted, to infinity and beyond.</Review>
            <Review>Writer/director Steve Purcell brings these new toys to life with small details that ring true to life, from the herky-jerky movement of a dinosaur playset's elevator to a brief, TV commercial-length theme song for these battling dinos.</Review>
            <Review>It basically contains the emotional capacity of a six-minute Toy Story short so don't expect a tear-filled, transcended experience. But do expect a playful, amusing addition to the growing saga that both kids and grownups will enjoy.</Review>
            <Review>An instant delight that is sure to be a favorite perennial for years to come.</Review>
            <Review>It's still fun, still sweet, and still a pleasure to hear Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Wallace Shawn and the gang voice these characters, but I checked my watch several times and would have probably preferred it at something closer to Toy Story Toons length.</Review>
            <Review>Delightful franchise add-on has happy messages, some peril.</Review>
            <Review>Delivering humor, heart and a toy-filled adventure, Toy Story that Time Forgot is another wonderful, entertaining and playful installment to the Toy Story franchise.</Review>

        <Title>Matt Shepard is a Friend of Mine</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2015</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>89</Duration>
        <StoryLine>On October 7, 1998, University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard was brutally beaten, tied to a fence and left to die because he was gay. Years later, Michele Josue, a close friend of Matt's, revisits the shocking case with never-before-seen photos, rare video footage, as Matt's all-too-brief life is remembered through the vivid testimonies of those whose lives he touched, from the friends and family who knew him best to the bartender who saw him on the night of the attack. New revelations emerge in one of the most notorious hate crimes in US history, leading to a searing, poignant, and multi-layered biographical and sociological portrait. In the end, the notion of forgiveness--embodied in the moving and courageous final act of Matt's parents--takes on truly heroic proportions. (C) Run Rabbit Run Media</StoryLine>

            <Review>The main thing writer-director Michele Jouse wanted to do was to give a voice to those who are still mourning Shepard and allow them to share their stories. Through them, we get to know the person behind the tragedy.</Review>
            <Review>This is a film that attempts to portray Shepard as an ordinary young man who happened to become a lightning-rod figure. But most of all, it gives its characters - and its audience - a chance to reflect.</Review>
            <Review>If the director wanted to rehumanize Shepard, she has succeeded. Her other goal, though worthwhile, was not so easy to accomplish: to make sense of a horrific event and move on.</Review>
            <Review>Josue's film is not consistently effective in bridging her personal story with Shepard's well-known legacy, but there are striking moments that explore the limits of forgiveness.</Review>
            <Review>Filmmaker Michele Josue, who knew Matthew, does a fine job of reconstructing the crime and the reaction it provoked across the U.S. and beyond.</Review>
            <Review>The film is enough to prompt soul-searching among parents, educators and the LGBT community on how to provide adequate guidance and support for LGBT youths.</Review>
            <Review>There's nothing new here in terms of documentary form, and there are too many filler scenes shot from inside cars driving down Wyoming's highways. But this is an important, emotionally powerful story.</Review>
            <Review>Director Michele Josue depicts the personal side the famous victim of hate she knew as friend.</Review>
            <Review>Moving documentary brings hate crime victim to life.</Review>
            <Review>An almost unbearably heartbreaking documentary rehumanizes the LGBT icon... and makes him newly tragic all over again.</Review>
            <Review>Josue's film (her first) is a work of raw, unfiltered emotion.</Review>
            <Review>Long-in-coming doc offers an intensely personal look behind the headlines.</Review>

            <Review>Inside Out [is] a bold, gorgeous, sweet, funny, sometimes heartbreakingly sad, candy-colored adventure that deserves an Academy Award nomination for best picture.</Review>
            <Review>This is a movie that dares to explore existential crises, in the middle of the summer, in an animated movie that's aimed at the whole family</Review>
            <Review>On the scale of inventiveness, "Inside Out" will be hard to top this year. As so often with Pixar, you feel that you are visiting a laboratory crossed with a rainbow.</Review>
            <Review>Welcome back, Pixar. You were sorely missed.</Review>
            <Review>The challenge here involves maintaining a believable humanity while also making an entertaining case that humanity is impossible without the proper emotional configuration. And in meeting that challenge, the movie keeps surprising and delighting you.</Review>
            <Review>It's all very Freudian, or Jungian, or whatever, and little kids may get lost, but there's real verve in the animation and wit in the byplay.</Review>

            <Review>"Inside Out" does what Pixar does best: It stimulates adult minds stiffened with age and alerts them to the brilliant possibilities of everyday life.</Review>
            <Review>Inside Out, which is co-directed by Pete Docter and Ronaldo Del Carmen, may be [Pixar's] most inventive film yet.</Review>
            <Review>Cartoon epistemology 101. Kids learn sadness is valid, and joy becomes sad too (bitter-sweetness). It's all good. 'Inside Out' is endearing, inventive, sensitive, and funny.</Review>
            <Review>Pixar has gone back to what it does best: Making characters you care about and want to stay with, who feel and act the way real people do.</Review>

            <Review>In the end, the formalism of "Stations of the Cross" wouldn't work at all without the work of van Acken, a very talented young lady who's not only in every scene, she's often all there is to every scene.</Review>
            <Review>An austere, beautifully filmed and powerfully acted portrait of extreme religious fervor that slyly flirts with comedy.</Review>
            <Review>There's a purity, cinematic if not spiritual, to the way Brüggemann carefully composes each static shot, as though they all really were paintings to be arranged in succession along a line of pews.</Review>
            <Review>There's more than a sneaking suspicion that the rush to preach against religious excess -- a worthy pursuit -- has merely resulted in another form of sanctimonious sermonizing.</Review>
            <Review>Newcomer Van Acken is a phenomenal find and she's never less than believably torn between doing the right thing and being her own person.</Review>
            <Review>The ending's a touch too cute, but the best scenes here stand as potent, empathetic, well-observed broadsides against fundamentalism.</Review>
            <Review>Stations of the Cross belongs among the decade's best films about the lengths one must go to in order to balance strong beliefs with a tolerance toward a secular world that fights against those beliefs.</Review>
            <Review>While the film's craftsmanship and experimental form go some way toward mitigating the convenient plotting and confused point of view, wrapping the whole in craw-sticking sanctimony is a sin too far for forgiveness.</Review>
            <Review>A spiritual movie for practicing empathy and compassion for fearful fundamentalists.</Review>
            <Review>It understands that fitting in, for many contemporary youth, means standing out by attaching oneself to ideological tenets.</Review>
            <Review>Dietrich Brüggemann's disturbing drama premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival and is divided into 14 parts, often pale, minimalist tableaux, for the 14 Stations of the Cross.</Review>
            <Review>Stations of the Cross appears to acknowledge the miraculous, even as it descends into hell on Earth.</Review>

            <Review>While this kind of tale is a fantasy for the movies, with an emphasis on realism in style and deliberately paced story, "Before We Go" suggests that it really can happen, even just for a fleeting moment.</Review>
            <Review>Slight and familiar but sweet enough for Saturday night, Before We Go is the umpteenth re-up of Brief Encounter, not that there's anything wrong with that.</Review>
            <Review>Very little here is special, despite the individual charms of Evans and co-star Alice Eve.</Review>
            <Review>The whole effort seems to run solely on the smiles of its photogenic leads. And, frankly, the smiles routinely dissipate any perceived tension.</Review>
            <Review>Before We Go is a nice enough effort, a little movie with a big heart.</Review>
            <Review>A modest, briskly paced actors' movie.</Review>
            <Review>Evans and Eve as actors get a passing grade, but Evans as director fails to find a thematic centre worth sticking around to watch.</Review>
            <Review>The storyline is so bland it wouldn't even pass master for a daytime soap, and the strangely off-kilter depiction of New York doesn't help.</Review>
            <Review>Despite the charismatic nature of both the leads, Before We Go is a light affair that never really does more than scratch the surface of their characters.</Review>
            <Review>Charming actors can't save tepid relationship drama.</Review>
            <Review>The movies borrows from so many other films that it fails to find its own voice. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>The film is very much what you would expect from a movie directed by Captain America. It's old-fashioned, a little corny, and almost impossible to resist.</Review>

            <Review>The great joy of the film, whether you know piano or not, is watching Bernstein teach.</Review>
            <Review>Hawke's cinematic etude may not unlock all the mysteries of music, but "Seymour: An Introduction" is universal enough to be understood by a bananafish.</Review>
            <Review>Like a touching master class on living correctly, listening to the charming Bernstein will have you changing keys.</Review>
            <Review>Coming off of his superb one-two performances for Richard Linklater in Before Midnight and Boyhood, Hawke continues to work at a creative high level. He demonstrates a rapport and openness with his subject that proves exceptionally affecting.</Review>
            <Review>Whether or not Hawke got any answers to his questions about the purpose of being artist, seeking them under the guidance of a teacher like Bernstein resulted in this work of art.</Review>
            <Review>Seymour: An Introduction is just that - not too much biography, or history. And one needn't be a music aficionado, or a musician, to appreciate the modest erudition coming from this man.</Review>
            <Review>Seymour is intriguing, mainly because it brings together two uniquely talented artists -- Hawke and Bernstein -- and captures them in thought and ocasionally in conversation, sometimes together but more often on their own.</Review>
            <Review>Not only a very fine documentary, but a warm and likable one to boot.</Review>
            <Review>There's no pressing story to tell, or even especially vital achievement to record, so the film probably counts as bit of self-indulgence from Hawke, but it's got a very good heart.</Review>
            <Review>More crucial to [the film] than Bernstein's personality, endearing as it is, is the music he plays.</Review>
            <Review>It's quiet, considered and spellbinding, with a great deal of beautiful music - some of it performed exquisitely by Bernstein himself.</Review>
            <Review>Bernstein seems like a man who has found fulfillment in his life, and his students seem fulfilled as well. His story is compelling and his words seem to be loaded with wisdom. He is a fascinating character.</Review>

            <Review>What begins as a first-person account of one man's quest to change the way he speaks soon becomes something closer to pop anthropology, in the process throwing in a bit of sociolinguistics and stand-up comedy.</Review>
            <Review>The tone is light and hopeful throughout, while allowing for the possibility of more searching investigation on the viewer's part.</Review>
            <Review>A cheerful, highly personal investigation into queer cultural identity ...</Review>
            <Review>The breezy and humorous tone doesn't disguise the fact that Thorpe's film is both intimate and quietly courageous.</Review>
            <Review>A peppy but profound documentary exploration of self-projection and self-image.</Review>
            <Review>Do I Sound Gay? humorously tackles the thus-far unaired and touchy question of whether certain intonations and speech patterns mark out some gay men the second they say hello.</Review>

        <Duration>80</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Every year at Christmas time it seems the baby in the manger takes more and more of a backseat to retail sales, Santa Claus, and political correctness. With "Merry Christmas" being replaced by "Seasons Greetings" and court ordered removal of public nativity scenes, the fruit of Mary's womb is falling on hard times. But this year, Kirk Cameron is taking back Christmas with his engaging new movie KIRK CAMERON'S SAVING CHRISTMAS. Opening in select theaters November 14, the newest movie from the star of Fireproof and Unstoppable is filled with laughter, warmth, and God-honoring cheer! KIRK CAMERON'S SAVING CHRISTMAS will change the way your family sees and celebrates this magical time of year. In KIRK CAMERON'S SAVING CHRISTMAS, Kirk's sister's annual Christmas party is about to be ruined by Kirk's brother-in-law Christian, who is chock full of no-fun Scroogery. Kirk realizes it's his job to grab Christian by his seasonal sweater and show him Christ where Christ has always been: smack dab at the center of all the Christmas hoopla. KIRK CAMERON'S SAVING CHRISTMAS provides a biblical basis for our favorite time-honored traditions and celebrations, and the inspiration to stand strongly against a culture that wants to trivialize and eliminate the faith elements of this holy season. This Christmas, have your family join with Kirk Cameron's family and dive headfirst into all the joy, dancing, celebration, feasting, imagination, and traditions that glorify the true "reason for the season." Take in the splendor; take in the majesty; take in the story. Take it all in ... and then take back Christmas!I (C) IDP/Samuel Goldwyn</StoryLine>

            <Review>Had "Saving Christmas" run any longer, Cameron would no doubt have found a way to find the divinity in Frosty, Rudolph, the Grinch, peppermint bark, the Elf on the Shelf, frosted cranberry hand soap and Mr. Hanky the Christmas Poo.</Review>

        <Duration>107</Duration>
        <StoryLine>(February 12, 2015) When seminal documentary filmmaker Ed Pincus (Black Natchez, Diaries (1971-1976), The Axe in the Attic), considered the father of first-person nonfiction film, is diagnosed with a terminal illness, he and his collaborator Lucia Small (My Father, The Genius, The Axe in the Attic) team up to make one last film. One Cut, One Life is an intense, frank, and sometimes humorous exploration of the human condition that invites the viewer to contemplate what is important, not only at the end of life, but through all phases of live and creative pursuits.

            <Review>The film is an exploration of art as a way through immense and complex emotions.</Review>
            <Review>As exasperating as it is weirdly compelling.</Review>
            <Review>It's a thing of lovely imperfections: profound and banal, self-absorbed and insightful, weighted with grief and buoyed by resilience. In short, as messy and precious as life itself.</Review>
            <Review>This extremely personal and moving documentary has several layers.</Review>
            <Review>As intuitive as its structure, as natural as the processes of dying and mourning that make up its core.</Review>
            <Review>A bittersweet testimony to documentary filmmaking, collaboration and camaraderie</Review>
            <Review>The longer the movie goes on, the more interesting it gets.</Review>
            <Review>Who 'owns' a death? And what is owed to the dying, whether their exit is sudden or a slow and managed one? Those heavy questions hang over this engaging doc, which grapples with loss, love and the boundaries of intimacy.</Review>
            <Review>Through their self-reflective exploration, Ed [Pincus] and Lucia [Small] point their lens at the tough questions examining death, loss, fate and art's relationship to privacy.</Review>
            <Review>The doc emerges not so much as a glimpse into the mind of a dying artist than as a factual drama on how loved ones are impacted by an individual's death.</Review>
            <Review>Unfortunately Lucia Small has bitten off more than she can chew ... It is not my job to tell her what film she should have made. But it is my job to tell my readers that the film Lucia Small has made is diffuse, disorganized, and just too 'fuzzy' for me.</Review>

            <Review>There are scenes in the surreally lazy, occasionally funny Pixels in which Sandler's face slips into the exact same weary, disgruntled expression he wears in Funny People.</Review>
            <Review>Pixels is devoid of cynicism and it has a cheerfully cheesy vibe, and it's the kind of movie you'll forget about a week after seeing it.</Review>
            <Review>Nostalgia is a wonder and a cheat. The right touchstone can make the most discerning movie-goer forgive a film as lazy as Pixels. Almost.</Review>
            <Review>Welcome to the End of the World, Adam Sandler-style.</Review>
            <Review>This is a film in which a viewer can be forgiven for rooting for the old video game icons to annihilate humanity. God help us if the best savior we can muster is Sandler.</Review>
            <Review>This is just a lot of chomp-chomp-chomp and point tallies wafting upward whenever something game-oriented is blown up.</Review>
            <Review>The movie defines "safe", covering all the family-friendly bases with the sincerity of a Las Vegas casino lounge act.</Review>
            <Review>Not as bad as advance word - the words being "Adam Sandler movie" - would suggest. Still ...</Review>
            <Review>Bad movie "Pixels" is just the latest pock mark on Adam Sandler's still downtrending career, only noteworthy in its unprecedented slothfulness.</Review>
            <Review>The idea and the potential is there, however, with Hollywood's favourite man-child there to show us the way - yes, we're looking at you Mr. Sandler - you can't help but feel that this could have been something great, had it landed in someone else's lap.</Review>
            <Review>Pixels feels like a wasted opportunity. Kids today won't care, while big kids will just despair.</Review>
            <Review>It's a neat idea for a parody disaster film but it's wholly lost in this melange of underwritten characters and awful dialogue.</Review>

            <Review>The modicum of pleasure delivered by "Southpaw" arrives thanks to its cast, who struggle bravely and energetically with the hopelessly bland text and the invisible, impersonal direction.</Review>
            <Review>Southpaw isn't content with presenting a gallery of clichéd characters. It takes the time to put flesh on the bones.</Review>
            <Review>I veered between being awed and appalled, though mostly the latter.</Review>
            <Review>"Southpaw" is a tremendous accomplishment of mainstream cinematic craft, a near-perfect match of director, material and star.</Review>
            <Review>When you look past Fuqua's jittery directing, which dices up shots and leans the camera close into its star's painstakingly battered mug, Southpaw is a melange of familiar fighter movie ideas and images going back to Rocky.</Review>
            <Review>Just as director Antoine Fuqua starts to close in on something interesting and unexpected, he retreats to the safety of his corner and gives us what we've seen too many times before: a predictable flurry of melodramatic jabs.</Review>
            <Review>Can be too conventional at times because of its calculated and cliche script but the director compensates it with a dynamic staging. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Dull tale of boxing and redemption provides actors showcase.</Review>
            <Review>It's an unsurprising portrayal of an obvious part, but at least [Gyllenhaal] executes it terribly well, something that cannot be said for the remainder of an equally unsurprising, obvious motion picture.</Review>
            <Review>About as subtle as a right uppercut to the jaw, Southpaw is nonetheless a welcome addition to the boxing melodrama genre.</Review>
            <Review>Southpaw may not bring anything new to the table but there's a nostalgic comfort in watching Billy -- a hardened stereotypical male who is willing to risk disastrous injury for love and glory both in and outside the ring.</Review>
            <Review>Gyllenhaal is terrific. It's just a pity that for all of his gym work, he's in a movie that's testing positive for melodramatic steroids.</Review>

            <Review>Like Godard's "Breathless" and Wong's "As Tears Go By," "Rebels" cunningly synthesizes both B-movie and art film.</Review>
            <Review>A breathtaking, disturbing look at urban angst and the emptiness of youth culture ...</Review>
            <Review>It seems so fresh and immediate you'd never know that it's 23 years old.</Review>
            <Review>A clinical, cool-suspicious dissection of disaffected youth maneuvering Taipei's grimier, noisier corners.</Review>
            <Review>[Rebels of the Neon God] is the director's most accessible film. That will seem like a funny observation once you've seen it, because Tsai's most accessible film is more unusual and uncompromising than any you're likely to see this year.</Review>
            <Review>Not to suggest that cigarette smoking or petty crime is cool, but is it possible to have a cooler entrance than that of Ah Tze and Ah Bing, first seen robbing a blue-lit phone booth on a rainy night in Taipei, cigarettes dangling from their lips?</Review>
            <Review>More than just watching an early film by an untouchable master; it allows you to see his style with newly fresh eyes.</Review>
            <Review>For fans of arthouse cinema, it's easily the most interesting thing to come along in some time.</Review>
            <Review>One of the great films about modern unrest and the pangs of youth. I can't wait to watch it again.</Review>
            <Review>Rebels of the Neon God still brims with the panache of someone still figuring himself out...</Review>
            <Review>Journeying through the grittier side of Taipei -- through musty love hotels, tenements, and street markets -- the film revels in the unabashedly grime-filled beauty of the city and basks itself in melancholy.</Review>

            <Review>Max is an absurdly violent PG-rated movie in which kids and dogs are repeatedly in peril.</Review>
            <Review>Yakin doesn't condescend to his audience, and infuses his plot with a surprisingly ambitious and revealing commentary about the experience of war.</Review>
            <Review>It's like they invited the Coen brothers - or maybe Quentin Tarantino - to script a few scenes of a "Dora the Explorer" episode.</Review>
            <Review>Yakin executes the touching material with the expected serviceability.</Review>
            <Review>Lassie and her child companions often got into some dicey scrapes, but as much as I can recall, they usually didn't result in much of a body count.</Review>
            <Review>How a sweet story about a boy and his dog turns into a lame thriller about backwoods weapons dealing is anyone's guess.</Review>
            <Review>I'm sure a few people will be easily manipulated and distracted by the cute dog. It happens. Otherwise, Max is a waste of your time.</Review>
            <Review>Despite some great performances from both the young Wiggins, Thomas Hayden Church and the impressive and loveable Max, if you're looking for anything other than a minor distraction you're barking up the wrong tree.</Review>
            <Review>Lost in this shuffle of bullets and narrow misses is Yakin's stated goal of telling a story about the great service that military dogs provide... I'm not sure where that film went, but the bizarre, violent mess I saw isn't it.</Review>
            <Review>There are life-and-death moments for both people and animals. But there are also moments of great vividity, of tearing through the woods with a dog at your side and choosing difficult honor over expedient disgrace.</Review>
            <Review>Though littered with sentiment and family movie hokum, this story of a military dog suffering from post-traumatic stress finds the essence of true friendship, prompting uncontrolled saline leaks from the eyeball.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Nicole (Julianne C�te) is adrift after college graduation, working a dead-end summer job in her small Quebec hometown and spending evenings with her best pal, V�ronique. When her older brother Remi unexpectedly returns with his bandmates in tow, disrupting the girls' half-baked summer, it becomes clear to Nicole that something must and will change. Shot in luminous black and white and infused with a sultry melancholy, Tu dors Nicole brilliantly captures that liminal stage where the fading yet familiar attachments of childhood still seem far more appealing, precious, and real than the sterility of the grown-up world.

            <Review>Lafleur's film is a quiet trifle that sneaks up on you, like a pleasant dream you might have and then gradually forget. Its very slightness is its greatest weapon.</Review>
            <Review>Martin is as desperate to grow up as Nicole is reluctant to take the next step. Both are at a crossroads that this wonderful, lighter-than-air movie depicts as a major turning point.</Review>
            <Review>Director Stéphane Lafleur shoots in black and white with a sure and delicate eye.</Review>
            <Review>The night scenes are particularly resonant, mixing humour, suspense and textured visuals. This is the kind of film dream from which you feel reluctant to wake.</Review>
            <Review>Tu Dors Nicole accurately recreates that feeling of youth when the summer seemed like it would last forever. As the French say, it's très drôle.</Review>
            <Review>Mostly, I connected to its gentle melancholy, the sense of a life changing in almost imperceptible ways.</Review>
            <Review>Under the direction of Stéphane Lafleur, this Québécois comedy takes on an air of wondrous restlessness in its minor ambitions.</Review>
            <Review>Nothing happens, but everything thrums.</Review>
            <Review>Will appeal to lovers of "Frances Ha."</Review>
            <Review>Stéphane Lafleur denies Nicole the angsty treatments given similar characters in films like The Graduate and Frances Ha by refusing to saturate the film with an undergirding sense of charm.</Review>
            <Review>Lafleur counters the lackadaisical narrative with direction, editing and sound cues that are playful but precise, mysterious but potent, making every note in this exceptionally well-made film something to savour.</Review>
            <Review>It's hard to explain just why I so adored Tu dors Nicole. Can't you just take my word for it?</Review>
