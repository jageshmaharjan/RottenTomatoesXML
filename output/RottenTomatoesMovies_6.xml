        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>104</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Gritty, grisly, and uncommonly ambitious, The Purge: Anarchy represents a slight improvement over its predecessor, but it's still never as smart or resonant as it tries to be.</StoryLine>

            <Review>For most of the film, returning writer-director James DeMonaco favors gore and shock inserts of music over the edgy, nasty parody for which the material seems ready made.</Review>
            <Review>DeMonaco is more interested in scenarios than in stocking them with human beings. Everybody here is a backstory in a T-shirt.</Review>
            <Review>Grillo's performance will make you wonder why he didn't start headlining movies like this before turning 50; his is the soft-spoken kind of charisma that helped make half of the Expendables into stars back in the '80s and '90s.</Review>
            <Review>The Purge: Anarchy is basically a slasher movie in which society is the deranged killer. It plays like it's already a grindhouse classic - dark, dirty, and disreputable.</Review>
            <Review>"The Purge: Anarchy" is more in line with what people going to a "Purge" movie would want out of a "Purge" movie.</Review>
            <Review>An equally effective, deliciously disturbing movie.</Review>
            <Review>Progressive allegory so stupid it comes across as conservative parody.</Review>
            <Review>An ugly, stupid, pointless debacle that doubles down on the disappointment of its predecessor.</Review>
            <Review>A face [is given] to moral questions posed in The Purge by specifically revolving the plot around today's growing wealth disparity as underground leaders rise to fight back.</Review>
            <Review>A vast improvement and a more well-conceived concept this time around, The Purge: Anarchy is a ridiculous amount of fun and Frank Grillo is truly one of the better cinematic anti-heroes we've seen in some time.</Review>
            <Review>Perhaps it's fitting that the word "anarchy" is in the movie's title: it implies all that is necessary in describing such a disorderly narrative.</Review>
            <Review>Expands the "crime is temporarily legal" concept in all sorts of juicy ways.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>110</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Anne has a very active imagination, only natural for a writer. But in her mid-thirties, she still knows practically nothing of her own family's past. After her mother's death, Anne discovers old photos and letters that convince her to take a closer look at the life of her parents, Michael and L�na. The young couple met in the concentration camps during World War II, later moving to France to start their new life together. Soon, Anne's research into their Jewish history and their ties to Lyon's communist party reveals the existence of a mysterious uncle, Jean, whom everyone seems intent on forgetting entirely. As she gradually closes in on the discovery she didn't know she was looking for, her father grows ever more ill, and may take the secret that kept them apart for so long to his grave. In a journey that stretches from post-war France to the 1980s, Anne's destiny intertwines with her father's past until they form a single, unforgettable story. (c) Film Movement</StoryLine>

            <Review>There's storytelling vigor here and fine performances, plus some pointed exchanges about the burdens of cultural identity and emotional preservation in the aftermath of immense upheaval.</Review>
            <Review>A framing device isn't needed, but the film is compelling overall.</Review>
            <Review>"For A Woman" tells a story that is pretty much fraught with both romantic and political intrigue and it is therefore a little surprising to report that the end result is itself not especially intriguing.</Review>
            <Review>An inviting sense of mystery hangs over the events of 1947, Ms. Kurys's origin story. There are some things, she seems to say, that we never fully understand, including the people we are closest to.</Review>
            <Review>The striking Thierry brings her character to nuanced life on screen, torn between loyalty to the man who saved her and passion for his Nazi-hunting brother.</Review>
            <Review>This is engrossing stuff, not only in the remarkable details of the parents' lives, but in the psychological nuance with which Kurys imagines them.</Review>
            <Review>It pulls you in without ever hinting at where it might take you. And that's a gift.</Review>
            <Review>A historical drama pieced together when two sisters discover things they didn't know about their parents' life in post-World War II France.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>In spite of its insufferably whimsical tendencies - exemplified by its original title, "Oh Boy" - the film may have turned out to be a deeply profound modern postscript about fascism.</Review>
            <Review>Niko's problem is not just that he's spoiled and lazy, but that he's a wimp about it. He only maintains viewer sympathy because everyone else in the film is so obnoxious.</Review>
            <Review>It manages to make an entertaining story out of nothing in particular. And just when you get comfortable passively observing a passive observer, the minutest of twists becomes its own call to action.</Review>
            <Review>The cheerful Dixieland soundtrack implies "A Coffee in Berlin" is a comedy, but the story line smears the screen with melancholy.</Review>
            <Review>As sure of itself visually in its black-and-white evocations of Berlin as its protagonist is unsure of himself and his future.</Review>
            <Review>In Gerster's view, Berlin's unresolved past taints its bustling charm and glossy serenity, as well as every familiar course of practical action-yet his movie veers toward the historical kitsch that he satirizes.</Review>
            <Review>Calm, cool and collected, [it's] a black and white German indie thats as much French New Wave as it is early Richard Linklater.</Review>
            <Review>A charming slacker promenades about Berlin streets.</Review>
            <Review>A slight slacker comedy derivative of American indies but made by a youth-friendly German director of talent.</Review>
            <Review>The film probes deep into the soul of Berlin, asking questions more befitting an old master than a rookie filmmaker.</Review>
            <Review>Lightly likable German indie-flavored romp.</Review>
            <Review>Its low-key, easy pace and refusal to put extra emphasis on anything gives the real emotions more power when they do arrive.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>A sweet, heartfelt, yet never maudlin story about an 11-year-old girl's coming to terms with the loss of her father.</Review>
            <Review>It's difficult to imagine any children's movie retaining the attention of its intended audience for two hours, but this movie feels especially monotonous.</Review>
            <Review>Despite the hand-drawn film's supernatural edge, one of Okiura's lyrical strengths is acquainting a viewer with the poetry of the real - animated reflections of ordinary, beautiful things we see in everyday life without actually noticing them at all.</Review>
            <Review>A sweet tale of a sad girl who moves to a new place and meets supernatural pals.</Review>
            <Review>A striking example of Japanese hand-drawn animation, it casually combines things you wouldn't expect in one place.</Review>
            <Review>Had Okiura cut some of the supernatural shtick he would have had a far more affecting and mercifully shorter movie.</Review>
            <Review>Here, magic-realism and emotional realism run together. The story can lapse into jokiness or drag its heels a little. But when Momo's anguish bursts, and she soon realizes how sad her mother's truly been, the film bursts to life.</Review>
            <Review>This accessible and heartfelt anime charms because of its honesty and impressive attention [to] detail.</Review>
            <Review>The hit-and-miss English dub flattens some of the dramatic beats, but this is still a rather lovely piece of work.</Review>
            <Review>Though made by the studio Production I.G, this is a markedly Ghibli-esque affair, overtly referencing Miyazaki's My Neighbour Totoro and Princess Mononoke among others.</Review>
            <Review>The new anime A Letter to Momo feels like the movie that Hayao Miyazaki's final film should have been.</Review>
            <Review>Filmmakers of live-action fare, even that which ostensibly is aimed at adults, could learn a lot from its tact.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate/>
        <Duration>105</Duration>
        <StoryLine>In this fast-paced, often complex murder mystery, a psychiatrist's patient and later his secretary are killed, yet the police seem unable to come up with any answers so the doc takes matters into his own hands. Roger Moore is Dr. Judd Stevens, a rather meek Chicago psychiatrist whose patient is killed while wearing a jacket borrowed from Stevens. After Stevens' secretary is brutally slain, Lieutenant McGreavy (Rod Steiger) is certain that Stevens is guilty and is ready to prove it, but when his vendetta gets too obvious, he is taken off the case. That leaves his partner Angeli (Elliott Gould), a much more sympathetic cop, to continue on with the investigation. Even then, the killings continue, so Stevens gives up on the police and goes for help to a wacky P.I. (Art Carney) who lives surrounded by clocks and at first seems like a hopeless nitwit. As Stevens continues in his pursuit of the killers, life is complicated by a Mafia bride who seeks his professional help and clues that lead increasingly to the Mafia and cops on the take. The acting may be a bit uneven, and Moore might have fared better if allowed a little Bond action, but the movie is engaging enough to maintain interest throughout.</StoryLine>

Their innocence is shattered, however, when a group of hunters led by the mayor's son brutalizes and rapes the free-spirited girl.

            <Review>Katie Cassidy's intrepid lead performance can't overcome the limitations of a low-budget comicbook adaptation.</Review>
            <Review>It's dull when one wants it to be ludicrous, and serves as a reminder of how hard it is to bring comic books to celluloid life on a limited budget.</Review>
            <Review>Someone should have scribbled a better script for "The Scribbler."</Review>
            <Review>The Scribbler incorporates elements from several genres (science fiction, horror, dark fantasy) and generates some clever disbelief-suspending psychological double-talk.</Review>
            <Review>John Suits creates a brightly colored dystopia that mirrors the palette of superhero comics while the sets themselves resemble the grimy imagery of industrial music videos.</Review>
            <Review>The Scribbler is overwrought, absurd, occasionally exploitative, completely lacking in subplot, takes a good 20-25 minutes to really get going and has acting that varies from excellent to, well, less-than-excellent. It's also hugely fun!</Review>
            <Review>With its endless edginess and unhealthy obsession with madness at its most flamboyant, The Scribbler strains to be a cult film, but even the most diehard lovers of cinema strangeness may find it ultimately too nonsensical and needlessly overwrought.</Review>
            <Review>Not much here, as far as paranoid "Is she nuts?" thrillers go, but just interesting and kinky enough to warrant a look</Review>
            <Review>The film exudes a grunge look and a grunge feel while it shifts gears and genres.</Review>
            <Review>Cassidy owns the film in every bizarre situation, from a sex scene with Dillahunt that needs to be seen to be believed, to interactions with an English bulldog she hears speaking in a thick accent. Don't ask.</Review>
            <Review>Gloriously bonkers! The Scribbler is fearless in its willingness to go right over the edge, which makes it a treat for fans of science-fiction madness.</Review>
            <Review>While The Scribbler isn't exactly in contention with the best that the comic book genre has to offer, Katie Cassidy utilizes the numerous voices in her head to create a unique hero for a bit of stylized freshness.</Review>

            <Review>Don't let this film's faith-based themes keep you from going to see the movie. Even if you ignore the message, the movie stands up simply as a good family-based drama.</Review>
            <Review>Carefully crafted with Evangelicals in mind, this modern parable will certainly resonate with the faith-based demographic as well as secular individuals interested in an entertaining, wholesome family flick with a sobering message.</Review>

            <Review>The mildewed found-footage technique allows some tension to build from offscreen action, but also renders the knockoff John Williams score inexplicable.</Review>
            <Review>You can imagine ET phoning his legal team, but although this kids' sci-fi adventure is derivative, its characters are drawn with more care and insight than you'd expect.</Review>
            <Review>If the movie is a waste, at least it's an instructive one, signaling just how offensive children's entertainment might become in the YouTube era.</Review>
            <Review>Combining some classic plot movements and plenty of modern trappings (just, like, a lot of cell phones), Earth to Echo is a sweet family film that has something for everyone.</Review>
            <Review>Unlike the very successful Spanish horror thriller [Rec] or even the nausea-inducing Cloverfield, which Echo more closely resembles, this film doesn't maintain a consistent point of view or any logic about what's on screen.</Review>
            <Review>With authentic characters, dialogue and settings, Echo's filmmakers have successfully created a story younger kids and pre-teens growing up in a Millennial and post-Millennial culture can relate to.</Review>
            <Review>Whenever Echo is sticking to the kids and their camaraderie, it mostly works as intended.</Review>
            <Review>Clichéd and predictable it may all be, there is no denying the infectious quality of pure optimism.</Review>
            <Review>Sad to say it is not even this generation's 'Short Circuit.' Families deserve much better entertainment at the movie theater, summer or otherwise.</Review>
            <Review>All in all, "Earth to Echo" is passable family entertainment, neither unforgettable nor particularly bad.</Review>
            <Review>It has a good young cast, some occasionally dazzling special effects and a message that even when growing friends grow move apart it's not the end of their own little world.</Review>
            <Review>"Earth to Echo" may have good intentions, but instead it fries its circuits on a misguided narrative and a plot trimmed down to the bare bones.</Review>

            <Review>A brave experiment in stripped-down, visceral filmmaking, writer-director Aaron Wilson's World War II drama "Canopy" is ultimately upended by its minimalist conceit.</Review>
            <Review>While not much is said in the Australian director Aaron Wilson's small-scale first feature, "Canopy," the film conveys volumes about war and humanity.</Review>
            <Review>This is a film that eschews epic battle scenes and carnage to delve into the quieter, no less terrifying, moments of waiting and watching.</Review>
            <Review>To the suddenly white-hot adventure subgenre of one or two souls alone against nature... add the more modestly scaled but no less absorbing wartime survival adventure "Canopy."</Review>
            <Review>Much like his fly-boyflyboy underdog in the opening sequence, Wilson simply can't stick the landing.</Review>
            <Review>Canopy's an exercise in mankind's implicit ability to trust, share, and protect as strength.</Review>
            <Review>Canopy violates nearly every war movie convention, yet it better represents the realities of combat than most of its forerunners.</Review>
            <Review>In many ways, Canopy is closer to a fairy tale than a war film, its soldier like a hero on a perilous, mystical journey through a primordial forest, with a sort of pre-linguistic logic guiding the action.</Review>
            <Review>Canopy is a movie rich of its own world, an 80-minute work of filmmaking that rises above mere war or survival films and becomes something unique.</Review>
            <Review>Canopy is a work of minimal, expressionistic storytelling whose unconventional dramatic beats inject fresh blood in a tired genre.</Review>
            <Review>A humble hybrid between The Thin Red Line and Gravity, Canopy embraces the challenge of making a low-budget World War II film, distilling Australia's involvement in the Pacific Theater into the plight of one unfortunate paratrooper.</Review>
            <Review>"Canopy" begins in stillness, ends in muteness, and in between seldom a word will be uttered. . . . All in all, the screenplay offers up two perfect roles for actors with poor memory recall.</Review>

Mehendra is a chain-wallah, eking out a living fixing zippers on the bustling streets of New Delhi. To ease his financial woes, he sends twelve-year-old Siddharth to work in a distant factory. When the boy doesn't come home for the Diwali holiday, Mehendra and his wife Suman slowly begin to suspect that he was kidnapped by child traffickers. With few resources and no connections, Mehendra desperately travels to Punjab and Mumbai with the hope that whoever took Siddharth might return him unharmed. A powerful family drama both heart-rending and suspenseful, Siddharth won Best Film (and Best Director for Richie Mehta) at the South Asian International Film Festival and is an Official Selection of Human Rights Watch.

            <Review>Simple but engrossing, Canadian director Richie Mehta's Siddharth is the story of an Indian father searching for his missing son, and offers a window into the lives of India's working poor that goes beyond the familiar issues of food and shelter.</Review>
            <Review>Tension builds along with hopelessness but Mehta avoids making judgments or giving easy answers about the circumstances that led to Siddharth being sent off to work.</Review>
            <Review>Though at times "Siddharth" can resemble a well-photographed report on India's social and economic ills, Mehta subtly employs different styles to sustain the poetry, poignancy, and drama.</Review>
            <Review>"Siddharth" provides something more valuable than a tidy resolution: a glimpse of the complicated nature of life a world away.</Review>
            <Review>Like Vittorio De Sica's "The Bicycle Thief," the film uses downbeat themes to make a point about this particular society and life in general.</Review>
            <Review>A spare, lean, and decidedly unsettling account of the ugly reality of child labor and child abduction in India.</Review>
            <Review>It's a striking and polished addition to the catalogue of recent cinema set in India and is a bracing antidote to the spit-shined glibness of Slumdog Millionaire.</Review>
            <Review>The film is made up of details, and these details create characters who are human beings and not just one dimensional victims.</Review>
            <Review>Mehta keeps his sociopolitical critique in the background, allowing it to inform but not interfere with his intimate and devastating story.</Review>
            <Review>Powerful family drama.</Review>
            <Review>By any fair measure, Siddharth is a very good example of world cinema, offering us a window into a world we would not otherwise see. But be cautioned: it is not exactly an "up" film.</Review>
            <Review>By the end, it feels like you're the only one who helped carry Mahendra's horrifying burden in a heavily-populated country.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>126</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Oscar-nominated director Jan Troell, one of Sweden's most acclaimed filmmakers, directs the biopic The Last Sentence. Set against the backdrop of WWII, The Last Sentence is based on the life of crusading journalist Torgny Segerstedt, editor-in-chief of one of Sweden's leading newspapers, highlighting his one-man battle against Nazism and his country's policy of appeasement to Hitler. With Sweden caught between Nazi Germany and Stalin's Russia, the country's elites chose a policy of neutrality and compliance, with few daring to speak up against the evil around them. Among those who did, nobody was as loud and as uncompromising as Segerstedt (Danish star Jesper Christensen, Nymphomaniac: Volume 1, Melancholia), one of the most prominent Swedish journalists of the 20th century. In the eyes of many of his countrymen, his pen was far more dangerous than the Nazi sword. Amidst the political turmoil of the era, Segerstedt's own personal life took a dramatic and scandalous turn as he entered into a very public affair with Maja Forssman, the Jewish wife of his close friend, the newspaper's publisher. Maja Forssman is played by Pernilla August, winner of the Cannes Best Actress Award for Bille August's Best Intentions. (c) Music Box</StoryLine>

            <Review>Unfortunately, Troell chose to shoot the movie in digital black-and-white; the imagery seems anachronistic in its precision, undermining the period decor and clashing with the occasional low-grain newsreel footage of Nazis on the march.</Review>
            <Review>Troell invokes '50's and '60's Swedish cinema: masterly black-and-white cinematography, philosophical angst, a lifeless marriage and loved ones visiting from the afterlife.</Review>
            <Review>It's a thoughtful and workmanlike portrait, but a less than profoundly moving one.</Review>
            <Review>Amazingly, Troell still operates his own camera. "The Last Sentence" was made digitally, and his attention to detail is remarkable.</Review>
            <Review>The great 83-year-old Swedish director Jan Troell specializes in movies about men of great stature in furious conflict with both their countries and themselves.</Review>
            <Review>A more sophisticated work than it appears about a man whose life was more complicated than the world knew.</Review>
            <Review>A decidedly noncommercial film about the courage of a newspaperman who was a real contrast to the inside-the-beltway hacks of today, anxious to justify every war that comes along.</Review>
            <Review>This well-intentioned tale never breaks free from a dry and visually anemic history lesson that could easily be adapted into a monotonous stage play.</Review>
            <Review>With "The Last Sentence," veteran Swedish director Jan Troell serves up a well-mannered biography of a man known for anything but his restraint.</Review>
            <Review>Exposes iconic anti-Nazi Swede's feet of clay-- a tangled personal life. Nuanced character study is a challenge to conventional portraits of heroism and challenging to watch.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately, The Last Sentence, despite the great performances and awesome visuals, gets too preoccupied with its own interpersonal drama and soap opera dynamics, eventually forgetting to address some of the bigger moral implications it hints at.</Review>
            <Review>An unusually balanced, seemingly unbiased biopic. The cast can't be faulted in any way.</Review>

        <StoryLine>A woman discovers some long lost treasure without realizing the danger involved in selling it in this polished, visually striking thriller from the writing and directing team of Julien Carbon and Laurent Courtland. Carrie (Carrie Ng) is a beautiful, mysterious woman living in Hong Kong who has exotic tastes in both pleasure and pain. Carrie is fascinated with the story of the royal executioner to the First Emperor of China, who was said to have developed a special potion that would heighten the senses of his victims while robbing them of their ability to move. Carrie wants to find some of the executioner's special compound, which is believed to be hidden in an ancient white jade objet d'art. As it happens, French sophisticate Catherine (Fr�d�rique Bel) has found the trinket that Carrie is looking for, and she travels to Hong Kong in hopes of selling it. When Carrie learns that Catherine has what she wants, she'll stop at nothing to get it, and the fact Catherine is a beautiful woman makes the game of cat and mouse all the more pleasing for her. Les Nuits Rouges du Bourreau de Jade (aka Red Nights) received its North American premiere at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>From director Uwe Boll's early video game adaptations (House of the Dead, Bloodrayne) to his later, more serious-minded efforts (Darfur, Stoic), filmmaker (and former crewmember on Boll's films) Dan Lee West focuses on finding out just what motivates the notoriously embattled director to continue making films despite the popular and critical backlash that continually threatens to sink his career. In June, 2006, Boll invited the critics who had bashed his film to step into the boxing ring and defend their reviews with their fists. Had Boll's films not been the target of continuous pummeling by both internet critics and professional film reviewers alike, it would have seemed like a desperate PR gimmick. But despite his reputation as a hack, Boll takes filmmaking very seriously, and this was his chance to fight back. It's just one of the many fascinating chapters in the remarkable career of a filmmaker who, much like Ed Wood before him, pours his entire heart and soul into every project he works on, yet somehow manages to retain his infamous status as one of the worst filmmakers in the history of cinema.</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>A feature-length documentary that originally sought to follow the band and their fans throughout the world, to demonstrate how music ties us together when we can't find any other common bond. However, during the filming process in 2012, the story abruptly took a dramatic turn, bringing the band into a Kafkaesque nightmare, when lead singer Randy Blythe was arrested on charges of manslaughter, blamed for the death of one of their young fans in the Czech Republic. What followed was a heart-wrenching courtroom drama that left fans, friends, and curious onlookers around the world on the edge of their seats.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Fort Bliss is a small film, but it addresses big issues, in ways that are never simplistic or dogmatic.</Review>
            <Review>"Fort Bliss" joins "Coming Home" and "The Best Years of Our Lives" as a movie deeply in sync, not just with the military characters it depicts, but also with the civilian world that awaits them with such confoundingly mixed messages.</Review>
            <Review>[A] well-observed and endearing account of one woman grappling with allegiances to her fellow soldiers and her estranged 5-year-old son.</Review>
            <Review>Maggie's agonizing zero-sum struggle to balance a life of military service and a steady relationship with her son feels fresh, raw, and real.</Review>
            <Review>[Myers] is good at capturing the revealing, offhand moments in this story, but Maggie's conflicts about motherhood and the military needed a greater psychological scope than this film provides.</Review>
            <Review>Even when the plotting feels strained or inauthentic, the Asche &amp; Spencer score a mite too insistent, Monaghan's performance rings true.</Review>
            <Review>There aren't a lot of fireworks or surprises in Fort Bliss, but it's a well-told story that pays respect to our men and women in uniform.</Review>
            <Review>Michelle Monaghan elevates an uneven, yet gripping story of a staff sergeant feeling the tug of war in Fort Bliss.</Review>
            <Review>Led by a moving performance from Michelle Monaghan, the film carries heaviness with sensitivity, more interested in the pains of post-service reentry than the usual pressures of a war zone.</Review>
            <Review>The complicated psychological realities of army personnel require a tougher directorial treatment than the maudlin melodrama presented here.</Review>
            <Review>A fairly conventional warrior-home-from-war drama lifted by a totally credible career-making performance by Michelle Monaghan.</Review>
            <Review>Oh, what do I say, folks? I really wanted to like Fort Bliss, but I felt manipulated, like it was a checklist movie that was outside in and not inside out. It had good intentions and good acting; but somehow...</Review>

            <Review>Persecuted squanders the talents of its impressive cast -- including James Remar, Bruce Davison, Fred Dalton Thompson and Dean Stockwell -- with its bizarre premise and inept execution.</Review>
            <Review>A heavy-handed and didactic drama which also manages to be totally mushy in terms of the message it's trying to convey.</Review>
            <Review>Just why one particular TV preacher is so all-fired important isn't clear, and neither is anything else about this overwrought mess.</Review>
            <Review>Straw-man cinema doesn't get much more ludicrous than this heavy-handed, Christian-themed minister-on-the-run thriller.</Review>
            <Review>The Lord works in mysterious ways but "Persecuted" works in blundering, obvious ways, straining a Christianity-under-attack theme through a dopey thriller.</Review>
            <Review>Shouldn't a film about religious tolerance be showing us a man living by example? Instead, we get an image of a bloody, gun-holding hand wrapped in rosary beads. Nice!</Review>
            <Review>Persecuted matches its conservative beliefs to an anachronistic narrative structure and dated cinematic execution.</Review>
            <Review>Woe to the filmmakers of 'Persecuted.'</Review>
            <Review>Lusko's leaden dialogue and heavy-handed symbolism is as unintentionally comical as the miscasting of Fox News host Gretchen Carlson as a journalist.</Review>
            <Review>The movie's entire concept is fatally flawed.</Review>
            <Review>The hero's allies pop up and disappear; killers are on his heels, then they aren't. And that whole business about the Christian evangelical leader whose father is a Catholic priest? Yeah, that doesn't get explained either.</Review>

            <Review>Gebbe elicits strong performances from her actors and succeeds in inspiring a certain sick fascination with the material, yet the film's oppressive unpleasantness yields no new insights into psychology or religious faith.</Review>
            <Review>Pitting good against evil with striking intelligence and a near-operatic commitment to extreme suffering, Ms. Gebbe neither mocks nor celebrates Tore's love for his God.</Review>
            <Review>The film has a lyrical visual palette, almost like a bad memory, and Gebbe draws very strong performances from her cast.</Review>
            <Review>Gebbe appears to be a misanthrope who subjects her male protagonist to senseless cruelty.</Review>
            <Review>Its world is so remote, its characters behavior so unexplained - despite the fact that the film is based on true events - that our connection to the story slackens significantly over time.</Review>
            <Review>A revenge flick where the hero refuses vengeance. We want that catharsis, but if Tore ever stopped turning the other cheek, he'd lose the only thing he has left: forgiveness</Review>
            <Review>It may seem counterintuitive, but at some point the horrors become so heinous that you almost have to believe in God for any of it to make sense.</Review>
            <Review>Nothing Bad Can Happen examines modern faith in a way few films do.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director Katrin Gebbe rubs viewers' faces in this dog dish of a film, with the promise that some sliver of transcendence will redeem it. But it's all dog dish.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately, this is a film that asks deep questions but offers somewhat shallow answers.</Review>

            <Review>Wickedly smart and wickedly playful, Roman Polanski's adaptation of David Ives' Tony-nominated Venus in Fur works on so many levels, it's almost dizzying.</Review>
            <Review>Never underestimate Roman Polanski.</Review>
            <Review>The haunted-house lighting is a perfect match for the claustrophobic intimacy of this two-hander - and camouflage, perhaps, for the fact that "Venus in Fur" remains more play than film.</Review>
            <Review>Whether you like it or not, Roman Polanski is a great artist, and even the minor films of his fugitive decades glimmer with the claustrophobia and sardonic bleakness of his greatest work.</Review>
            <Review>It's tempting to conclude that the entire thing is a rather distasteful joke at the audience's (and the actors') expense.</Review>
            <Review>[Venus in Fur] is the sexiest movie I've seen in a long time.</Review>
            <Review>Perhaps he is more drawn to Mr. Ives's quasi-feminist rationalization of sexual fetish than Sacher-Masoch's explanation of it as mastery over repressed feelings, and somehow sees parallels between the play and his own sexual felony.</Review>
            <Review>Polanski makes an intriguing battle of the sexes out of a filmed play</Review>
            <Review>Desire makes buffoons of us all. Now strike dear mistress, and cure his heart.</Review>
            <Review>It's an actor's pic, and they both come through with grand performances.</Review>

            <Review>As a straight-up, "Law &amp; Order"-esque criminal investigation, it's watchable. But lingering shots and half-baked racial commentary overstate the importance of "Mystery Road."</Review>
            <Review>I won't lie and say Mystery Road kept me on the edge of my seat for its duration, but there is a lot to enjoy in its delicately peeled back layers.</Review>
            <Review>This tightly wound drama evokes a strikingly inventive sense of the Wild West in the Australian Outback.</Review>
            <Review>Sen (who also shoots, scores and edits) goes walkabout through the minefield of contemporary Australian culture, offering an evocative snapshot of an unravelling crime scene - social, racial and economic.</Review>
            <Review>A superior and taut outback adventure, you'd have to go back to Samson and Delilah to find an Australian feature this bonsa.</Review>
            <Review>Slow-burning but very powerful.</Review>
            <Review>Aaron Pendersen is thoroughly believable as the conflicted Jay and the blasted landscape is photographed so well you'll be sweating and swatting the flies away from your own face after 10 mins.</Review>
            <Review>Mystery Road is a detective story that unspools with languid menace on the widescreen of the Australian Outback.</Review>
            <Review>Mystery Road may be set in modern Queensland but it has the feel of a flinty, slow-burning western as one stetson-wearing lawman stands against an entire community.</Review>
            <Review>Director Ivan Sen's fourth feature evokes old westerns, Polanski's Chinatown and other noir classics, but still feels grounded in the dust and dried blood of the Australian soil.</Review>
            <Review>This sand-blasted Aussie murder mystery tinkers with genre convention while managing to remain sincere and thrilling.</Review>
            <Review>A striking and menacing slow-burn thriller set in the Australian outback which blends dry humour with startling social commentary.</Review>

            <Review>Viewers coming to this film without having seen the others would have no problem following the action; whether they'd care about it is another question.</Review>
            <Review>A hectic, convoluted French comedy about a Parisian novelist and the three women in his life.</Review>
            <Review>An amiably daffy look at perpetual adolescence, French-style.</Review>
            <Review>Once the story picks up, it's easy, breezy and enjoyable. It seduces you into thinking: Wouldn't it be fun to reconnect with Xavier in another five years or so?</Review>
            <Review>The film flits from one subplot to another and not in that delightfully freewheeling European kind of way.</Review>
            <Review>It's all very busy, and cute, and, um, French ...</Review>
            <Review>Smart, insightful and full of lively, authentic New York City atmosphere that could never be faked on a sound stage in Atlanta, Chinese Puzzle is the real deal.</Review>
            <Review>Those familiar with the first two films will find the most rewards in this bittersweet concluding chapter.</Review>
            <Review>French filmmaker Cedric Klapisch keeps the tone light and the serious themes just under the surface as he revisits the lively characters from The Spanish Apartment (2002) and Russian Dolls (2005).</Review>
            <Review>Sweet.</Review>
            <Review>The farcical episodes have a fizzy zest, and Klapisch delivers so many stylish and quirky touches throughout that it's easy to overlook his film's flaws.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>It is especially impressive that Days of Future Past is a success; a film this gooey and complex, with such business-minded scope, should not feel like a real movie at all.</Review>
            <Review>Much of this takes place in the early 1970s, which gives the filmmakers an excuse to haul out lots of vintage kitsch and make some rather tasteless references to the Vietnam war.</Review>
            <Review>The results are both dazzling and intimate, clever and - during one tour-de-force sequence - spectacularly funny.</Review>
            <Review>I would be remiss not to note that tucked away amid all the existential melodrama is perhaps the most hilarious set piece ever to grace a superhero film.</Review>
            <Review>Quicksilver ... is the coolest of this picture's new guys, zipping around so fast ... that he can taste soup, rearrange guards' limbs, and nudge bullets off their trajectories all in the time it takes to blink.</Review>
            <Review>The plot is about a fearful society whose expansion of its security apparatus has unintended consequences, but Singer doesn't even touch the story's topical resonances... There's also no real moral quandary to be grappled with.</Review>
            <Review>X-Men: Days of Future Past is, on its own, a fine film, funny in all the right places, impressively acted, and rousing in its action.</Review>
            <Review>Their position in the league has slipped since Iron Man and co. But this one shows the X-Men still play a good mental game, one more suited for grown-ups who like their superpowered characters rubbing up against history and the real world.</Review>
            <Review>Yes, it's a Marvel cartoon, but don't underestimate this very entertaining summer blockbuster's ability to shift our collective consciousness. It can tinker with your dogma.</Review>
            <Review>X-Men: Days of Future Past is genuinely exciting and a complex addition to the franchise.</Review>
            <Review>It's an absolutely lavish bouquet to series fans, who get to see the entire X-saga summarized and effectively reconceived through Wolverine's desperate and time-addled perceptions.</Review>
            <Review>Fast-paced, darkly foreboding and plays loose and fast with the comic book and film canon.</Review>

            <Review>More puns, less story, please.</Review>
            <Review>Fifty years ago, animated entertainment was a lot quieter. But that was my "Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman." This is someone else's. And it should give them, and even a few open-minded parents, almost just as much giggly fun.</Review>
            <Review>It's better than OK, and a few elements sing; but overall it frustrates. Its delights come from its willingness to depart from formula, but formula still rules it.</Review>
            <Review>Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman has a cool, midcentury-modern look (dog and boy live in a populuxe Manhattan penthouse) and a voice cast that may not be A-list but fits the bill nicely.</Review>
            <Review>Mr. Peabody is fast-paced and jammed with rib-poking historical references, but it couldn't be called witty, even on the broadly winking level of the original cartoon.</Review>
            <Review>Throughout, the film remains one spunky wall-to-wall action film with several one-liners and lots of attitude.</Review>
            <Review>Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman is a well-made film that carries a broad appeal.</Review>
            <Review>A flawless remake that maintains the eccentric tone and wit of the original animated shorts.</Review>
            <Review>This film is inventive, fascinating and endearing but also sketch-lite, a trifle dull in colour-muting 3D and emotionally detached.</Review>
            <Review>This DreamWorks release avoids emotion in favor of toon-time movement.</Review>
            <Review>I'll be doggoned if 'Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman' isn't a refreshing 'paws' from the run-of-the-mill movies that often serve as family entertainment</Review>

            <Review>Within the confines of an under-two-hours running time ... Berlinger does an impressive job of keeping the film coherent and often fascinating.</Review>
            <Review>In this movie, corruption is rife on both sides of the blue line.</Review>
            <Review>With a large cast of wise guys, reporters, ex-cops, victims and lawyers, lawyers, lawyers, it's like five seasons of The Wire distilled into one epic episode.</Review>
            <Review>Joe Berlinger's densely detailed new documentary about the legendary Boston mobster is disturbing on so many levels it's hard not to wonder why Bulger was the only one on trial.</Review>
            <Review>"Whitey: United States of America v. James J. Bulger" takes all of our accumulated experience of places like "Southie" and makes it real. Terrifyingly, frustratingly real.</Review>
            <Review>Dense thickets of information, told via rostrum-shot photos and documents plus angry mob's worth of witnesses, become a grind after a while, as does the trite guitar-led mystery music.</Review>
            <Review>A thematic companion to Berlinger's 'Paradise Lost' trilogy, 'Whitey' is less a portrait of the 'hands-on killer who ran amok in the city of Boston for almost 30 years' than an expose of the misdeeds of law enforcement...</Review>
            <Review>A hard-hitting and for the most part crisply told crime exposé documentary on the legendary ruthless South Boston mob boss Whitey Bulger.</Review>
            <Review>To produce a documentary about a trial in which there are no cameras in the courtroom, and there's zero access to the man on trial, is quite a challenge. Challenge accepted- this is a standout doc.</Review>
            <Review>This documentary film is a real eye-opener. It turns out that corruption in all three branches of the federal government, legislative, administrative and judicial, is far worse than I thought it was.</Review>
            <Review>Whitey: United States of America vs. James J. Bulger would have been a more engrossing film had it picked one angle and pursued it.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>A swift, dark and nasty horror comedy that occasionally dances into territory deemed taboo by American filmmakers.</Review>
            <Review>"Witching and Bitching" is accordingly overlong, and conceptually thin. But like most of de la Iglesia's films, it's also freakishly energetic, and often hysterical.</Review>
            <Review>The buddy comedy, gross-out humor and horror elements make for a harmonious mix.</Review>
            <Review>Plenty of movies sympathize with outcasts, but only De La Iglesia's sympathize with their ugliest feelings: envy, resentment, and self-loathing.</Review>
            <Review>Projectile pukes its outrages at you with a gusto recalling the early days of those (sadly) reformed upchuckers Sam Raimi and Peter Jackson.</Review>
            <Review>Alex de la Iglesia has experimented with various genres down the years, but the shamelessly crowd-pleasing Witching and Bitching is a return to what he does best -- pure mayhem.</Review>
            <Review>Silly, ridiculous, and full of interesting mythology and visuals, Witching and Bitching is a wild ride to experience.</Review>
            <Review>Witches, sight gags and a treatise on the battle of the sexes? Witching &amp; Bitching gives you plenty to think about between the carnage.</Review>
            <Review>Alex de la Iglesia's horror-comedy Witching and Bitching lives up to the silliness of its title.</Review>
            <Review>Right from its subversive opening sequence, the film establishes itself as a silly but sometimes hilarious farce.</Review>
            <Review>Witching &amp; Bitching is an overly bizarre film that does fit Alex de la Iglesia's repertoire, but at the same time pushes the boundaries of fun and outrageous which results in a ludicrous atmosphere.</Review>
            <Review>It's warped, it's frantic, it's dark -- and it's an entertaining bit of guilty-pleasure, midnight-movie craziness</Review>

            <Review>She [Emmanuelle Devos] gives a tremendous performance, somehow managing to turn an emotion as ugly as self-loathing into something beautiful to behold.</Review>
            <Review>"Violette" demonstrates how suffering produces great art, and that the artist isn't the only one who suffers for it.</Review>
            <Review>It's a perfect approach to Leduc, whose work is so grounded in the messy, fleshy realities of life, it scandalized critics with its frank treatment of taboo subjects such as lesbianism and incest.</Review>
            <Review>A literate, leisurely and lovely telling of one woman's attempt to find what Virginia Woolf famously called "a room of one's own."</Review>
            <Review>So compelling, even thrilling, in its frank depictions of female sexual voracity, professional egotism and twisted variants on the Electra complex that it's easy to overlook [its] shaggy, uneven plotting.</Review>
            <Review>Movies about the literary process can prove problematic. The act of writing is a solitary one. Yet "Violette" mostly avoids the pitfalls associated with movies about writers by limiting the scenes of Violette scribbling furiously in a notebook.</Review>
            <Review>Emmanuelle Devos stars as volatile feminist writer Violette Leduc in Martin Provost's epic biopic, with Sandrine Kiberlain as her unrequited literary love, Simone de Beauvoir.</Review>
            <Review>Whilst requiring an investment of audience, it is full on without being emotionally draining and is a remarkable character study of a woman coming to terms with herself.</Review>
            <Review>[Leduc] remains a small and rather irritating sideshow to the more powerful St Germain crowd, and the focus on her life is surprisingly dull.</Review>
            <Review>The film is not just a passing parade of famous names but a journey through Leduc's struggles to overcome a tragic childhood, a domineering mother and a world that was unprepared for her candour and intense, confessional style of writing.</Review>
            <Review>It's Devos's outstanding performance that ensures this compels as both cultural history and human drama.</Review>
            <Review>Martin Provost ambitiously expands his tale across decades to give us a substantial look into a changing society through the eyes of one, influential protagonist.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Carlos is the most prestigious tailor in Granada, Spain. His life is a study in details, from the meticulous suits he creates for wealthy clients to the macabre murders he executes in the shadows. He performs these gruesome acts, including dining on the women he kills, without guilt or remorse. When Nina, a beautiful young immigrant from Romania, comes looking for her missing twin sister, she awakens in Carlos a kind of love he'd long since written off. As their relationship builds, based on secrets and deception, Nina's pure innocence will become undeniable, even by Carlos, a man driven by a dark secret. Cannibal is, in the end, a demon's love story. (c) Film Movement</StoryLine>

            <Review>A meticulous lead performance by Antonio de la Torre is the one saving grace of this dumb, arty horror movie from Spain.</Review>
            <Review>Knowing as little about Carlos as we do makes for a film that frustrates.</Review>
            <Review>Cuenca's mixture of beauty and grotesquerie brings enough edginess to Carlos' murderous and loving ways.</Review>
            <Review>Antonio de la Torre is brilliant as a killer and eater of young women in Manuel Martin Cuenca's sumptuously lensed psychological drama.</Review>
            <Review>No, this cannibal we do not root for -- although eventually we might feel pity.</Review>
            <Review>In the end, Cannibal stays too far away from the depravity at its center, to the point where Tailor might have been the more appropriate title.</Review>
            <Review>The film ultimately fails to work except as an aesthetic exercise.</Review>
            <Review>It keeps us at a remove that becomes telling of the filmmaker's reticence to explore whatever feelings of isolation and yearning may inform his main character's grisly compulsion.</Review>

        <Duration>116</Duration>
        <StoryLine>The official trailer for BENEATH THE HARVEST SKY is now available via Tribeca Film. Making its U.S. debut at this year's Tribeca Film Festival, BENEATH THE HARVEST SKY follows Casper (Emory Cohen, THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES) and Dominic (Callan McAuliffe, THE GREAT GATSBY), who have been fiercely loyal friends since childhood. Desperate for a way out of their quiet town on the Maine-Canada border, the boys make a pact to pool their earnings on a car and hit the road. But when Casper is drawn into drug smuggling with his outlaw father (Aidan Gillen, "The Wire," "Game of Thrones") to pay his share, their friendship is pushed to the brink and adult choices forced on them all too soon. A standout narrative debut from Aron Gaudet and Gita Pullapilly (THE WAY WE GET BY), BENEATH THE HARVEST SKY is a gripping coming-of-age thriller set against an authentic portrait of small-town American life.

            <Review>The languid pace effectively communicates the characters' crushing boredom, yet the dramatic interest never flags.</Review>
            <Review>While the climax of Beneath the Harvest Sky is a jumble of crosscutting, thunderstorms, and an inconveniently collapsing house, the movie never loses the pulse of people and tragedies it knows too well.</Review>
            <Review>For all its missteps, the film feels authentic. Through thick and thin, it stubbornly maintains a thorny integrity.</Review>
            <Review>Directors Aron Gaudet and Gita Pullapilly are documentarians making their fiction debut, and they pack the movie with seemingly authentic, nitty-gritty details about life in the potato country of far northern Maine.</Review>
            <Review>Teenagers in a dead-end town aren't exactly a trailblazing topic.</Review>
            <Review>Gaudet and Pullapilly have a background in documentaries, and there's a convincing naturalism to their storytelling.</Review>
            <Review>While we're never surprised at the outcomes, we're satisfied because few if any notes ring false.</Review>
            <Review>The performances in "Beneath the Harvest Sky" are better than the movie itself, an exceedingly derivative teen melodrama that too often loses focus and meanders off on lugubrious tangents with its criminal subplots.</Review>
            <Review>A story that unfolds nearly as slowly as the potatoes ripen in the fields, the charismatic performances of the two young leads make all the difference.</Review>
            <Review>Casper and Dominic are modern everymen -- theirs are not at all unique experiences, which is why their story resounds so loudly.</Review>
            <Review>Beneath the Harvest Sky never finds a proper balance between its two halves. They never cohere properly, and the results pitch and lurch rather than harmonize.</Review>
            <Review>An authentic representation of teenage angst. Beneath the Harvest Sky offers a genuine view of what it's like to grow up in rural poverty.</Review>

        <Duration>102</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Edinburgh, 1874. On the coldest day in the history of the world, little Jack is born with his heart frozen solid. Wasting no time, midwife Madeleine takes action and saves his life by inserting a cuckoo-clock in place of his icy heart. And now Jack will live...as long as he observes three golden rules: 1 - He must never touch the hands of the clock. 2 - He must master his anger. 3 - He must never, ever fall in love. But fall in love he does, to a bespectacled young street performer, Miss Acacia, with a soul-stirring voice. Now begins a journey of escape and pursuit, from Edinburgh to Paris to Miss Acacia's home in Andalusia. Based on the novel by Mathias Malzieu, Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart is a fantastical, wildly inventive tale of love and heartbreak - by turns poignant and funny - in which Jack finally learns the great joys, and ultimately the greater costs, of owning a fully formed heart.

            <Review>"Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart" stubbornly remains less than the sum of its parts. But its rich visual imagery suggests the talented artists involved could create something exciting and truly original if they had a better script.</Review>
            <Review>Malzieu has created a fully-realized, wildly imaginative storybook world and populated it with eccentric characters.</Review>
            <Review>This is a special gem of a movie.</Review>
            <Review>Imaginative steampunk musical is too dark for little kids.</Review>
            <Review>Even while wearing its obvious, name-dropped influences on its sleeve, Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart feels original in the sincerity of its magic.</Review>
            <Review>Animation fans will find much to enjoy...Those who nitpick at logic will find so many threads to pull apart that they'll be as cold as Jack by the end</Review>
            <Review>Rich with imagination and a pure pleasure to watch.</Review>
            <Review>Eccentric with some striking design touches, but humorless and heartless</Review>
            <Review>The film is at once enabled and hindered by its utter strangeness, an intrinsic quality surely exacerbated in its English-language release.</Review>
            <Review>Beautiful and hallucinatory, the greatest animated romance since Tim Burton's masterpiece CORPSE BRIDE. A revelation.</Review>

            <Review>With his trademark baritone and focused diction, Takei is a natural storyteller who lends an enjoyable flow to the movie's uncomplicated proceedings.</Review>
            <Review>To Be Takei is a celebration of a man of great resilience, infectious humor, a voracious appetite for the richness of the human experience, and the best laugh in the history of laughing.</Review>
            <Review>While there's pathos and tragedy here, there's also good humor and human strength.</Review>
            <Review>This is a film blessed with excellent footage and plenty of nice moments.</Review>
            <Review>Another pleasant if disposable portrait.</Review>
            <Review>This could have easily been a platitudinous, self-important mess, but Kroot does a couple of very savvy things here.</Review>
            <Review>Celebrates Takei but blithely neglects to probe for any complexity in a man who has surely suffered much.</Review>
            <Review>Can be more of a platform than a chronicle; its look at homophobia and gay marriage is a bit earnest and over-explained. Still, Takei provides a sharp lens through which to see ethnic and sexual minorities' progress in America's post-'50s popular culture.</Review>
            <Review>Before watching this film I thought of Takei as being just another celebrity, but this film makes it clear that Takei is a guy who has done something with his life. He has made his life count for something. He's a fascinating character.</Review>
            <Review>... a charming look at a man whose charisma and optimism is infectious in his quest to live long and prosper.</Review>
            <Review>No doc could diminish George Takei's life work, but To Be Takei too often takes dramatic short cuts which undermines its potency.</Review>
            <Review>A lively and warm tribute.</Review>

            <Review>Robespierre's direction of the many fine actors she assembled is assured, her sense of pacing nicely loose-limbed.</Review>
            <Review>Hats off to any film that tries (and succeeds) at presenting challenging, off-putting characters from whose palms I'm reluctantly persuaded to eat.</Review>
            <Review>Despite a few too-cute moments, the movie is both smarter and more sympathetic than that glib shorthand.</Review>
            <Review>A wonderfully offbeat film about, yes, an abortion.</Review>
            <Review>Slate is adept with biting remarks and self-deprecation, and she balances Donna somewhere between flightiness and innocence.</Review>
            <Review>Sorry, partisans, but there's nothing obvious about "Obvious Child."</Review>
            <Review>A sensitive, bawdy delight.</Review>
            <Review>The narrative goes in a direction that feels both familiar and surprisingly daring, and amongst some self-aware dialogue is a constant honesty with the situation at hand.</Review>
            <Review>The humor in Obvious Child never trivializes its characters' feelings, but instead provides a balance and the ability to explore more nuanced emotional situations.</Review>
            <Review>A frequently uneasy potluck of mixed emotional terrain, hit-and-miss jokes, and one transcendent performance that impressively, if messily, ties it all together.</Review>
            <Review>It's a frank, funny and emotionally sophisticated story that quietly declines to fall in line with what is expected of young women on the big screen.</Review>
            <Review>Obvious Child is bound to connect with lots of young women.</Review>

            <Review>Because they put the pedal to the metal and go full, screaming, bedazzled monkeypants crazy from beginning to end, it sort of works.</Review>
            <Review>Kind of hilarious. Kind of silly. Mostly a game of spot-the-cameo players and teasing about what moment a certain chainsaw will come in contact with certain bodies.</Review>
            <Review>As hard as we howled at the ghastliness being projected on the wall above us, I didn't see anyone at the Sharknado party who was giving the film his or her full attention, especially after the first 30 minutes.</Review>
            <Review>Syfy's made-for-TV movie Sharknado 2: The Second One is just as bad as the original Sharknado, which means it's just as good. It's the perfect way to kill two hours with one's brain in sleep mode.</Review>
            <Review>In other words, if you're in the Sharknado fan club, you'll probably like the sequel. If not, you'll probably ignore it and watch something else. In either case, enjoy.</Review>
            <Review>A movie needn't be great to make you feel great. The latter alone can be enough.</Review>
            <Review>It's a stupid, stupid movie, but also, in its own way, rather smart. Director Anthony C. Ferrante knows exactly what he is doing, and the results are as exceedingly amusing as they are entirely inconsequential.</Review>
            <Review>Simply put, it's one of those TV movies that's so unapologetically bad that it is, in its own unique way, also pretty great.</Review>
            <Review>It was definitely the second one, the big, spared-most-expenses sequel to the internet's favorite movie. Did it have highlights? Sure. Did it have lowlights? I can't remember. Will there be more of these? Count on it, dude.</Review>
            <Review>In a Rocky Horror sort of "so bad it's good" kind of way, Sharknado 2 is pretty fun in its silliness.</Review>
            <Review>Sharknado 2: The Second One is bad, and that's good. Well, it's meant to be bad, in a good sort of way.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Beneath the surface of humanity many of us are nervous and afraid - afraid because we know that we are expected to act in accordance with a placebo world, one that does not truly exist. We are expected to portray, uphold and obey an illusion of civilization that does not resemble the world in which we actually traffic. Andy Philips is one of many who cannot cope with that ''reality.'' He has to shut out a world that in essence is mad, a world where we deny our true will and the thoughts and desires of our conscious mind in order to find peace. There are many reasons why Andy, and others like him, kill and commit heinous acts of violence and desecration, a reason that stems fundamentally from the confusion and conflict within the collective soul of us all. Andy has a very dark place inside. A Dark Place Inside is a terrifying look inside the mind of a disturbed killer.</StoryLine>

            <Review>There is a gaping hole where "Million Dollar Arm"'s heart should be that widens to crater-size in the second half.</Review>
            <Review>Million Dollar Arm is cute, cloying, simplistic, borderline offensive ... and thoroughly effective.</Review>
            <Review>A well-made, enjoyably predictable, by-the-numbers sports drama.</Review>
            <Review>Hamm and Bell have real chemistry together and the supporting players - apart from Arkin's perfunctory performance - uniformly keep pace with the leads.</Review>
            <Review>The art of the deal gives way to matters of the heart, giving viewers a game changer both charming and uplifting.</Review>
            <Review>"Million Dollar Arm" is bland and overlong at 124 minutes. Simply put, there is nothing here of interest.</Review>
            <Review>Based on a true story, this is one of those relentlessly uplifting Disney movies that mixes comedy and emotion to inspire and move the audience.</Review>
            <Review>Craig Gillespie's by-numbers schmaltzathon never transcends its tourist's-eye views of India or patronisingly cliched views of its people.</Review>

        <StoryLine>From sci-fi author Philip K. Dick (Blade Runner, Minority Report, A Scanner Darkly) comes his most personal and prophetic thriller to date. It's 1985 in an alternate reality and Berkeley record store clerk Nick Brady (Jonathan Scarfe, Perception) begins to experience strange visions transmitted from an extra-terrestrial source he calls VALIS. He uproots his family and moves to Los Angeles where he becomes a successful music executive with a secret mission to overthrow the oppressive government led by US President Fremont (Scott Wilson - The Walking Dead). With the help of his best friend, sci-fi writer, Philip K. Dick himself (Shea Whigham - Boardwalk Empire, American Hustle) and a beautiful, mysterious woman named Silvia (Alanis Morissette - Weeds), Nick finds himself drawn into a conspiracy of cosmic, mind-shattering proportions. Although it might cost them their freedom or even their lives, they join forces to expose the dangerous truth about the corrupt regime.(C) Freestyle</StoryLine>

            <Review>A too-literal adaptation of Philip K. Dick's paranoid science fiction fantasy about government conspiracies, hidden realities, and conversations with parallel universes lacks the atmosphere and human feeling it demands to work on any level.</Review>

            <Review>Edge of Tomorrow is the perfect mix of blustering action and sci-fi thinky nonsense that is best enjoyed without picking at it too much.</Review>
            <Review>This is one of my favorite movies of the year so far.</Review>
            <Review>Edge of Tomorrow is a decent time waster, but if you're the sort of person who watches a movie every day, you should probably look for something better.</Review>
            <Review>The 51-year-old Cruise clearly relishes playing the flawed hero - one who gets to be smarmy, duplicitous, exasperated, intimidated, bad-ass and wise.</Review>
            <Review>The conceit may sound constricting, but Liman (like Harold Ramis before him) gets exceptional mileage out of it, presenting his ever-revolving tale with visual style, narrative velocity, and a wonderful dose of dark humor.</Review>
            <Review>This is a movie about Tom Cruise working very, very hard to please the world.</Review>
            <Review>A better video game movie than any movie based on a video game.</Review>
            <Review>Round and round we go, waiting for Tom Cruise to sprint through enough time-loop cycles to figure out how to kiss Emily Blunt amid the tarantula aliens. Very exciting!</Review>
            <Review>[Liman] reminds you that he was put on this earth to make popcorn thrillers. The ingenuity he brings to this disposable project is a sign of why Hollywood blockbusters continue to rule the globe.</Review>
            <Review>How Liman and Cruise deliver the repeated set-up scenes gives EoT plenty of light relief from warzone mayhem, the leading man's charms working a treat as he tries to convince those around him that he's seen it all before.</Review>
            <Review>Edge of Tomorrow is a superb novel-to-screen adaptation, based on the novel "All You Need is Kill" by Japanese author Hiroshi Sakurazaka.</Review>
            <Review>The core of often feels like a prolonged montage, immaculately polished and vibrant, but lacking the depth or cohesiveness of more interesting and realized works of science-fiction.</Review>

            <Review>The remake never manages to drum up much excitement for its sleepy hamlet rousing or for its characters, finally filled with purpose.</Review>
            <Review>The filmmakers hope for a fable-like charm rather than gritty credibility, but the whole thing feels as cynical as the villagers' convoluted mission.</Review>
            <Review>Thanks to its cast, "The Grand Seduction" turns out to be, if not exactly groundbreaking, at least agreeable, comfortable fun.</Review>
            <Review>It's all very sweet. And a big stretch.</Review>
            <Review>Loved Local Hero? Charmed by Waking Ned Devine? Then go watch Local Hero and Waking Ned Devine.</Review>
            <Review>So intricately plotted and unlikely that it verges on the exotic, "The Grand Seduction" is nevertheless a hoot.</Review>
            <Review>An old-fashioned ode to small-town working class values that moonlights as a screwball comedy.</Review>
            <Review>If McKellar could have just injected some of the eccentricity of his brilliant debut, Last Night, into proceedings we might have had an Ealing-esque social farce. Instead we're left with a comedy that's wry but prosaic.</Review>
            <Review>At best, this aspires to the whimsical charm of Local Hero; at worst, it simply steals from it.</Review>
            <Review>This is all about duels between rugged veterans. Cheery Gleeson and craggy Gordon Pinset steal the show.</Review>
            <Review>Though ultimately a somewhat forgettable feature film, The Grand Seduction does have a lot of heart and a certain charm to it which makes for an easy, gratifying experience.</Review>
            <Review>A comedy drama that offers a portrait of the Emerald Isle that is contrived in its quaintness.</Review>

            <Review>Slickly directed by actor Mike Myers, it intersperses Gordon's sunny reminiscences with testimony from an army of A-list clients and celebrity pals. Admittedly, there are great stories here.</Review>
            <Review>It may leave you asking: Why did I just watch that old guy's birthday tape?</Review>
            <Review>Yes, there is some gravity in the film, but mostly it's the rock-and-roll story of a rock-and-roll life (even though one of his favorite clients was Canadian folk singer Anne Murray).</Review>
            <Review>How can you not love this guy, this story?</Review>
            <Review>For all the love emanating from client-pals Michael Douglas, Sylvester Stallone, Emeril Lagasse, and Steven Tyler, there's a sadness to this movie that remains just off camera.</Review>
            <Review>Mike Myers makes his directorial debut by chronicling the fascinating life of one of Hollywood's most fabled raconteurs and charismatic talent managers.</Review>
            <Review>This is a fascinating insight into the Hollywood machine through terrific old footage of some iconic faces. But it's Shep himself who makes this film so engaging.</Review>
            <Review>If the film is often pure hagiography, it's rescued by the huge charm of its subject, whose present-day interviews reveal a figure of compassion and humility.</Review>
            <Review>The stories are great... the kind of crazy Hollywood tales that could've only happened in the '70s.</Review>
            <Review>You may not have heard of this Hollywood legend, but you definitely know a few of his famous friends.</Review>
            <Review>The absurdly-paraphrased version of the story we come away with is that Gordon is the nicest guy to ever have worked in Hollywood and that good things happen to good people.</Review>
            <Review>He's splendidly charismatic company, as his A-list roster attests en masse.</Review>

            <Review>A Million Ways to Die in the West feels like about 80 minutes of material was padded out to 110 minutes.</Review>
            <Review>The movie, which MacFarlane directed and cowrote with Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild, is clever about its anachronisms. You stay surprised.</Review>
            <Review>In A Million Ways to Die in the West, director-star Seth MacFarlane builds an imposing, affectionate reconstruction of the American movie West, then defaces it with funny mustaches -- often literally.</Review>
            <Review>If you measure a comedy by how many times you laughed, Seth MacFarlane's A Million Ways to Die in the West, at least for me, is a middling success.</Review>
            <Review>But for all its hit-and-miss jokes, there are lots of ways to die laughing at this Western raunchfest.</Review>
            <Review>Neil Patrick Harris owns the movie's funniest scene, involving not one, but two bowler hats and no relief in sight.</Review>
            <Review>The funniest thing about One Million Ways ...? How come McFarlane was much more convincing as Ted than he is here as a real person.</Review>
            <Review>MacFarlane's aim is true when it comes to the pic's continuous meta-commentary.</Review>
            <Review>[MacFarlane] thinks he's winking-making bad jokes to subvert their precise calculation with awkward explanations he hopes conjure laughs-but it's a plea of desperation.</Review>
            <Review>Although hardly 'Blazing Saddles,' the movie is pretty funny when it depicts the Old West as a place of such 'general depressing awfulness' it can sink a person into 'a disgusting, awful, dirty cesspool of despair.'</Review>
            <Review>There are moments of wit in the script, and one or two strong scenes, but the film feels oddly directionless for much of its runtime.</Review>

        <Duration>108</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Adapted by John Gregory Dunne and Joan Didion from Dunne's novel, True Confessions uses the still-unsolved "Black Dahlia" murder as the foundation for a devastating attack on big-city corruption -- in which it appears that many of the perpetrators wear clerical collars. In, 1948 Los Angeles detective Tom Spellacy (Robert Duvall) is assigned to investigate the death of a priest, who apparently suffered a heart attack while being serviced by a prostitute. Meanwhile, Tom's brother, young Catholic monsignor Des Spellacy (Robert De Niro), is reluctantly currying favor with crooked contractor Jack Amsterdam (Charles Durning), the better to finance an expansion of Des' church. The unifying factor between Tom and Des, beyond their sibling relationship, turns out to be the grisly murder of a hooker. The key words in the labyrinthine proceedings are power, ambition, and hypocrisy. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>Two exciting, dangerous actors have little to do: Duvall spends too much time pacing and waiting; De Niro's big scene has him hanging up his vestments.</Review>
            <Review>Given the powerhouse topline casting combo and provocative theme, True Confessions has to be chalked up as something of a disappointment.</Review>
            <Review>Numerous vital characters are dropped and the case-solving stripped of its complexity, with the resulting film over-linear and one-dimensional.</Review>
            <Review>True Confessions contains scenes that are just about as good as scenes can be. Then why does the movie leave us disoriented and disappointed, and why does the ending fail dismally?</Review>
            <Review>A fascinating film that exposes the dark underside of the Catholic Church and fixes it firmly in the seedy, corrupt world of film noir.</Review>

        <StoryLine>A young artist living in New York, tries to make a living sketching passers-by on the street. He survives on his meager means and has found refuge in an abandoned building. One night, on the corner of a back alley, he finds a little girl whose father has just been murdered. While struggling to take care of her, he meets a young rich woman who immediately falls in love with this awkward couple. Twenty years before The Artist, Sidewalk Stories portrays the friendship of a tramp and a child, in a moving and funny homage to Chaplin's The Kid. Both witty and tender, Charles Lane's gorgeous black and white comedy pays tribute to the silent film era, as well as capturing the life of homeless New Yorkers.</StoryLine>

            <Review>A poetic if occasionally opaque film essay on the 1945 Battle of Okinawa.</Review>

            <Review>An ode to selective memory and oblivion</Review>
            <Review>"Level Five" plays like a lost CD-ROM rediscovered in some thrift-store bargain bin.</Review>
            <Review>The theories in "Level Five" simultaneously thrive in realms of computer science, ethnography, and cognitive psychology, while the picture remains cloaked by the emotional weight of a historical tragedy that marked an entire nation.</Review>
            <Review>Already a cult film nearly 20 years old, Level Five makes its U.S. theatrical debut, and the wait has turned the viewing experience into something even more meditative than director Chris Marker might have intended.</Review>
            <Review>...[Level Five] effortlessly anticipated the aesthetic and thematic shifts of 21st-century cinema, even as it addressed the history and legacy of the 20th.</Review>
            <Review>Tension is explored between the medium and the message - namely, how history becomes selectively fashioned for the medium through which it is depicted rather than the other way around.</Review>
            <Review>This film demands every cell of your cerebellum, but its compelling surreality is hard to shake off.</Review>

        <Title>Topkapi</Title>
        <ReleaseDate/>
        <Duration>122</Duration>
        <StoryLine>After years of enduring movie lampoons of his 1955 crime-caper classic Rififi, director Jules Dassin topped them all with his own spoof, Topkapi. It's a rather disreputable crew that teams for the elaborate jewel theft masterminded by Maximillian Schell. Sexy Melina Mercouri (Mrs. Dassin) is probably the best of the batch: the others are faffling Robert Morley, unreliable Gilles Segal and Jess Hahn. Bumbling Peter Ustinov (who won an Oscar for his performance) is duped into helping the thieves, and soon finds himself uneasily straddling both sides of the law. As in Rififi, the theft itself (taking place in Istanbul's Topkapi Palace museum) is played out in near-complete silence. We won't tell you how the crooks are foiled; just be advised that money flies out the door when something else flies in the window. Topkapi was based on The Light of Day, a somewhat more somber novel by Eric Ambler. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <Title>Billion Dollar Brain</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 1966</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>111</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Harry Palmer (Michael Caine), the reluctant secret agent from The Ipcress File (1965) and Funeral in Berlin (1966) -- both (like the source for this movie) based on novels by Len Deighton -- is back again in Ken Russell's Billion Dollar Brain. Having left Britain's espionage service, Palmer is scraping out a living as a private investigator, but he's still willing to give his old boss Colonel Ross (Guy Doleman) the bum's rush out of his office when he comes calling, offering a raise and promotion if he'll return. But Palmer ends up working for Her Majesty's government anyway -- a letter arrives, with a key and money, and telephoned instructions by a mechanical voice connect him up with a carefully sealed parcel (filled with what an x-ray reveals as eggs) that he must transport to Helsinki. No sooner does he get there than he discovers that an old friend, Leo Newbigin (Karl Malden), and his young lover Anya (Fran�oise Dorl�ac) are behind the trip, and that the man who was supposed to receive the parcel is dead. The eggs contain dangerous viruses stolen from a secret British laboratory, and England wants them back and wants to know why they were stolen. That assignment immerses Palmer in a deadly game of deception, double-dealing, and triple-crosses on all sides, as he finds that Leo is working for a privately operated intelligence network, set up by a rabidly right-wing Texas oil man, General Midwinter (Ed Begley Sr.). The billion-dollar super-computer of the title, built by Midwinter, runs a network of spies and assassins aimed at the destruction of the Soviet Union. That interests Palmer's old friend, Soviet security chief Colonel Stok (Oskar Homolka, in an almost movie-stealing performance), very much, and he, too, wants to know what Palmer knows. And then there's Leo, who has taken millions from Midwinter, supposedly to establish a secret underground in Latvia, waiting for the signal to rise up against the Soviets occupying their country that will spread across the Baltics and beyond and bring down the Soviet government. He's taken the money, but all Harry find when he goes into Latvia is motley bunch of broken-down black marketeers whose orders are to kill him and make it look like the work of the Soviets. And there's Anya, who is sleeping with Leo, trying to seduce Harry, and seems to have an agenda all her own, but in whose interest? If it's all a little confusing, so was the book on which it was based, but there's enough striking visual material, courtesy of cinematographer Billy Williams, and engrossing performances (and a wry sensibility), courtesy of director Ken Russell and screenwriter John McGrath, that the leaps in plot, logic, and setting don't matter that much, and it is great fun. ~ Bruce Eder, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>A by-the-numbers tale of inspiration through perspiration.</Review>
            <Review>4 Minute Mile at least has the decency to acknowledge that it's aware of its underdog sports-movie clichés, especially the ones that made The Karate Kid such an '80s classic.</Review>
            <Review>Even if the story itself has been around the track a couple of times, veterans like these know how to bring it safely home.</Review>
            <Review>More than one interior scene looks underlit for effect,but that's at least something else to think about as the film goes through its paces.</Review>
            <Review>It's a moving, if occasionally heavy-handed, sports drama that deserves a wider audience than it is probably going to find in its limited release.</Review>
            <Review>A finely written and directed sports drama with a lead performance by rising star Kelly Blatz so deep and affecting it often evokes Timothy Hutton's Oscar-winning turn in "Ordinary People."</Review>
            <Review>A lazily derivative underdog sporting yarn, 4 Minute Mile treads tired ground.</Review>
            <Review>This earnest redemption drama fails to go the distance with sentimental tendencies and trite lessons of perseverance.</Review>
            <Review>Even with Richard Jenkins's strong turn as a grizzled mentor and ex-athlete, 4 Minute Mile is a limp sports drama that fails to be inspirational or inspired.</Review>
            <Review>There's a similar redolence to 4 Minute Mile overall-the odor of a hard-working but underachieving movie that's 99 percent perspiration and 1 percent inspiration.</Review>
            <Review>Has the capacity to explore some compelling areas of doubt, but the screenplay by Josh Campbell and Jeff Van Wie goes overboard in an attempt to secure tears.</Review>
            <Review>4 Minute Mile is watchable thanks to Richard Jenkins, but its overall blandness and familiarity will cause it to evaporate from your memory in a flash.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Filmmakers Deidre Schoo and Michael Beach Nichols turn their cameras on a group of Brooklyn dancers and street performers whose talent may provide them with the means of transcending their meager beginnings in this inspirational, visually-striking documentary. Flex is a form of competitive dance that involves contortion, agility, and simulated violence. It's a particularly difficult art form to master, and even for the few who manage to do so, there's no guarantee it will lead to greater things. Schoo and Nichols introduce us to a handful of talented Flex dancers who are determined to evolve their art, and make a name for themselves while doing so. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi</StoryLine>

Deanna's boyfriend is deeply threatened by Sean and Deanna's friendship, resulting in a violent confrontation. Seeking to protect himself, Sean issues a death threat online, and is swiftly arrested. When the police raid Sean's home, they find rifles, shotguns, knives and ammunition - all property of Sean's father RICKY (Michael Buie), an avid hunter. They also find a sup- posed "revenge plan" targeting over twenty people who have tormented Sean. The authorities and the media proclaim another Columbine situation has been narrowly averted, and soon Sean faces a terrifying imprisonment in a youth detention facility.

            <Review>The clock starts to drag, and some energy is lost. But the movie displays a lot of promise both in front of and behind the lens.</Review>
            <Review>Credit to Buxton here for extracting conviction from such young actors. The performances aren't wholly redemptive, but they are compelling.</Review>
            <Review>This well-paced chase thriller stars Eric Bana and Olivia Wilde as sibling crooks on the run from a botched casino heist.</Review>
            <Review>This debut feature from Nova Scotia filmmaker Jason Buxton offers a series of subtle revelations that challenge expectation without a hint of soapbox grandstanding or raging primal screams.</Review>
            <Review>Though I appreciate Buxton's rookie attempt to present an alternative look at teen rage, I can't help seeing that this overreaching film goes nowhere with only clichés to guide it.</Review>
            <Review>Told with a rare mix of humanity and procedural clarity that recalls, nay, honours the late, great Alan Clarke.</Review>
            <Review>...the film ultimately feels much, much longer than its 103 minutes.</Review>

        <Title>The Prosecution of an American President</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2012</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>100</Duration>
        <StoryLine>This electrifying film documents the efforts of Vincent Bugliosi, one of our nation's foremost prosecutors, as he presents his case that former president George W. Bush should be prosecuted for the deaths of American soldiers in Iraq because he deliberately took our nation to war under false pretenses. Based on Bugliosi's New York Times bestseller, the movie discloses shocking hidden details of how Bush and his people systematically lied to Congress and the country. He shows incontrovertible evidence that Bush, Cheney, Rice, et al committed a monumental crime under our constitution and the laws of this land. He leads us through a legal understanding of what is needed to bring a formal prosecution, setting the stage for what would be the biggest and most important trial in U.S. history. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>85</Duration>
        <StoryLine>One of the greatest restaurants in the world is closing and an eclectic mix of international patrons have arrived in beautiful Catalonia for the final dinner service in this witty and delicious ensemble comedy. As the staff prepare and serve an audacious tasting menu, a young couple in the midst of a divorce who made their reservation a year ago (before separating) reunite for this once-in-a-lifetime meal. Can their romance be rekindled with the help of the widow dining with her husband's ashes? Will the brilliant chef be able to pull off a perfect finale? An Irish and Spanish co-production, TASTING MENU, like all great ensemble dramedies centered on culinary delights, is a crowd-pleasing mishmash of relationships, feuds, and broken dreams that are mended through the simple act of "breaking bread" and the universal appreciation of great food. Similar in style to foodie classics like BIG NIGHT and CHOCOLAT, TASTING MENU will leave you awash in a European sensation of joie de vivre. (c) Magnolia</StoryLine>

            <Review>Nothing truly creates any emotional waves, and little seems at stake, no matter what potential disaster might seem to be in the offing.</Review>
            <Review>Unfortunately, Roger Gual's half-baked film hopes to split the difference between romantic comedy and foodie delight but fails at both.</Review>
            <Review>Even with such fine actors as Fionnula Flanagan and Stephen Rea in the ensemble, the Spanish-Irish co-production is a flavorless affair that has all the bite of a dining room-bound episode of "The Love Boat."</Review>

            <Review>Haute-cuisine comedy doesn't deliver on food or laughs.</Review>
            <Review>Tasting Menu is an ensemble piece that is about as light as a puff pastry, though far from as mouthwatering.</Review>

            <Review>The way the women occupy Cohen and Plioplyte's spotlight is a lesson in aging well, a lesson that begins with the refusal to play by the rule that says to grow older, especially for women, is to fade into the shadows.</Review>

            <Review>Veering away from these women's style-philosophies, witticisms, families, health concerns, or their pasts, the doc becomes promotional and proselytizing. Personalities get camera-brushed into commercial gloss, a simplistic patina of fashionability.</Review>

            <Review>Initially the late-80s setting of Cold in July registers as kitsch, but it grows more evocative as the Carpenter impersonation gives way to something weirder and uglier.</Review>
            <Review>Hall does his best to make sense of Dane, but the plot turns simply don't add up. Good work in a not-so-good movie.</Review>
            <Review>Pulp fiction doesn't come much better than Cold in July, a gritty, grisly - and perversely giddy - crime yarn directed by Pottstown-born indie-film provocateur Jim Mickle.</Review>
            <Review>A tense, engrossing Texas thriller with a sense of humor as sharp and wounding as a Bowie knife.</Review>
            <Review>It is a brutal, beautifully shot movie that starts out to be about revenge but then becomes something more, something even more primal and disturbing.</Review>
            <Review>While the unforeseen places it goes kept me engaged, unearned character motivations, and an awkward genre balance prevent this from being a knock-out exploitation noir entry.</Review>
            <Review>[Cold in July is] an absorbing take on the modern family noir, a movie that knows the devil's in the details.</Review>
            <Review>Bristling with sharp surprises at every dark turn, punctuated by crackling performances from a first-rate cast and filmed with a haunting moodiness, Cold in July is a perfect little film</Review>
            <Review>A few too many twists and turns, but Johnson and Shepard help save it</Review>
            <Review>A heart-stoppingly tense, cunningly twisty crime thriller</Review>
            <Review>The 'That's for the hat' speech is a delicious bit of fun, but the film's final third is so derivative and keen to shock if feels like a different movie entirely.</Review>

            <Review>At once a spoof of, and loving tribute to, '70s-era visions of the future, Space Station 76 nods to 2001 in numerous ways.</Review>
            <Review>This may look like a wacky spoof of 1970s sci-fi, but Jack Plotnick's beautifully designed comedy-drama actually has a lot more on its mind.</Review>
            <Review>"Space Station 76" stretches every penny, from the curving white walls of the station to the men's wide-collared shirts, but it also demonstrates the kind of talentand determination that no amount of money can buy a filmmaker who doesn't have them.</Review>
            <Review>It never seems to be mocking its characters. It feels for them. Sometimes its heart breaks for them.</Review>
            <Review>It's hard to say what the creators of "Space Station 76" were aiming for. But whatever it was, they didn't achieve it.</Review>
            <Review>A protracted, scattershot comedy sketch that never quite nails its tone.</Review>
            <Review>While enthralled with its own retro-futuristic trappings at heart, this is a pitch-black dramedy with a mean-streak.</Review>
            <Review>There's a lot to admire around the edges, but Plotnick's film isn't quite an out-of-this-world experience based on its own merits.</Review>
            <Review>Even with the melodrama and comedic elements, there's a deep sense of sincerity to performances happening on-screen.</Review>
            <Review>The script never quite matches the laser-sighted wit of the visuals.</Review>
            <Review>It's not a movie that will appeal to everyone's sensibilities, but if you like your comedy clever and subtle with a heaping of great character exploration, this one's for you.</Review>
            <Review>Daringly changes tone, and challenges expectation, without ever missing the beat. The acting and the design are consistently spot-on in their homage to the '70s, but it's smarter and deeper than the gag-fest you might expect.</Review>

            <Review>The movie's main point of value is in Morton's performance.</Review>
            <Review>Decoding Annie Parker is a movie about resilience, about staring doom straight in the face - with a smile, with hope.</Review>
            <Review>This modest indie with major ambitions is directed by veteran cinematographer Steven Bernstein, making a solid feature debut.</Review>
            <Review>Tears are shed in "Decoding Annie Parker," but they aren't accompanied by the kind of sad, misty soundtrack music that can leave you feeling used and abused. Instead of jerking tears, the movie edifies.</Review>
            <Review>"Decoding Annie Parker," though uneven in its execution, has at its heart two remarkable women and one remarkable performance.</Review>
            <Review>It sticks mostly to one track, taking audience members on a journey that, sadly, via the movies or their own lives, they already may know a little too well.</Review>
            <Review>This is lamentably short of humour. It's also lamentably short of coherence and seems to have been edited by someone with delirium tremens.</Review>
            <Review>There's a passion to tell this story with an understated urgency and profound empathy that can be felt in every frame of this terrific film.</Review>
            <Review>Samantha Morton gives a fabulous performance.</Review>
            <Review>I think it's an extremely worthy film... the performances are very good.</Review>
            <Review>Samantha Morton's audacious portrayal of the title character boosts this mildly inspirational but sentimental true-life drama.</Review>
            <Review>Powerful if a bit uneven docudrama about cancer, research.</Review>

        <StoryLine>DELIVERY: THE BEAST WITHIN tells the story of Kyle and Rachel Massy, a young couple who agree to document their first pregnancy for a family-oriented reality show. As the camera continues to capture strange events, Rachel begins to believe that a malevolent spirit has possessed their unborn child. Told through the show's un-aired footage and interviews with friends, family and production members, this savvy debut feature leverages the voyeuristic properties of reality television to present a fresh perspective on classic horror themes of possession and the paranormal-- and delivers enough eeriness to keep you on the edge of your seat.

            <Review>A horror movie can be many things, but one thing it should never, ever be is tedious.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>It's such a treat to see such an endearing slice o' life in the middle of this blockbuster season. There's not a single comic book character in sight.</Review>
            <Review>Chef is compelling, somewhat convincing and, according to many who know better than I, it's largely on trend.</Review>
            <Review>Favreau has assembled a terrific cast for a road trip that is joyous and revelatory, all set to a great soundtrack ...</Review>
            <Review>It's a refreshing change of pace from typical summer fare, a story not framed around the skeleton of an old TV series or designed as a tie-in to Hasbro toys.</Review>
            <Review>If "Chef" were a musical, you'd walk out humming the food - and you might end up doing that anyway.</Review>
            <Review>Chef is so thin and bland it doesn't even inspire contempt.</Review>
            <Review>Favreau lets his character not only have flaws, but also allows him to grow without actually fixing those flaws.</Review>
            <Review>Chef can take its place at the table alongside the great movies about food, among them Big Night, Babette's Feast and Chocolat.</Review>
            <Review>"Chef" might not be the return to form that Favreau and his fans were hoping for, but it's a gentle reminder of his charm, a charm that's gone unattended for far too long.</Review>
            <Review>Favreau isn't trying anything new, whether in the story or presentation of the story, so this is comforting feel-good custard, presented as crème brûlée. Charming in its own way, but not really nouvelle or even novel cuisine.</Review>
            <Review>The film transcends to something special - if only briefly - in a moment of silent reflection upon Carl's return from the road trip. The contrived tearjerker that immediately ensues could almost be forgiven.</Review>
            <Review>It's incredibly sweet, but still perplexing with its dashes of bitter.</Review>

            <Review>"Third Person" is such a solipsistic, navel-gazing creation that it seems to have barely made it out of Haggis' mind and onto the screen.</Review>
            <Review>Even if the story begins to melt into itself, at the end it's still fascinating to watch Haggis move his players.</Review>
            <Review>It's all, I'm sorry to say, a melodramatic slog.</Review>
            <Review>"Third Person" doesn't lack for ambition, and it's nice to see Neeson in the kind of role that he excelled at before he morphed into an action star. But the film may have some folks wishing they'd bought a ticket to "Transformers 4" instead.</Review>
            <Review>Trust is essential to any love relationship, writer-director Paul Haggis wants us to know, though he trusts us so little to grasp this theme ourselves that he makes his alter ego here, a world-weary novelist played by Liam Neeson, spell it out.</Review>
            <Review>Plumbing emotional depths, Haggis turns the characters' tribulations onto the viewer: If white is the color of trust -- as Neeson's author writes -- aren't we all a little gray?</Review>
            <Review>What's that noise? It's the Metafiction Police coming to arrest this over-ambitious, pompous jiggery-pokery.</Review>
            <Review>The question is if he realizes he more or less admitted to being a sociopath who remorselessly exploits the pain of those around him for the sake of drama.</Review>
            <Review>A pretentious wreck of a movie that severely tests the patience.</Review>
            <Review>Third Person has a number of distinct themes at work, manifested through characters and plots that are a mixed bag of believable and baffling.</Review>
            <Review>When we reach our finale you can't help but feel somewhat detached and uninvolved in this title.</Review>
            <Review>Third Person suffers from a script that fails to hook you in during its opening section and drags on without sufficient emotional connection for 137 minutes.</Review>

            <Review>This pleasant but eminently forgettable indie comedy is the sort of thing that makes you wonder whether the big names in the cast were having serious career problems, doing someone a favor, or just had a few weeks to kill.</Review>

            <Review>Collette, as amazing as she can be when given something to work with, can't lift this limp story through sheer will.</Review>
            <Review>Director Megan Griffiths and writers Huck Botko and Emily Wachtel flesh out a female perspective that's refreshing and engrossing without demonizing or objectifying men.</Review>
            <Review>Lucky Them is an emotionally satisfying journey, subverting expectations of the charming road movie.</Review>
            <Review>Lucky Them touches on the price of fame, and conjures up memories of Kurt Cobain, Jeff Buckley and Elliot Smith. But, more importantly, it's about those left behind and what they face in not knowing what happened to their loved ones.</Review>
            <Review>A study of the perils of nostalgia, Megan Griffiths' Lucky Them itself comes off as a throwback to an earlier era of low-key, whimsical US independent cinema. This is not a bad thing, considering the talents of the cast.</Review>
            <Review>The plot executes an impressive twist at the end and Collette makes such a swashbuckler out of Ellie that you're inclined to indulge her in whatever she chooses to do.</Review>
            <Review>Griffiths helms the feature with low-key fondness and a lived-in atmosphere, the camera caressing the Seattle spaces the story calls home, and lingering lovingly over the more rural places Ellie and Charlie venture to.</Review>

            <Review>Davis's performance, his sense of theatricality, and his villainous make-up are deeply missed.</Review>
            <Review>Leprechaun: Origins isn't just bad - it's downright insulting. Lipovski's film is nothing but a series of bad choices, worse execution and infuriating redundancy, highlighting the ugliness that comes along with exploiting horror instead of respecting it.</Review>
            <Review>Even the cheapest, most shoddy productions can manage some thrills, kills, and laughs with memorable characters and a cohesive plot when skilled filmmakers are at the helm. Leprechaun: Origins, unfortunately, offers none of these things.</Review>

            <Review>Since the film is a chilling two hours and 45 minutes long, that means one's mind quickly wanders, dancing across this film's many flaws, little and big.</Review>
            <Review>The few authentic inspirations to be found in the movie's hundred and sixty-five roiling minutes involve gigantic science-fiction contrivances.</Review>
            <Review>It barely matters whether this movie is good or bad. Bay is now the sort of filmmaker -- the only one, perhaps -- whose moviemaking goes beyond such binary banality.</Review>
            <Review>In the end, though, this is still a movie about giant robots fighting each other, which is to say it's nearly impossible to take seriously on a narrative level.</Review>
            <Review>Inflated, interminable and incoherent ...</Review>
            <Review>You're either awestruck, dumbstruck or just plain struck in the face.</Review>
            <Review>On the one hand, Transformers: Age of Extinction is barely coherent, narratively disastrous, and oppressively long. On the other: Optimus Prime riding a dinosaur robot!</Review>
            <Review>The elements of a Transformer movie: cool machinery, a long-legged jail-bait female of stunning visage, cornfields/sunsets; witty dialog: 'Dude, she's an evil jock-concubine.'</Review>
            <Review>As the series' least terrible entry to date, "Age Of Extinction" is all at once refreshing and generally pointless.</Review>
            <Review>The running time of 2 hours and 45 minutes allows plenty of time for lots of explosions and inane dialogue.</Review>
            <Review>Transformers: Age of Extinction is as close to an incoherent mess of movement &amp; noise as cinema gets. Michael Bay is slowly perfecting his brand of blockbuster, and to be honest it's getting quite compelling to watch him fall down this rabbit hole</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>98</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Writer/director Kat Candler's HELLION paints the powerful portrait of a family on the brink of dissolution set against the haunting backdrop of the refineries of Southeast Texas. Obsessed with heavy metal, dirt bike racing and partaking in the occasional act of vandalism with his band of delinquents, the behavior of 13-year-old Jacob Wilson (Josh Wiggins in his feature film debut) has begun to raise concerns around town, especially when it starts to involve his younger brother Wes (newcomer Deke Garner). While the boys' father Hollis (two-time Emmy Award-winner Aaron Paul) loves his sons, he is still reeling from the loss of their mother, spending more time drowning his sorrows at the local bar and working on his damaged beach house than being an active parent.

            <Review>Despair is not quiet for a broken father (Aaron Paul) and his troublemaker sons in Kat Candler's brisk, transfixing drama, which takes place in blue-collar southeast Texas.</Review>
            <Review>"Hellion" pads its slender, commonplace, but potentially rewarding premise with contrivances, clichés, repetitiousness, and, when all else fails, implausible, arbitrary melodrama.</Review>
            <Review>Wiggins gives the boy's struggles a raw realism, but it's not enough to shore up this slackly paced slice of sunbaked Texas miserabilism.</Review>
            <Review>Not that inarticulate characters can't be compelling if they are written with subtlety, acted with insight and, most of all, framed by a directorial vision, but "Hellion," despite a promising debut from Wiggins, falls short in at least two of the above.</Review>
            <Review>The acting overall is strong, but Paul, still testing the waters after "Breaking Bad," is extraordinarily controlled.</Review>
            <Review>The hellion of "Hellion" is Jacob Wilson, a 13-year-old Texas rebel with a cause. As played by a real teenager, Josh Wiggins, he's a force of nature.</Review>
            <Review>Candler paints this broken family with an authenticity that draws one in and forces us to feel their suffocating inability to escape their own pain.</Review>
            <Review>"Hellion" just can't quite convince or coalesce its ideas of struggle, pain and fury in a meaningful or new way.</Review>
            <Review>Hellion paints a plaintive portrait of a family trapped in the bottom echelon of America's middle class.</Review>
            <Review>"Hellion" has nothing if not empathy for every one of its characters. But without a more original story or a distinctive visual presence, it's hard for it to rise above a crowded field.</Review>
            <Review>The realism in "Hellion" is admirable, as are the actors' emotion performances. These wrenching qualities also make the film a tough sell.</Review>
            <Review>Hellion fits into something I like to call the "festival bubble".</Review>

            <Review>It's funny, clunky, earnest, and barely credible, but it's all of a piece.</Review>
            <Review>A comedy with no laughs. A drama disconnected from any known reality.</Review>
            <Review>Everything about Are You Here feels like a bottom-drawer script idea that was put together too casually and carelessly.</Review>
            <Review>Are You Here lacks more than just the question mark that should go on its title. It lacks a point-of-view that makes sense, that feels central.</Review>
            <Review>"Are You Here" doesn't feel all there.</Review>
            <Review>"Are You Here" proves a gently immersive, ingratiating, often witty character comedy with a pair of comfortably effective lead performances.</Review>
            <Review>We don't know what 'Are You Here' means, but we do know Owen Wilson is Steve Dallas, a weatherman. Or maybe a weatherman-ish boy. Or weatherboy-ish man. He needs to grow up.</Review>
            <Review>Having penned various episodes for both Mad Men and The Sopranos, what Weiner manages to squeeze into an entire season he's attempted to fit into almost two hours of cinema with this particular endeavour.</Review>
            <Review>Wilson and Galifianakis are very much playing to type as slick charmer and manic weirdo, but the movie around them is much less predictable, veering off in strange directions and never finding a consistent tone.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is the cinematic equivalent of dead air.</Review>
            <Review>The film struggles to find a consistent tone between its attempts at broad stoner comedy, fractured family quirks and a more serious examination of mental illness.</Review>
            <Review>In the end, Are You Here isn't quite funny enough to be a comedy, nor does it take itself seriously enough to be a drama. I would say that it's a dramedy, but the tone is so erratic that it doesn't really fit in that category either.</Review>

            <Review>What makes "Ivory Tower" interesting is how it looks at not just the debt but the causes behind it, and other problems besetting higher education.</Review>
            <Review>A groaning table of food for thought - almost too much for one movie, though presented with remarkable deftness.</Review>
            <Review>"Ivory Tower" makes a persuasive case that the gravest epidemic that's spreading from college campuses isn't student-loan debt but attention-deficit disorder.</Review>
            <Review>One of the most interesting discoveries is that it's not just students who are in debt. In the spirit of competitiveness, colleges have had to up the ante.</Review>
            <Review>Rossi gives us a survey course when what we need is a seminar; the movie is a useful "What's Wrong With College 101" but the advanced study remains to be done.</Review>
            <Review>Though the filmmakers take on too much in 90 minutes, they pass the test by convincing us that something needs to be done to end this financial nightmare, which can cost $60,000 per year per student.</Review>
            <Review>Lots of sympathy, but few answers to the problem of the high price of college</Review>
            <Review>Very informative documentary about the corporatization of the academy, drawing from experts as well as boneheaded libertarians like Peter Thiel who hoists himself on his own petard.</Review>
            <Review>All in all, Ivory Tower is balanced and comprehensive.</Review>
            <Review>I'm just as perplexed now as I was before watching the movie.</Review>
            <Review>Sobering documentary on the spiraling high tuition in America's colleges.</Review>
            <Review>This film makes a convincing argument that the higher education system in America is headed toward collapse. Financing the system largely with student debt is unsustainable.</Review>

        <Duration>79</Duration>
        <StoryLine>On April 20, 2011, shortly after the release of his documentary RESTREPO - and only six weeks after attending the Oscar ceremony as a nominee - photographer and filmmaker Tim Hetherington was killed by mortar fire in the city of Misrata, Libya, where he'd been covering the civil war. He bled out in the back of a pick-up truck while being raced to the hospital, comforted by a Spanish photojournalist who was holding his hand and trying to keep him awake. Those moments ended a brilliant ten-year career in which Hetherington not only covered such dramatic frontline stories as Liberia and Afghanistan, but also transcended the conventional boundaries of image-making to become one of the most important journalists of his generation.

            <Review>There is plenty of footage of Hetherington. So much, you wonder if he wanted to leave a part of himself behind should the worst come to the worst.</Review>
            <Review>Sebastian Junger, who worked with Hetherington on the celebrated doc Restrepo, paints a biographical profile that often speaks eloquently to the unique nature both of his late friend and of war itself.</Review>
            <Review>Junger ... brings intimacy and personal insight to his film but doesn't give into the temptation to make it a eulogy.</Review>
            <Review>The film is more powerful and haunting thanks to the ample footage incorporated of Hetherington himself, a cheerful soul even when faced with evidence of unimaginable cruelty, such as photographing those blinded during the war in Liberia.</Review>
            <Review>It's easy to see how inspiring he could be as an artist, and how tragically addictive the insanity of combat becomes when the engagement and desire to understand run that deep.</Review>
            <Review>His desire to understand conflict, his gnawing away at the question of what young men get out of violence, sets our own brain whirring.</Review>
            <Review>There is a sense of intimacy and a warm humanity shining in all his work and this is an eloquent, moving tribute ...</Review>
            <Review>With its conventional archive-plus-talking-heads format, this film is less radical than , but Junger articulates a number of subtle and unexpected ideas about Hetherington's work, and about combat reporting in general.</Review>
            <Review>One imagines the charismatic Hetherington, once met, would be unforgettable: Junger's film is a decent, heartfelt tribute.</Review>
            <Review>A stirring lament for the late, great photojournalist and some-time film director who was killed in action.</Review>
            <Review>This is chiefly a celebratory piece ... It is more than that, however, shedding light on what it means to be a journalist in a war zone.</Review>
            <Review>Unsurprisingly, considering the circumstances, this is less a meticulous study of photojournalist's art than an privileged and emotional look at the life of a friend and colleague.</Review>

        <Title>Come Morning</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2012</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>80</Duration>
        <StoryLine>From Fabled Motion Pictures comes a film that critics have called, "beautiful, dark, memorable, thought-provoking, and heart-breaking" (WeGotThisCovered.com). Arkansas, November 1973 - Frank and his grandson D, go on an afternoon hunt. Just before dusk, they wander into the darkening woods to track down their recent kill and, to their horror, find that instead of a deer, they've shot their trespassing neighbor, Marion Mitchell. With a history of land disputes with the Mitchells fresh on Franks' mind, he assures the boy that the only option is to hide the body in the woods. As night draws on, they find themselves only deeper in darkness, and the lines between good and evil are no longer clear. Soon they begin to question if everything will really be okay, come morning. Written, directed, photographed, and edited by first-time director and Arkansas native, Derrick Sims, Come Morning takes you on "an emotional roller coaster" (AUSTIN FUSION) and leaves you with an ending you never saw coming.</StoryLine>

            <Review>In the end, Come Morning succeeds on the strength of a simple narrative with personal dynamic complexities that reveal themselves slowly.</Review>
            <Review>It isn't for everyone, and it certainly won't be considered one of the feel-good movies of the year, but if you appreciate beautiful cinematography and a well-crafted story that still leaves space for thought, Come Morning is an absolute must-see.</Review>
            <Review>...a taut, atmospheric and, given its budgetary restraints, extraordinarily well-realized suspense film set and filmed in southern Arkansas near Kingsland. It's a fine example of what can be accomplished outside a studio paradigm.</Review>

            <Review>You spend a lot of the movie confused, but the great big reveals of its finale don't feel very shocking at all.</Review>
            <Review>There's something welcome about a motion picture that doesn't hand out a dumbed-down resolution in a neatly wrapped package.</Review>
            <Review>Eubank could have a terrific future as a director. As a screenwriter, though, maybe not so much.</Review>
            <Review>There's bravura manipulativeness to The Signal, the stylish, slyly funny question mark of a movie from director and co-writer William Eubank.</Review>
            <Review>The Signal is too ambitious for its own good, but it is still a pleasure to watch.</Review>
            <Review>Eubank's talent is not at all in doubt, and science-fiction mavens who embrace this picture will rightly be excited for whatever he turns to next.</Review>
            <Review>The Signal is clever in its execution of recycled concepts.</Review>
            <Review>Up-and-coming British actress Olivia Cooke and Aussie heart-throb Brenton Thwaites look more confused than the audience in this sci-fi drama.</Review>
            <Review>Part horror, part sci-fi but totally engrossing, William Eubank's The Signal is a small scale production that thrives on some very big ideas.</Review>
            <Review>Adequately creepy, flashy, and/or exciting when the story calls for it, but considerably more interesting for its quieter, craftier moments.</Review>
            <Review>It's a movie of ideas rather than spectacle (Philip K Dick's dreamy electric sheep are inevitably invoked) with some well realised visual effects (a la Ex Machina) giving it genre legs.</Review>
            <Review>While following familiar sci-fi codes, what makes The Signal unique is the way it's transmitted. Because just when you think you've found its wavelength, it switches to another.</Review>

            <Review>The Calling breathes new life into a moribund genre by touching oft-ignored themes and offering a bit of introspection to go along with the obligatory slashed throats and biblical portents.</Review>
            <Review>Almost miraculously finds a way to waste the prodigious talents of Susan Sarandon, Ellen Burstyn, and Donald Sutherland.</Review>
            <Review>What not even Sutherland can do, and which eventually makes you want to lie down on the floor just like Sarandon, is make The Calling convincing or compelling.</Review>
            <Review>Basically this is the story of some major talents having to make do, once again, with a minor film. And that's a crime too, if not quite a sin.</Review>
            <Review>Here's a mystery: what the heck is Susan Sarandon doing north of the border in a low-budget Canadian thriller called The Calling?</Review>
            <Review>"The Calling" aims to unsettle, but when a movie primarily leaves you wanting to learn more about the jurisdictional conflicts of Canadian law, it can't properly be called a thriller.</Review>
            <Review>The outcome is shrug-worthy rather than shocking.</Review>
            <Review>There are pleasures to be found in the crotchety maternal interplay between Sarandon and Ellen Burstyn ...</Review>
            <Review>Working against the sublime, hilly backdrop of Dundas, director Jason Stone keeps his pacing elegant and the atmosphere moody.</Review>
            <Review>The dread barely bobs above sea level, despite efficient performances from Sarandon and the talented, underworked supporting cast.</Review>
            <Review>All in all, a solid if rather daft film.</Review>
            <Review>The Canadian serial-killer-hunt script is less satisfying and heavily signposted throughout, so that even Sarandon's Detective Hazel Micallef seems a bit bored by it and sends out her new deputy (Topher Grace) to do most of the legwork.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Alex Montrieux is lonely. When he meets an American girl online, and the two fall in e-love, it's only natural that he comes for a month-long visit. But minutes after he lands, the young lady changes her mind and dumps him at a rundown suburban motel. Alex is on his own in America. During a night of despair and cheap whiskey, he meets Ron, a good-natured, overweight Burger King junkie who spends most of his waking life in his parents' basement. Ron cheers up Alex with a tour of Chicago-its hot dogs its skyscrapers, its weed, and the bustling life on the street. But later in the week, desperate and alone again, Alex meets a surprisingly complicated girl named Helena that suddenly makes his trip worthwhile. Faced with the prospect of returning home, Alex decides to stay and build his own business in the States-based on a simple premise: offer enough pleasure and you can charge any price. Along with Ron and Helena, Alex partners with Bob, Ron's best friend, a dim witted ex-convict with political aspirations, and Reza, an Iranian entrepreneur who owns a small pizza shop. The business explodes and Alex quickly finds himself something of an underground kingpin, despite being increasingly conflicted between the two sides of his relationship with Helena, his girlfriend and employee. When Bob's greed and jealousy raise the stakes to a dangerous level, Alex is faced with a choice between a better self and his high rolling life.</StoryLine>

        <ReleaseDate/>
        <Duration>99</Duration>
        <StoryLine>On May 17, 1968, nine Catholic activists entered a Selective Service office in suburban Catonsville, Maryland, dragged stacks of Draft Board records out into the parking lot, and set them on fire with homemade napalm. They then prayed, and waited to be arrested. In doing so, they kindled a wave of similar protests against the Vietnam War across the country that swept up dozens of participants and inspired thousands, and then millions. HIT &amp; STAY, a new documentary film by Joe Tropea and Skizz Cyzyk tells the story of the Nine and those who joined them in protesting the war. The Catonsville Nine action had been preceded by a quartet of activists--including Catonsville Nine participant, Father Philip Berrigan--splashing blood on draft files in nearby Baltimore. But it was Catonsville that galvanized the nonviolent antiwar resistance away from protest marches and toward direct actions by ordinary citizens against draft boards. This new form of protest quickly spread to similar actions in Washington, D.C., New York, Milwaukee, and all across the country, drawing the attention of the Federal Bureau of Investigation as well as the increasingly antiwar American public. Through interviews with many of the participants (as well as observers ranging from linguist political critic Noam Chomsky to historian Howard Zinn), HIT &amp; STAY explores the early actions, the activists going to prison or going underground, the FBI's pushback against the movement, the escalating scale and stakes, and the ultimate victory of the protesters in the trial of the Camden 28.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Despite a finely wrought lead performance by Dakota Fanning, the drama feels more like the stuff of a mild - and dated - YA novel than an involving exploration of female experience.</Review>
            <Review>One insurmountable problem is that the stars, especially Ms. Olsen, 25, are too old for their roles. Another is that the movie has more characters than it can begin to accommodate in 91 minutes.</Review>
            <Review>Disappointingly, Foner's young heroines are defined primarily by their reactions to other people. It's a great credit to Olsen and, especially, Fanning that they manage to make these characters vibrant and sympathetic anyway.</Review>
            <Review>A drama that feels like an old person's idea of what young people are like.</Review>
            <Review>We should forget the contrivances because we're wrapped up in how the girls act during the aftermath, but we aren't given that privilege.</Review>
            <Review>"Very Good Girls" is far from a perfect movie, but I enjoyed its spirit and atmosphere, even as I objected to some of the key elements.</Review>
            <Review>Youthful cliches trump insight in Very Good Girls.</Review>
            <Review>Appreciably different and well acted throughout, and sincerely engaging in patches... [but] ultimately succumbs to sigh-inducing artificiality.</Review>
            <Review>The film treats a complicated experience with painstaking simplicity.</Review>
            <Review>Bland, brooding coming-of-age drama wastes talented cast.</Review>

        <Title>The Last of the Unjust</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>220</Duration>
        <StoryLine>1975. In Rome, Claude Lanzmann filmed a series of interviews with Benjamin Murmelstein, the last President of the Jewish Council in the Theresienstadt ghetto in Czechoslovakia, the only "Elder of the Jews"* not to have been killed during the war. A rabbi in Vienna, following the annexation of Austria by Germany in 1938, Murmelstein fought bitterly with Adolf Eichmann, week after week for seven years, managing to help around 121,000 Jews leave the country, and preventing the liquidation of the ghetto. 2012. Claude Lanzmann, at 87 - without masking anything of the passage of time on men, but showing the incredible permanence of the locations involved -exhumes these interviews shot in Rome, returning to Theresienstadt, the town "given to the Jews by Hitler", a so-&amp;#8208;called model ghetto, but a ghetto of deceit chosen by Adolf Eichmann to dupe the world. We discover the extraordinary personality of Benjamin Murmelstein: a man blessed with a dazzling intelligence and a true courage, which, along with an unrivaled memory, makes him a wonderfully wry, sardonic and authentic storyteller. Through these three periods, from Nisko in Poland to Theresienstadt, and from Vienna to Rome, the film provides an unprecedented insight into the genesis of the Final Solution. It reveals the true face of Eichmann, and exposes without artifice the savage contradictions of the Jewish Councils. (c) Cohen</StoryLine>

            <Review>The best one can say for this troubling, if intermittently fascinating, mess is that it succeeds in raising questions, moral as well as aesthetic, that it cannot answer.</Review>
            <Review>Murmelstein addresses Lanzmann's skepticism and questions with earnestness, passion and -- as if the rest of it wasn't troubling enough -- what seems like total recall.</Review>
            <Review>Lanzmann organizes the material achronologically, presenting Murmelstein's narrative out of order and intercutting it with footage of Theresienstadt shot in 2012; this complex structure evokes a sense of moral vertigo that's nearly impossible to shake.</Review>
            <Review>Those who think this is a black-and-white issue will be surprised, as Lanzmann himself appears to have been, by what is said here.</Review>
            <Review>The Last of the Unjust has a vivid immediacy.</Review>
            <Review>[Lanzmann is] the kind of witness the Holocaust needs: The witness who refuses to leave the stand until the full story is told.</Review>
            <Review>To some degree, the force of The Last of the Unjust is delivered in spite of Lanzmann's laxness as a filmmaker.</Review>
            <Review>At three and a half hours, this documentary sometimes feels both overlong and far too detailed, but filmmaker Claude Lanzmann knows that this material is vitally important, and by putting it all out there he challenges the viewer to understand the truth.</Review>
            <Review>Each viewer will judge its truth for themselves, but the director's compassionately unsentimental acceptance is clear and profound.</Review>
            <Review>This is a complex and very moving documentary.</Review>
            <Review>The Last of the Unjust is cinema at its very best.</Review>
            <Review>Lanzmann draws on unused footage of a 1975 interview in Rome with Viennese rabbi Benjamin Murmelstein to assess his role as the sole surviving member of the Jewish Council installed by the Nazis to help run the Theresienstadt ghetto camp.</Review>

            <Review>One of the best family films to come down the pike this year, and not just because this year has also brought us The Nut Job and Legends of Oz: Dorothy's Return.</Review>
            <Review>Viewers unencumbered by nostalgia will probably see this zippy, occasionally funny movie as no more frantic or pop-culture-addled than the average multiplex fodder.</Review>
            <Review>The 6-year-old I watched it with summed it up perfectly: "It starts out fun but then it's kinda sad and scary. And sorta boring, too."</Review>
            <Review>Since Simon Cowell and his talent shows are already over-exposed on TV, it's a real shame that Postman Pat's producers have rubber-stamped such a contrived storyline at the expense of originality.</Review>

            <Review>Simply adorable...Plenty of digs at celebrity culture (including great use of Peter Gabriel's Big Time), TV and the film itself spice up a sweet, message-strong story, directed by American Mike Disa (Hookwinked).</Review>
            <Review>As children's entertainment, [it] is pretty wretched. Character designs are rudimentary, plot points are set up and never paid off, and halfway through the closing musical number the animators appear to forget that Pat is meant to be moving his lips.</Review>
            <Review>There's a TV talent quest, an ambitious efficiency expert, an army of postman robots and an endearing protagonist worth rooting for. It's a colourful adventure filled with charm and humour that the whole family will love</Review>
            <Review>Cute British adventure should make little ones laugh.</Review>
            <Review>The script is a chaotic morass of mixed intentions, often forsaking what would really appeal to a young child in favor of cynical attempts to keep their parents awake.</Review>
            <Review>Postman Pat - lovably voiced by Stephen Mangan - is catnip to nippers, who'll love the songs (Ronan Keating takes over to voice those), fear the scary robot cats and cheer the ever-cheery mailman on his way.</Review>

            <Review>Ida is not only an evocation of early '60s Poland, the period of Pawlikowski's childhood, but a film that gives the illusion that it could have been made then.</Review>
            <Review>Now that Paweł Pawlikowski's haunting Polish film has been nominated for a foreign-language Oscar, Ida is back in the conversation. Let yourself be enveloped by a modern cinema classic.</Review>
            <Review>Nestled within its sins-of-the-elders narrative is a faintly charming cross-generational bonding picture, pairing a worldly cynic with a young girl taking her last gasp of secular air before giving her life to the Lord.</Review>

            <Review>Don't adjust your set: the film is (strikingly) photographed in Bergman-esque shades of gray-and-white.</Review>
            <Review>Consider "Ida" the first offering in a summer celebrating Polish cinema and the latest masterpiece in a powerful tradition.</Review>

Without any friends to speak of and alienated from her hoochie mama coworkers at a crummy Brooklyn supermarket, Mona maintains a strangely close relationship with her campy, recovering alcoholic mother May (Dana Eskelson). Mona's sister Jordan (Molly Plunk) is an unemployable party girl, estranged from May and making life hell for her increasingly fed up girlfriend Sylve (Keisha Zollar). In the final days of her pregnancy, Mona draws her mother, sister, and anybody who happens to get caught in her wake into her hectic life as she drifts further from reality.

            <Review>Director David Michod's follow-up to his acclaimed debut, Animal Kingdom, is effective in an elemental way.</Review>
            <Review>Like many a late 21st century Western -- regardless of the land of its origins -- The Rover asks what happens on the downslope of Manifest Destiny? As hot, parched and heated as the atmosphere is, the answers are chilling.</Review>
            <Review>The Rover is so intentionally vague and shapeless, it doesn't leave much of an imprint other than Pattinson's odd, melancholy performance.</Review>
            <Review>While Michôd may not achieve that transcendental awakening in the vagabonds of this god-forsaken country, they've braved through enough hellfire for us to have mercy, and to care about them.</Review>
            <Review>Michôd has created a frighteningly realistic apocalyptic western that's entirely his own.</Review>
            <Review>Poor plot aside, it boasts two stellar performances.</Review>
            <Review>The final scene is a clear picture of how regardless of the lawless land, principles and honor means everything.</Review>
            <Review>The atmosphere usually gets airless as the action doesn't rove so much as drift and slow-zoom from moody moment to straggly episode. Any sharp-eyed insights into these godforsaken characters or their fallen society are few and far-between.</Review>

        <Title>Taras Bulba</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 1962</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>122</Duration>
        <StoryLine>The spectacular hordes of Cossack horsemen flying across the steppes to do battle with first one enemy and then another are the highlights of this otherwise thinly scripted costume drama set in the 16th century in the Ukraine. After the Cossack leader Taras Bulba (Yul Brynner) makes a pact with the Poles to join forces against the Turks and drive them from the European steppes, victory brings betrayal as the Poles then turn on their ally and force the Cossacks into the hills. From there, Taras Bulba decides that one of his sons, Andrei (Tony Curtis), will be sent to Polish schools to better learn the nature of their enemy. While away from home and hearth, the adult Andrei falls in love with a Polish noblewoman, Natalia (Christine Kaufmann, who would become the second Mrs. Curtis). As time progresses, the tensions between father and son, loyalty and love, ethnic identity and assimilation steadily increase until they end in tragedy. Taras Bulba was nominated for a 1963 Academy Award for "Best Music", scored by Franz Waxman. ~ Eleanor Mannikka, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <Title>The Young Savages</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 1961</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>110</Duration>
        <StoryLine>The Young Savages is what used to be called a "thinking man's picture" about a potentially lurid subject: urban juvenile delinquency. A blind Puerto Rican boy is knifed to death in Spanish Harlem, and three teenage gang members are accused of the crime. Politically ambitious assistant DA Burt Lancaster initially presses for the conviction of all three boys. But as he gets deeper into the case, he realizes that what appears cut-and-dried on the surface is tortuously complex: for starters, the murder victim was hardly the paragon of virtue that the prosecution claims. Despite pressure from his superiors and from members of the accused boys' gang (who at one point threaten Lancaster's wife Dina Merrill with a switchblade,) Lancaster nonetheless sees to it that justice is properly administered. The defendants are portrayed with varying degrees of Brando/Dean "method" by John Davis Chandler, Neil Nephew and Stanley Kristien; more believable, less affected performances are rendered by Shelley Winters, Pilar Seurat and Telly Savalas. Filmed on location in New York, The Young Savages was based on the Evan Hunter novel A Matter of Conviction. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <ReleaseDate> 1958</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>93</Duration>
        <StoryLine>The contrasting acting styles of Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster serve to increase the already high tension level of the WW2 drama Run Silent, Run Deep. Gable plays submarine commander "Rich" Richardson, who assumes command of the USS Nerka. Because his previous sub was sunk by the Japanese under highly suspect circumstances, Richardson inspires nothing but animosity from his new crew. Particularly hostile is executive officer Lt. Jim Bledsoe (Burt Lancaster), who'd assumed that he was next in line to command the Nerka. Obsessed with tracking down the Japanese destroyer that sank his old sub, Richardson drives his crew mercilessly, and even disobeys direct orders from his own higher-ups. The Nerka manages to blast the Japanese vessel out of the waters, but in so doing the sub is placed in dire peril in enemy waters. In his desperate efforts to save the Nerka, Richardson at long last wins the respect of Bledsoe and the rest of the crew. Featured in the cast of Run Silent, Run Deep are Burt Lancaster's old circus partner Nick Cravat, and, in his unbilled movie debut, Don Rickles. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>Most people don't know that 425,000 German soldiers were brought to U.S. prisoner of war camps during W.W.II. One of them was Fort McCoy.... Eric Stoltz (Pulp Fiction) gives one of his most powerful performances as Frank Stirn, who moves with his family to become a barber for the American Army and POW camp at Fort McCoy, Wisconsin, in the summer of 1944. Embittered that he cannot fight, Frank must take a stand when a Nazi SS Officer threatens his wife (Kate Connor, playing her real-life grandmother). Her Catholic sister (Lyndsy Fonseca, Kick-Ass) falls for a Jewish soldier (Andy Hirsch, The Chicago 8) haunted by the battle of Monte Cassino and the death of his best friend (Matthew Lawrence, Mrs. Doubtfire). Camryn Manheim (Happiness) is their audacious friend who encourages the couple, while Seymour Cassel (Rushmore) is the priest who cannot. Frank's daughter befriends a German prisoner boy during this magical summer, but war still finds its victims even thousands of miles from the battlefields. (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>The Fault In Our Stars could indeed become this generation's Love Story -- mildly implausible, but genuinely moving.</Review>
            <Review>"The Fault in Our Stars" is unabashed in its efforts to make you well up, but the tears come from a real place.</Review>
            <Review>The film has enough charm and humor to keep it appealing to a wide audience, and dumbing things down doesn't feel particularly smart or canny, and proves to be a minor distraction to an otherwise majorly entertaining feature.</Review>
            <Review>Far from the shameless emotional pummeling it might have been, this adaptation of John Green's cherished YA cancer drama finds a conduit to earned, understated tears -- a tricky accomplishment given the material.</Review>
            <Review>"The Fault in Our Stars" may not show the true messiness of cancer, but it does grapple with death and the ability to survive great loss. Maybe that's enough truth for one movie.</Review>
            <Review>Led by the unforgettable work from a young actress who's among the best of her generation, "The Fault in Our Stars" is a lovely work.</Review>
            <Review>Green took the familiar and maudlin and transformed them into something knowing, poignant and practically sensitive.</Review>
            <Review>"The Fault In Our Stars" is a top-tier tearjerker and a veritable shoo-in for all future "movies that will make you bawl" lists.</Review>
            <Review>Boone's appropriately light touch emphasises the underlying literary material, foregrounding the performances with occasional underplayed visual humour and reserving stylistic nuance.</Review>
            <Review>Although certain plot points skirt dangerously close to clichés that more cynical viewers will have been dreading, somehow they manage to resolve plausibly.</Review>
            <Review>The Fault in the Stars is what my late mother's generation used to call a three-handkerchief</Review>
            <Review>It's an old-school weepie, all right, and the usual weepers will weep loudly.</Review>

            <Review>The crowded compositions convey a sense of life in the dense Asian city-state, but also the intimacy of this semi-autobiographical story.</Review>
            <Review>Anthony Chen, a Singaporean writer-director with a half-dozen shorts to his credit, makes his feature debut with this vividly characterized domestic drama.</Review>
            <Review>Characters who may seem hopeless begin to suggest a vulnerable side, and none truly deserve the situations that afflict them.</Review>
            <Review>"Ilo Ilo" is writer-director Anthony Chen's first film, but breathtaking intimacy in storytelling is already second nature to him.</Review>
            <Review>The acting is terrific, as is the attention to detail.</Review>
            <Review>Carefully crafted and understated.</Review>
            <Review>All four of the lead actors, especially Yeo and Koh, deliver naturalistic performances of a standard that will set the benchmark for years to come.</Review>
            <Review>It's diverting and entertaining, but its drama is so understated that fails to make a lasting impression.</Review>
            <Review>Nobody in Jiale's extended family is happy for long but neither are they miserable. The film achieves a quietly impressive balance as human behaviour swings from serious to funny and back again.</Review>
            <Review>Succinct, handheld camerawork and deft performances amplify the drama's emotional clout.</Review>
            <Review>Ilo Ilo is an affectionate and poignant - if slight - slice of family life.</Review>

            <Review>Quietly unnerving.</Review>
            <Review>This curious, surprisingly safe melodrama fictionalises the postwar life of brutal Nazi surgeon Josef Mengele.</Review>
            <Review>Puenzo masterfully balances the film's thriller edge with disturbing details about Mengele's obsession with genetic experimentation, as well as the community of German expatriates in Argentina helping old Nazis elude arrest.</Review>
            <Review>Puenzo has a knack for plumbing the heads and hearts of teenage girls. The director coaxes a mesmerizing, unmannered performance out of Bado, who is making her feature-film debut.</Review>
            <Review>The German Doctor is skillfully made and acted, but without any sense of spontaneity or surprise - qualities required for any decent thriller.</Review>
            <Review>A thriller with a historical basis, 'The German Doctor' is a somewhat fictionalized glimpse at a ghastly real-life villain.</Review>
            <Review>The picture is beautifully shot and the serenity of the Argentine mountain landscape works as an effective contradiction to the deranged, demented narrative at hand.</Review>
            <Review>Lucia Puenzo's queasy thriller builds up into a quietly effective monster movie.</Review>
            <Review>It is the dichotomy of the beauty of the setting with Mengele's monstrous deeds that make "The German Doctor" so unnerving.</Review>
            <Review>What the movie lacks in chills and thrills is made up for by the methodical unraveling of the truth.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>89</Duration>
        <StoryLine>"Outstanding" - Leonard Maltin; Combining over 240 interviews, extensive archival footage, animated stills &amp; documents with a moving original score, Director Tom Donahue has meticulously crafted the untold tale of the Hollywood casting director. CASTING BY is a celebration of the profession, highlighting its previously unsung role in film history while also serving as an elegy to the lost era of the New Hollywood. The documentary focuses on pioneer Marion Dougherty, an iconoclast whose exquisite taste, tenacity and gut instincts brought a new kind of actor to the screen that would mark the end of the old studio system and help to usher in this revolutionary new period. The film skillfully draws a line through the last half century to show us the profession's evolution from studio system type-casting to the rise of large ensemble films populated with unique and diverse casts. The interviewees are a Who's Who of Hollywood legends including Martin Scorsese, Woody Allen, Clint Eastwood, Glenn Close, Robert Duvall, Jeff Bridges, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Diane Lane, Jon Voight, Danny Glover, Bette Midler, John Travolta and countless others.

            <Review>A look into one of the most invisible, and crucial, of cinematic disciplines.</Review>
            <Review>While Dougherty clearly had an almost eerie sense of how a particular actor might inhabit a part, this film also shows that she may have single-handedly created a filmmaking craft and then made it indispensable.</Review>
            <Review>Proves a vivid reminder of the hand-in-glove importance of right actor/right role - and the indispensability of those casting mavens who helped make movie history. Good stuff.</Review>
            <Review>Something of an elegy for a lost era, when talent, even at its rawest, stood far above prettiness as the primary reason for getting the part.</Review>

            <Review>Casting By is perhaps an esoteric film, made by a film buff for film buffs, but that's no slight against it</Review>
            <Review>Donahue makes a compelling case that publicly unsung hero Dougherty (and L.A. counterpart Lynn Stalmaster) had a profound influence on the industry.</Review>
            <Review>Delicious insider tales of the making of some of your favorite films enrich this wonderfully informative and entertaining doc about casting directors.</Review>
            <Review>In his impressively researched film, Donahue makes it clear why and how Dougherty helped define her profession.</Review>
            <Review>Informative and enormously entertaining in equal measure, Casting By throws a warm, deserving spotlight on casting directors, charting the overlooked profession's inception and growth.</Review>
            <Review>Welcome to the world of the casting director, a world that flourished at its peak from the middle to the end of the last century. And meet its high priestess: Marion Dougherty.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>88</Duration>
        <StoryLine>BURT'S BUZZ takes an intimate look at the world of Burt Shavitz, the face and co-founder of Burt's Bees, exploring his fascinating and unique life. Wise and wry, ornery and opinionated, the reclusive Shavitz is committed to living off the land and keeping true to his humble beginnings despite his celebrity status. The film chronicles Burt's life as a photographer, beekeeper, and brand spokesman, following his complicated relationship with the company, his fans, and the world around him. Exposing the collision between business and personal values, "Burt's Buzz" is a compelling and fascinating portrait of this highly idiosyncratic pioneer, and a revealing study of what it means to be a living icon.

            <Review>Shavitz is undoubtedly an intriguing fellow, but "Burt's Buzz" never quite finds what makes him tick.</Review>
            <Review>Shapiro (How to Start Your Own Country) lets the story play out in a meandering fashion that echoes Shavitz's approach to life.</Review>

            <Review>A certain hirsute fellow in an engineer's cap, the one whose enigmatic kisser graces the Burt's Bees logo, is, it turns out, the real deal. And he's more of a character than any marketing guru could invent.</Review>

            <Review>Burt's not your typical entrepreneur. He's not your typical anything.</Review>
            <Review>If there was a film school class about burying the lede, it would be difficult to think of a more fitting example than this aimless doc, which gets to its most essential questions only an hour into its running time or leaves them entirely unasked.</Review>
            <Review>A documentary about a Maine recluse who at 76 years of age makes public appearances as the icon of the Burt's Bees brand.</Review>
            <Review>Laconically recognizes his deal to be a symbol as latest reinvention of himself. Equally charming and annoying, his quirkiness and stubbornness play to the company's benefit.</Review>

The highly anticipated follow-up to the award-winning Ford Brothers' critically acclaimed zombie road movie The Dead sees the cult franchise move to the hustle and bustle of India as the devastating outbreak takes hold. Set against the spectacular vistas and stunning scenery of Rajasthan, known as The Land of the Kings and one of the world's first and oldest civilizations, THE DEAD 2: INDIA puts the Ford Brothers' unique apocalyptic vision on a far bigger canvas in terms of breathtaking scope, thrilling action, death-defying stunts, emotional resonance and spine-tingling fright.

        <StoryLine>When the zombie plague hits India, an American turbine engineer embarks on a terrifying 300 mile journey to save his girlfriend and their unborn child on the outskirts of the Mumbai slums. It all started with a single infected worker from Somalia. From the moment he stepped onto the docks, the fate of the entire country was sealed. Now, in one of the most populated countries on the planet, there is no escaping the curse of the living dead. Meanwhile, in the serine countryside, Nicholas Burton (Joseph Millson) works to build a remote wind farm. Upon receiving a panicked call from his girlfriend Ishani (Meenu Mishra) in Mumbai, Nicholas is shocked to learn that she is pregnant, and that the city has been overrun by flesh eaters. Now, in order to reach her in time to catch the last flight out of the country, Nicholas must fight his way across the country with few weapons, and only a street-smart youth named Javed (Anand Goyal) to guide him. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>Every time Edwards' Godzilla rears up, you stiffen with excitement. Every time he roars, Edwards wants you to feel it and wince.</Review>
            <Review>This is what you get, San Francisco, with all your douchey, flashy, dot-com money: You get stomped on by Godzilla.</Review>
            <Review>Godzilla handles everything the military hurls at him: ships, guns, planes, rockets, even a squadron of HALO paratroopers. The only thing that can cut him down to size is being relegated to a supporting role in his very own movie.</Review>
            <Review>The beasts just want to have fun, but the gravest letdown in Edwards's film is that, most of the time, he fends off the chance to have fun himself.</Review>
            <Review>We're here to see the film's leading lizard, who is pretty gorgeously realized by an army of digitizers, even if he seems just a bit-player in his own movie for the first hour or so.</Review>
            <Review>The first truly joyous popcorn action movie of the season.</Review>
            <Review>Big lizard, big budget, big fun.</Review>
            <Review>'Godzilla' doesn't feel cynical; there's a sense of joy to the picture, of honest-to-God fun, which separates it from many of its summer movie brethren.</Review>
            <Review>Olive Oyl once sang a love song about Bluto. The refrain was, 'He's... laaaarge.' And there you have Godzilla in a nutshell. He's large, and the movie's largely a crashing bore.</Review>
            <Review>In a studio system that so heavily relies on playing all their cards at once, Edwards' restraint is half the fun -- the other half being the fully-satisfying climax.</Review>
            <Review>"Godzilla" circa 2014 towers over the majority of its monster movie brethren.</Review>

            <Review>Purporting to be a horror film that foregoes scares of any kind for blood-drenched gore and puerile comedy, it's the reason why so many feel that the horror genre is on a slippery slope.</Review>

        <Title>Evergreen: The Road to Legalization in Washington</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>86</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Tracking the behind-the-scenes efforts of both the pro- and anti-initiative groups, the film serves as a case study for other states in determining how to reform their own drug policies, and examines the civic, economic and human impact of marijuana legalization. Against the backdrop of the 40-year-old 'War on Drugs', the state of Washington becomes a key battleground in the fight for cannabis prohibition reform. A growing medical pot industry paves the way for cultural change, while an unprecedented team of political superstars and local celebrities put forth a plan, known as Initiative 502, that they hope will balance the delicate politics of the region and stand a chance to pass in the November elections.

        <Duration>116</Duration>
        <StoryLine>This rock and roll drama stars, James Brolin, Carlos Bernard, Tessie Santiago, The Marshall Tucker Band, Kurtis Blow, Patty Smyth and the rock and roll sensation from South Africa that lit up the screen on Rockstar Supernova, Dilana. When rock star sensation, Scottie B., falls prey to the demons of fame, she escapes the music scene only to find herself face to face with her destiny once again and even greater challenges when she inherits a little bar that was once owned by a woman with the same spirit and voice of an angel. This exciting rock and roll adventure shot was in the desert of California and the low country of South Carolina. Angel Camouflaged is the journey of SCOTTIE, a rock and roll singer whose struggle with substance abuse causes her music career to implode. Scottie bails on her manager/brother, MORGAN, to hide out in the Mojave Desert. Her peaceful new life is disturbed when Morgan calls and tells her that they inherited a bar in far-off South Carolina. Scottie is hesitant to take Morgan up on the offer, but tragedy once again plays his heartless hand and changes Scottie's mind and circumstances. Scottie hits the road with nothing but her tears and her guitar. When she finally sees the bar, she's horrified, the place is completely in shambles. Scottie and Morgan find themselves in a hostile world of raging motorcycle clubs, gun toting gang bangers, a satanic flesh merchant and a deadly neighbor who is hell bent on sabotaging their efforts to survive. Drowning in a sea of despair, Scottie learns from her departed aunt to see her true spirit and rise above her tribulations and fight the demons bent on her destruction. This film is rock and roll music, it's old west-style bar fights with a little Southern Mysticism mixed in. It's a wild, emotional adventure about the will of a brother and sister who find the strength to overcome seemingly insurmountable odds.</StoryLine>

            <Review>With its clunky chalkboard chapters and a parade of static talking heads too often repeating the filmmaker's underlying theme of political corruption and union myopia, it's a C theatrical experience. Maybe a C+ for right intentions.</Review>
            <Review>The film -- for which Bowdon directed, wrote, narrated, produced, operated a camera, composed music and sang -- spends a little too much time on static shots of flickering computer screens filled with gray text, and it has the look of cheap video.</Review>
            <Review>There are plenty of legitimate grievances here, but like Michael Moore at his pushiest, Bowdon often undermines his own argument with obvious factual cherry-picking.</Review>
            <Review>Bowdon makes an insufferable first impression, and his movie often looks as if it were shot with a camera-phone (for good measure, he includes actual camera-phone footage, which admittedly looks worse than his).</Review>
            <Review>Bowdon makes a compelling argument against the defensive maneuvers of teachers' unions and in favor of vouchers and charter schools, but his documentary is no exercise in free-market cant.</Review>
            <Review>Watching this film, you'd think that most public schools were Mafia-run slaughterhouses and most charter schools were urban academies with high success rates. Bowdon barely mentions the religiosity and profit motive behind some charter schools.</Review>
            <Review>But this amateurish, ultimately poorly argued documentary isn't likely to convert many of those on the fence on this issue.</Review>
            <Review>In The Cartel, New Jersey public schools are an example of what's going wrong in U.S. school systems generally, despite a "spending explosion."</Review>
            <Review>...you will more likely find yourself annoyed by this documentary's similarity to a series of television segments pasted together and stretched out to 90 minutes...</Review>
            <Review>You may not agree with the solutions offered in The Cartel but it's impossible not to be outraged at the corruption on display.</Review>
            <Review>Anyone who gets a thrill out of town meetings may salivate at what Bowdon throws at viewers, which is all statistics and wonkery.</Review>
            <Review>If it played on New Jersey TV, I bet The Cartel would open some eyes, but as Bowdon tries to parlay a very local issue into a nationally released movie, it's more likely to close them.</Review>

        <Title>Teen Wolf</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 1985</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>92</Duration>
        <StoryLine>After sitting on the shelf for some time, Teen Wolf was released on the heels of the hugely successful Back to the Future in an attempt to cash in on the huge popularity of star Michael J. Fox. Teen Wolf chronicles the plight of Fox as a small-town nerd who can't seem to score a basket on the court or a point with his dream girl. Things change, however, once he discovers his family's hereditary secret, lycanthrope. As he begins to look hairier and hairier, his team begins to win basketball games and his dream girl begins to show interest in his unusual talent. His story does not progress without complications, however. His best friend, an opportunistic weasel, begins to exploit him beyond his limits of toleration, and his dream girl is captive to the requisite bully boyfriend, who, of course, captains the arch-rival basketball team. And then, to top it all off, Fox's other best friend is in love with him. Unbelievably, this film was a box-office success and eventually inspired an even worse sequel, Teen Wolf Too, several years later -- a film which Fox wisely declined.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Rather than a wolf in sheep's clothing, Teen Wolf is basically a standard 80s teen flick in werewolf's clothing.</Review>
            <Review>It's often ridiculous, and filled with '80s cheese, but Teen Wolf does harbor some poignant coming-of-age metaphors and decent helping of intentional, and unintentional, comedy.</Review>
            <Review>Despite the inexcusable lack of a DeLorean, Teen Wolf is a modest, digestible comedy, guided by a perfectly itchy Fox performance as the titular beast.</Review>

            <Review>A fair amount of the film leaves you wondering about the categorizations it's courted as a dark comedy. If the tag legitimately applies, then it takes Slattery a while to find his footing, if he ever really does.</Review>

        <Duration>97</Duration>
        <StoryLine>The Hornet's Nest is a groundbreaking and immersive feature film, using unprecedented real footage to tell the story of an elite group of U.S. troops sent on a dangerous mission deep inside one of Afghanistan's most hostile valleys. The film culminates with what was planned as a single day strike turning into nine intense days of harrowing combat against an invisible, hostile enemy in the country's complex terrain where no foreign troops have ever dared to go before. Two embedded journalists, a father and son, bravely followed the troops through the fiercest and most blood-soaked battlegrounds of the conflict. What resulted is an intensely raw feature film experience that will give audiences a deeply emotional and authentic view of the heroism at the center of this gripping story. (c) Freestyle</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>KORENGAL picks up where RESTREPO left off: the same valley, same men, but a very different look at the experience of war. KORENGAL not only shows what war looks like, but how war works and what it means to the young men who fight it. While one soldier cheers when he kills the enemy, another asks if God will ever forgive him for the killing he has done. As one soldier grieves the loss of a friend, another explains why he misses the war now that his deployment has ended, and admits he would go back to the front line in a heartbeat. Every bit as intense and affecting as RESTREPO, KORENGAL gives audiences a front row view into the world of combat. (C) Saboteur Media</StoryLine>

            <Review>Most fascinating is the seemingly unanimous feeling that while deployment in Korengal was hard and heartbreaking, these veterans would do it all again just to stay together, to remain brothers who mutually understand something no on else will ever know.</Review>
            <Review>Not quite a coda to Sebastian Junger's and Tim Heatherington's...Restrepo - more of a commentary track, or a series of annotations.</Review>
            <Review>In a series of expertly edited interviews conducted with infantrymen on their way home after a year in the Korengal Valley, Junger exposes us to the war's psychological toll.</Review>
            <Review>"Restrepo" felt like the story of how boys become men. "Korengal" feels like the story of how strangers become family.</Review>
            <Review>Those of us who haven't served on active duty can't know what it's like. Taken together, "Restrepo" and "Korengal" brings us about as close to the experience as we can, or would want, to get.</Review>
            <Review>The film is a tribute to the courage, tenacity and sorrow of the men with their boots on the ground in a place very far away.</Review>
            <Review>While much insights are the same. . .now grudging honesty from African-American soldiers on differences [and] barely disguised cultural condescension to native Pashtuns.</Review>
            <Review>If the first film was made more for civilians who have never experienced war, the second seems to be aimed at veterans who want to reflect on their experiences.</Review>
            <Review>Remarkably frank, Korengal espouses no one clear sentiment towards war.</Review>
            <Review>Reminds us that Americans not very different than ourselves took the military as a job of work.</Review>
            <Review>"Korengal" revisits some of the men featured in the original, talking to them stateside about their experiences. They make poignant if not unprecedented insights into the warrior code, and into the complicated lives of stateside veterans.</Review>
            <Review>"Korengal" doesn't have the immediacy of "Restrepo," but it's frequently affecting, as well as being a remembrance of just how young the people are we send into harm's way.</Review>

            <Review>Viewing now in the clear light of a post-DADT world and the grand-standing dialogue of [Director] Greer and co-writer Helene Kvale come off as weightless, drooping under the clichés and perceived inherent power of its story...</Review>
            <Review>Emotionally gripping and features some stunning shots of Navy jets in action.</Review>
            <Review>Burning Blue has lots of scenes where its male leads gaze longingly at each other, which is meant to be melancholy and erotic, but unfortunately skirts close to parody.</Review>
            <Review>This stiff saga of gays in the military, with its manly men being manly together, evokes that tale of repression Brokeback Mountain, while somehow being much less homoerotic than Top Gun.</Review>

            <Review>Mr. Nooshin stirs a mystery that's light on special effects and bravely uncomplicated.</Review>
            <Review>Although the film, Nooshin's first feature, takes a while to become fully propulsive, it eventually puts forth an effective series of red herrings, close calls and clock-ticking action scenes.</Review>
            <Review>Scott's excellent turn in this gripping indie thriller proves he can handle action roles.</Review>
            <Review>Omid Nooshin's sturdy runaway-train thriller chugs up a decent amount of suspense.</Review>
            <Review>While Last Passenger is a campy B-movie, it possesses greater aesthetic aspirations, and the film's stylistic ambition is ultimately what makes it an entertaining ride.</Review>
            <Review>Last Passenger is a good antithesis to the overloaded and cluttered action Hollywood seems to love nowadays.</Review>
            <Review>While Last Passenger is in the same vein as films such as Unstoppable, Speed, Joy Ride, and Premium Rush, it lacks a proper resolution and its empty thrills don't make up for its inadequate amount of substance.</Review>
            <Review>Altogether, this is a brilliantly done entry in the non-blockbuster suspense genre -- of which we haven't had enough lately.</Review>
            <Review>A runaway-train action thriller that coasts along serviceably for a bit before entering Boredom Station, this British-produced rip-off of Speed lacks compelling characterizations.</Review>
            <Review>Like so many late-night journeys, Last Passenger starts out full of promise, but only stops at places we've already been.</Review>
            <Review>Intelligent and strongly acted, Last Passenger is a white-knuckle thrill ride that, despite its small budget, is capable of going toe-to-toe with the best thrillers coming out of Hollywood today</Review>

            <Review>What Marina sees in Borgman is one of the countless implausibilities that make the film more annoying than disturbing.</Review>
            <Review>The black humour and perversity can occasionally startle, but the film takes far too much sadistic delight in punishing these entitled dopes.</Review>
            <Review>A creepily comical story about an insistent vagrant turned insidious home occupier.</Review>
            <Review>It's the hypnotic little thriller's disturbing twists that make it such a singular -- and singularly weird -- experience.</Review>
            <Review>The degree of ambiguity involved in this scenario imbues each new twist with claustrophobia and dread.</Review>
            <Review>Though it's too enigmatic for its own good and often feels like it's being made up as it goes, the Dutch import "Borgman" holds interest if only to see what might possibly happen next.</Review>
            <Review>Clearly allegorical, but what exactly it speaks to (some personal version of familial unrest, no doubt) is probably different for everyone. Regardless, it's a fascinating film with darkly comic moments that bears repeated viewings.</Review>
            <Review>Beautifully filmed and intellectually stimulating, Borgman is one of the most unique and exhilarating films of 2014 despite its lack of resolution and clarification.</Review>
            <Review>Funny Games, indeed. Creepy, spooky and nightmarish.</Review>
            <Review>Horror is far more unsettling when it's surrounded by teak furniture.</Review>
            <Review>Borgman falls somewhere between Boudu and Rasputin in the canon of family interlopers, an instinctual manipulator who can pinpoint vulnerability with laser precision.</Review>
            <Review>It's a sidelong coming-of-age that feels as though it skims the bittersweetness of its ending, but Lucky Them cares more about the trip than the destination.</Review>

        <StoryLine>This is a feature length documentary filmed between 2009-2012 in the USA and in Copenhagen. Us and the Game Industry explores computer game development. A developer cluster was invited to contribute to discussion on design outcomes with this new form. Developers share their motivation, design process, focus and execution of game ideas. They include: Jason Rohrer, Alexander Bruce, Die Gute Fabrik, Zack Gage and programmers and designers at thatgamecompany. Each developer has a different style and takes a different direction. Each wonders about the potential of digital game design. Filming begins in San Francisco and expands significantly to an observation of processes at thatgamecompany as the team builds, completes and offers JOURNEY, a networked game play for two on PS3, to the public. Composer, Austin Wintory, for JOURNEY, breaks new ground with a score made interactive for networked play. Many aspects of the game design process for JOURNEY received world recognition. Antichamber went on to be heralded as an engagement in "an Escher-like world".(C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>The movie criminally wastes Sam Neill and Rosamund Pike in barely there supporting roles, and the picture has exactly two tones: grim and gooey. They do not coexist harmoniously.</Review>
            <Review>Whatever the intent of the filmmakers, a story that hinges on existential despair requires at least a modicum of emotional credulity.</Review>
            <Review>As British comedy sometimes will, "A Long Way Down" has an occasional attack of the cutes, but the actors' commitment keeps the movie on the plus side.</Review>
            <Review>Tackles the topic of life-ending despair with all the delicacy and grace of a Hallmark greeting card.</Review>
            <Review>Author Nick Hornby establishes a tone of sentimental black humor, and director Pascal Chaumeil orchestrates the encounter as the formation of rag-tag band where each player gets a stirring solo number.</Review>
            <Review>There are moments of tenderness and honest human emotion buried in the frustrating "A Long Way Down" but one has to work far too hard and give far too much credit to the over-qualified cast to grab at them.</Review>
            <Review>Surf frolic! Group hug! Bonding! Brosnan was a low-on-the-totem-pole James Bond, but we'll take that Bond over this bonding. Brosnan meanders insincerely through the material.</Review>
            <Review>I enjoyed it, and I find myself hanging onto it, but mostly because of the interesting combination of its cast members, and the way they communally grapple with hopelessness.</Review>
            <Review>"A Long Way Down" doesn't bother to explore its characters on any substantial level and comes close to offending in how flippant the whole thing is to the subject of suicide.</Review>
            <Review>A very long way down indeed.</Review>
            <Review>It lunges along in predictable fashion through a series of quirky contrivances that might be tasteless if they weren't so trite.</Review>
            <Review>The film struggles with a meandering story and superficial characters who do little to elicit compassion from the audience.</Review>

            <Review>A pale imitation of the early novels of Bret Easton Ellis, who wrote about young ennui and aimlessness from the inside out.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately, "Palo Alto" is a messy yet haunting portrait of a particular time in life.</Review>
            <Review>It's accurate to say that "Palo Alto" is another movie by another Coppola about the lives of the rich, bored and disaffected, but that description sells the movie short.</Review>
            <Review>While it shows Coppola has talent, it's also as aimless as her characters' self-absorbed, self-medicated, joyless lives.</Review>
            <Review>That Coppola finds occasional grace and spirit here shows understanding and compassion. Her next assignment? Make a movie that's not about the troubles of the privileged and bored.</Review>
            <Review>These slippery slices of life feel like the most honest, relevant film portrait of adolescence in ages.</Review>
            <Review>The reality is that for many, [these] four years are marked by a more moderate, complicated set of things, and not the relentless bleakness displayed in [the] film.</Review>
            <Review>The drama is scaled to just the right size: kids get into trouble or inadvisable situations, but there are no major melodramatics. We see them in their natural habitat.</Review>
            <Review>James Franco's collection of autobiographical short stories is adapted into a remarkably evocative film by Gia Coppola, granddaughter of Francis.</Review>
            <Review>Another week, another glacial outing from the ever-expanding Coppola clan depicting the oh so beautiful emptiness of American teenage wildlife.</Review>
            <Review>Palo Alto is as fuzzy, scattered and aimless as its protagonists' lives.</Review>
            <Review>The story tends to meander but the kids' ups and downs are delicately observed and the performances, especially from Roberts, are never less than believable.</Review>

            <Review>The actors are decidedly mismatched -- not to each other, but to the material.</Review>
            <Review>Words and Pictures stars Clive Owen and Juliette Binoche - a matchup that makes you want to like Fred Schepisi's film, even when it becomes impossible to do so.</Review>
            <Review>One of those films that you want to like rather more than you actually do.</Review>
            <Review>No, it's not fair that "Words and Pictures" isn't the movie we'd like it to be. But if it were better at being the movie it wanted to be, that wouldn't be an issue.</Review>
            <Review>If you're looking for a date night option, you might find that spending the time in company of Owen and Binoche is good value, but the pictures here tend to overshadow the quality of the words.</Review>
            <Review>It is a joy to see a film that tackles the topic of art and its value in the world, and all the better that actors of Owen's and Binoche's caliber can lead it.</Review>

            <Review>A dazzling documentary about an unsolved murder in an ad hoc community in the Galapagos islands in 1934.</Review>
            <Review>"The Galapagos Affair" spins a strange and compelling tale, with perfectly sinister music by Laura Karpman setting the mood. But the movie is better at building suspense than following through.</Review>
            <Review>The film feels less like a whodunit than a "why didn't they do it sooner?"</Review>
            <Review>Though the pace occasionally flags during its two-hour running time, "The Galapagos Affair" is a fascinating look at a place of great beauty and remoteness, and at the kind of people drawn to live there.</Review>
            <Review>Move over, Charles Darwin, when it comes to great tales about the Galapagos, you've got company.</Review>
            <Review>In this gripping true-crime story, an absurdist stew of petty tensions and quasi-Nietzschean dynamics rip apart the tiny colony of Europeans who settled one of the Galapagos islands in the '30s.</Review>
            <Review>holds the viewer and compels him</Review>
            <Review>The wealth of letters and journals, read by a strong cast that includes Diane Kruger and Connie Nielsen, provides an instant emotional charge.</Review>
            <Review>To make a thrilling documentary about the past, you need dead people who were honest or creative in ways you can exploit. This extraordinary film, which deconstructs a murder mystery from the Thirties, has such people in spades.</Review>

            <Review>Despite the impressively committed performances by the two leads and the screenplay's touches of sly humor, the proceedings are mostly all too redolent of the endless found-footage horror films that have followed in the wake of The Blair Witch Project</Review>
            <Review>"Willow Creek" is a defiant slow burn.</Review>
            <Review>Mr. Goldthwait gives us lovely, buttery daylight scenes, nicely relaxed leads and dialogue that pays attention to fluctuating gender dynamics.</Review>
            <Review>The parts are greater than the whole, but there's a lot to like here, including the easy interplay between the leads.</Review>
            <Review>He may be seriously slumming by putting a modern spin on 1972's The Legend Of Boggy Creek, but at least Goldthwait's done his homework.</Review>
            <Review>A found-footage horror cheapie that turns out to be its creator's warmest, most satisfying work.</Review>
            <Review>Af ound footage experience that actually works.</Review>
            <Review>Probably the best Bigfoot horror flick out there.</Review>
            <Review>Enthusiasts of the simplicity of the original "Blair Witch" picture will admire that it falls well within the tradition of keeping things low-tech.</Review>
            <Review>Willow Creek is a well-crafted, slow-burning horror that uses the found footage approach to deliver a movie that is just as much about what you don't see as what you do. A found footage movie as it should be done.</Review>
            <Review>While the final "reveal" feels at once expected but out of nowhere, Willow Creek is a solid look inside the mind of someone obsessed with one of our weird national myths.</Review>
            <Review>Bobcat Goldthwait has proven himself to be such an outside-the-box visionary, it's unfathomable that his fertile mind could produce something as pedestrian as Willow Creek.</Review>

            <Review>Is this story compelling? Will it keep your attention for its 95-minute running time? Is it worth the ticket price? Sadly, the answer is: not quite.</Review>
            <Review>The title refers to the adage that actions speak louder than words, but a movie that reduces children and parents to cardboard saints doesn't say much.</Review>

            <Review>This is solidly made, but once you get past the attempts at realism - the banter, the backstories, the music, the clothes - it's a desperately corny yarn.</Review>
            <Review>The set-ups are familiar, the characters well worn and the film-makers' message (we are all victims) writ cornily large. But co-writer Chin is an imposing screen presence of whom we may expect more in future.</Review>
            <Review>Preachy and cliched, Victim has some merit in the bantering dialogue and fresh, appealing performances but all the good intentions don't necessarily add up to a good film.</Review>
            <Review>It doesn't quite come together, yet there's some rough'n'ready force.</Review>
            <Review>A few solid observations aside, this is the urban thriller running on low-fi autopilot.</Review>
            <Review>Both script and cast deserved better.</Review>
            <Review>This British urban youth thriller isn't anything new, but is still an authentic and thought-provoking piece of gritty drama with energetic performances and a solid script.</Review>
            <Review>Anuva barrel of 'hood clichés it might be, but the sharp cast and snappy script (by Chin and co-star Michael Maris) make it fresher and funnier than it sounds.</Review>

            <Review>It knocks down a lot of the infrastructure the previous films had created, and it does so in a way that feels organic and refreshing for the Marvel world at large.</Review>
            <Review>A movie that is, in the best sense of the word, a Marvel.</Review>
            <Review>Beneath the expensive, computer-generated busyness of this second Captain America installment is a bracing, old-style conspiracy thriller made extra-scary by new technology and the increasingly ugly trade-offs of a post-9/11 world.</Review>
            <Review>If Captain America: The Winter Soldier is indeed an augur of things to come during this special-effects-laden summer, maybe it won't be such a painful season after all.</Review>
            <Review>This is the first Marvel Studios movie since the original Iron Man that really stands on its own.</Review>
            <Review>In "Winter Soldier," amidst the chaos, our hero learns to be wary of the modern world. Welcome to the 21st century, Cap.</Review>
            <Review>Marvel has made what amounts to the biggest-budgeted paranoid thriller of all time.</Review>
            <Review>'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' delivers the superhero movie goods, but it does so with a grin and a wink, and that seems more and more like the right way to approach these things.</Review>
            <Review>An excellent sequel, filled with lots of action and suspense. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Its heroes are weird, broken people, its villains facades of prosperity and authority, and the stakes conversely high - the fate of the world - and deeply personal.</Review>
            <Review>Marvel should take what Captain America: The Winter Soldier does and use it as the rubric to follow with subsequent phases.</Review>
            <Review>Screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, who also wrote Captain America: The First Avenger, continue to make Cap the most interesting Avenger outside of Iron Man.</Review>

            <Review>If it's patchy and derivative it also has a compelling, soapy undertow that kept me watching.</Review>
            <Review>[Laranas] delivers a maximum of suspense and horror, working wonders with a small budget.</Review>
            <Review>This philosophical film helps elevate the film above the usual scared-teenager shocker although, sometimes, the film ignores the bread-and-butter demands of the genre.</Review>
            <Review>The film's three-pronged narrative does a fair job of laying a spooky groundwork for the revelatory emotional sadism that lies behind most acts of evil; it just takes a bit of clunky exposition to get there.</Review>
            <Review>A powerfully atmospheric blend of ghostly encounters, horrific situations and missing-persons mysteries from the Philippine director Yam Laranas.</Review>
            <Review>This low-budget shocker eventually pays off, displaying just enough narrative ingenuity to compensate for a cinematically crude and logistically sketchy deployment of the requisite blood-and-guts mayhem.</Review>
            <Review>Laranas definitely has the mind and vision for good horror, but still has a bit to go before he can be called a 'master of the genre.'</Review>
            <Review>While effectively moody...proves overlong for optimal shock value, with entirely too many dull stretches along the way.</Review>
            <Review>Genre fans beware -- 'The Road' proves a bumpy ride, slow-going, monotonous and, the most unforgivable sin of all, not in the least scary.</Review>
            <Review>... Enough rattling thrills for the date-night crowd, and enough story and character for older film buffs to chew on. The ride home afterwards might require your high beams.</Review>
            <Review>Heavy on atmosphere, but light on substance.</Review>
            <Review>For a spell, the film gets by on its unpretentious flair for atmosphere, even its disconcerting nonsensicality.</Review>

            <Review>A roughly chronological jumble of archival footage, unconvincing period reenactments, gauzy voice-overs, and half-baked ideas that makes one yearn for the stolid dullness of a History Channel documentary.</Review>
            <Review>Deftly weaves together various media in a way that breathes its own youthful, stream-of-conscious life into the documentary genre.</Review>
            <Review>There's no "there" there in "Teenage," a meandering mess of a documentary that has the feel of a bloated, inchoate term paper.</Review>
            <Review>Wolf's sympathy for youth movements compensates for the distraction of the new scenes, and the fascinating old footage seals the deal.</Review>
            <Review>If Teenage delivers a sweeping generalization or two (or three) ... Wolf's documentary makes up for it with footage that's just too good to be ignored.</Review>
            <Review>Director Matt Wolf uses startling archival footage to capture the rise of pre-Elvis youth culture as the defining surge of the 20th century.</Review>
            <Review>This movie does have interesting snippets of history about people on society's fringes, especially people who were way ahead of their time in terms of youth culture, but if you want a better overview of this issue, you will have to read the book.</Review>

            <Review>Fixating on the fat rolls of underprivileged kids without mentioning class, the film is a more polished version of the greasy tale Morgan Spurlock's Super Size Me told from the inside out.</Review>
            <Review>It's a decent summary of the issue, taking square aim at corporations and politicians who have made it easy for the citizenry to stuff its collective face with junk food and, even more damaging, sugar.</Review>
            <Review>Director Stephanie Soechtig gathers activists, doctors, kids, lobbyists, parents, politicians, reporters and teachers -- all with different stakes.</Review>
            <Review>Exposé against America's nutritional war on itself is informative, passionate, slightly regurgitated.</Review>
            <Review>Thumbnail portraits of morbidly obese kids introduce a plaintive note to the argument, especially since, as the documentary notes, many school cafeterias are now indistinguishable from fast-food joints.</Review>
            <Review>"Fed Up" gets to feeling like a special nightly news report. But as news reports go, it is an especially thorough and well-produced one, taking an in-depth look at America's worsening obesity epidemic and pointing fingers at culprits</Review>
            <Review>Fed Up is a documentary about choice and accountability, but it's awfully picky about whose choice and whose accountability are to be evaluated. The result is a documentary about sugar that should probably be taken with a grain of salt.</Review>
            <Review>Wow ... talk about sobering food for thought ...</Review>
            <Review>The film is more adept at placing blame than offering solutions, but it should serve as a call to action for those viewers who walk into the theater with a jumbo popcorn and soda.</Review>
            <Review>Fed Up makes a convincing case for how profiteering factory food corporations conspire to hook people on addictive ingredients they pack into their products. Along with weirdly coopting Michelle Obama to deceptively promote exercise as the obesity cure.</Review>
            <Review>Fed Up, for the most part, boasts the feel of a short news piece that's somehow been expanded to feature length...</Review>
            <Review>...an entertaining message movie that ironically mirrors the easy-to-consume junk that is its subject.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>90</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Under the Electric Sky is an immersive 3D documentary exploring the allure of the EDM phenomenon told through the experiences of six different groups among the nearly 350,000 festivalgoers attending the Electric Daisy Carnival (EDC) 2013 in Las Vegas. Combining those personal stories along with performances by Fatboy Slim, Kaskade, Dillon Francis, Afrojack, Above &amp; Beyond, Armin Van Buren, Avicii, and Ti�sto, directors Dan Cutforth and Jane Lipsitz bring the event to life by going behind the scenes to show what it takes to stage one of the biggest parties in the known universe. They chronicle the unique journeys of individual attendees from different walks of life, all of whom share one common desire - to shed their inhibitions and immerse themselves in this judgment-free celebration of life and music. Renowned artist Kaskade created the musical score to accompany the film, and KCRW music director Jason Bentley acted as the music supervisor for the documentary. (c) Focus Features</StoryLine>

            <Review>Very much like an infomercial.</Review>
            <Review>Though not a great documentary and essentially a colorful, 3D commercial for Electric Daisy Carnival, it works as both an introduction to a subculture many may be unfamiliar with and as a beat-heavy scrapbook for those who were there.</Review>
            <Review>EDC has made headlines with fatal overdoses, so you'd think directors Dan Cutforth and Jane Lipsitz would examine the role Molly and related drugs play here. But the topic is mentioned only fleetingly.</Review>
            <Review>Under the Electric Sky manages to be amusing even while it's annoying you.</Review>
            <Review>If the Boomers had Woodstock and the Xers had Lollapalooza(?), then here's Gen Y's version, complete with Upworthy inspirational stories.</Review>
            <Review>The film's misguided determination to present a PG-13 version of a pasties-optional, three-day party gives an unreal air to a surreal event, though that doesn't mean "Under the Electric Sky" is without its blissful moments.</Review>
            <Review>"Under The Electric Sky" does a great job of showing the appeal of EDM, and can be an occasionally thrilling document of the musicians who create these infections beats. But on a human level, well, it could have used some more electric participants.</Review>
            <Review>There's something slightly queasy-making in how this film summons the tireless piety of a church-recruitment pamphlet to describe what basically amounts to Burning Man as a business model.</Review>
            <Review>As an echo of a era when acid house swept away Club MTV commercial crap and dancing all night took on a new meaning, it falls far short</Review>
            <Review>Just as queerness is conspicuous by its absence, so is any serious consideration of the drug use that often pairs with extended tastings of EDM.</Review>
            <Review>It may be just a feature-length commercial masquerading as a music documentary, but Under the Electric Sky at least sells its product well.</Review>
            <Review>Under The Electric Sky is a fun backstage pass for EDC fans, but for DJ haters it'll just be a loud, obnoxious headache - so they should just stay away and let everyone else eat, sleep, rave, and repeat.</Review>

            <Review>Not a great film and it isn't supposed to be, but Cabin Fever 3: Patient Zero more or less does its job of delivering equal parts laughter and fright.</Review>
            <Review>It's entertaining enough if you're a fan of rotting-girl catfights...and evil conspiracies, but there's no there there and little reason to stick it out to the predictably miserable end except so you can say you did.</Review>

            <Review>If the concept of a moms' night out is premised on the notion that mothers can never get away for fear their families will collapse in their absence, then this movie cruelly confirms that fear.</Review>
            <Review>What ensues is frenetic and never as funny as it should be because directing brothers Andrew and Jon Erwin are not skilled enough at pacing the action and varying the volume.</Review>
            <Review>Basically, the moral of the story is: Don't go out. Because if you do, all hell will break loose - or rather, all heck.</Review>
            <Review>Some of these plot twists require more than the normal suspension of logic that often happens in similar comedies. Yet the characters are all appealing.</Review>
            <Review>Seldom has wackiness been as tedious as it is in "Moms' Night Out," a Christian-themed film that is desperate to make adherents seem wild and crazy but mostly makes them seem incapable of raising children.</Review>
            <Review>It's rare that a movie fails on absolutely every level, but "Moms' Night Out" is a remarkably vivid example.</Review>
            <Review>Moms' Night Out seems, despite the technology, curiously dated and a leap backwards for moms.</Review>
            <Review>Only silly on the surface and examines more truth than some are willing to admit.</Review>
            <Review>It might be easier to appreciate the efforts of these women if they weren't so shrill and obnoxious, which sends the opposite of the intended message.</Review>
            <Review>While the gender roles here may be a bit archaic, I actually found myself thinking that the film went out of its way to show at least some diversity among its characters.</Review>
            <Review>Bland faith-based comedy supports traditional gender roles.</Review>

When they accidentally kill one of the girls during a botched escape attempt, their simmering mistrust explodes into shocking violence. But what they thought was their worst case scenario is only the beginning, as they are engulfed by the hellish forces that haunt the road - a road they realize they may never escape.

        <Duration>86</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Just over 500 years ago, Vlad the Impaler (Gregory Lee Kenyon) returns to his castle to find it over-run by Turks. He sells his soul to the Devil to save his wife and defeat the Turks, turning him to a monstrous demon. His Victory is short-lived, however, as his wife is revived just in time to see him dragged off to Hell. In the Hollywood Hills, a party marks the end of seven friend's high school careers. Dominic (Teo Celigo) seals his love for his anxious girlfriend, Chelsea (Marcienne Dwyer), with a ring that symbolizes their commitment. After they return to the group, Adam (Christian Gehring) reveals to everyone that he has been having increasingly potent dreams that seem to beckon him to a castle in Romania that he found to be the real castle of Vlad the Impaler. His half-mocking group of friend's are shocked to find that he has booked the castle for a week to kick off their graduation Euro-trip. After arriving at the Castle, they find that they will not be the only residents as the castle's groundskeeper, Veronica (Diana Busuioc), opens the castle gates and shows them their rooms. The specter-like groundskeeper proves to be more than she seems as she leads the kids through a bloody ritual to release Vlad from Hell. Shadows, secrets, and scares abound in this dark modern revival of the world's first vampire: the infamous, Dracula. The time has come to summon the world's greatest evil back from Hell. No one will be safe.(c) Official Site</StoryLine>

        <Title>American Promise</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>135</Duration>
        <StoryLine>The American Promise journey began in 1999, when filmmakers Joe Brewster and Mich�le Stephenson enrolled their son Idris in the Dalton School on the Upper East Side of Manhattan after the private institution boldly strengthened its commitment to cultivating a diverse student body. Mich�le and Joe decided to turn the camera on themselves to film the experiences of 5-year-old Idris and his best friend and classmate Seun. The documentary captures the stories of Idris, Seun, and their families from the first day of kindergarten all the way to their 2012 high school graduation. Over the 12 years, we see the boys and their families struggle with stereotypes and identity, navigate learning differences that later become diagnoses, and ultimately take increasingly divergent paths on their road to graduation. We also see a rare and vivid portrait of middle-class African-American families as the parents wrestle with doubts and angst over their sons' educational journey and both families grapple with how best to support their sons and interact with teachers and administrators. All of this is set against the backdrop of a persistent educational achievement gap that dramatically affects African-American boys at all socioeconomic levels across the country.

        <Duration>86</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Last year, public television officials pulled $150,000 in funds they had committed to the documentary and cancelled plans for the film's broadcast premiere, as reported by Jane Mayer in The New Yorker, in fear of losing the financial backing of major PBS donor David Koch, the ultra-conservative billionaire industrialist and WGBH and WNET trustee. In this stunning turn of events, CITIZEN KOCH was effectively censored from the public airwaves. After completing one of the most successful crowdfunding campaigns of all time to make up for the lost production funds, CITIZEN KOCH is now set to hit theaters nationwide. (C) Variance</StoryLine>

            <Review>The movie bleakly emphasizes the sense of debilitating powerlessness of the average citizen without the means to bring anything but their vote to the ballot box.</Review>
            <Review>If the real triumph of the Tea Party is getting middle- and working-class citizens to vote against their own best interests, it's going to take a documentary more passionate and more revelatory than this one to make that point.</Review>
            <Review>If you have a shred of idealism left, it's hard to watch "Citizen Koch" without a mounting sense of despair and outrage over the influence that money has come to wield over modern elections.</Review>
            <Review>"Citizen Koch" is preaching to the choir. Which might not be a pointless exercise, seeing how the choir failed to show up for the last midterm election in 2010, and might need extra motivation not to repeat that mistake this November.</Review>
            <Review>"Citizen Koch" is undisciplined and depressing, yet still strangely worthwhile.</Review>
            <Review>Most of the movie is a backgrounder on the Citizens United case, in which a deeply divided Supreme Court opened the door to truckloads of campaign cash from tycoons and corporations.</Review>
            <Review>If you value civic equality and civil liberties, Citizen Koch is a must see.</Review>
            <Review>For those who didn't know how flawed and manipulated the act of casting a ballot has become, "Citizen Koch" is a decent primer, but for everyone else long past the tipping point, this is just more evidence for a problem that currently has no solution.</Review>
            <Review>It tosses out a lot of information and doesn't pull it into a compelling movie.</Review>
            <Review>May not be the most smoothly organized documentary of the year, but it certainly fires a lot of arrows at its target.</Review>
            <Review>Separate and distinct from being utter catnip for politicos, the dark lessons this engrossing nonfiction film holds... are terribly important ones.</Review>
            <Review>Co-directors Carl Deal and Tia Lessin (Trouble the Water) cohesively illustrate what happens when the bad financial powers-that-be cannot be stopped.</Review>

            <Review>Thanks to Costner's sly, dry-aged charisma, it marches down the field and scores.</Review>
            <Review>"Draft Day" might be a trick play, but it manages to score.</Review>
            <Review>It's a sign of Costner's enduring stardom that he can skate through a movie this hyperactive and dull, yet still have you like him.</Review>
            <Review>We've seen lots of this type of Art of the Deal maneuvering-how GMs spread gossip, bait and switch, gamble, and haggle each other. It never gets old. It's also the best part.</Review>
            <Review>This is a very American film that - not unlike Moneyball - attempts to expand its appeal by doubling down on its focus on the very American sport at hand so as to find the universal themes intrinsic to the game.</Review>
            <Review>For all of the typical sports movie clichés that pop up in "Draft Day," the pic's place as an NFL-sanctioned puff piece is what's most alarming.</Review>
            <Review>However unintentionally, "Draft Day" confirms that sports rewards heroes and villains alike. Remember Jerry Sandusky?</Review>
            <Review>It all gets rather corny, but Costner's charisma will keep you watching until the final whistle.</Review>
            <Review>Sports film fans will lap [Draft Day] up but others may struggle to keep their heads in the game.</Review>

            <Review>Meet Ralph Steadman and his nightmare visions of a world in pain, revealed in a mesmerizing documentary.</Review>
            <Review>The film makes it clear that not only was Steadman perfect for Thompson's work (and a big part of his success), his work stands on its own artistically.</Review>
            <Review>Giving an overlooked luminary his due is reason enough for "For No Good Reason."</Review>
            <Review>As wonderful as it is to watch the man work, and to review many of the startling images he created over the years, the film has its dead spots.</Review>
            <Review>This is most worthwhile for its scenes of Steadman at work, flinging ink all over the place and turning the splatter marks into his signature grotesques.</Review>
            <Review>For No Good Reason sidelines Steadman's own bona fides, functioning primarily as a second-hand documentary of Thompson, stoking the hagiography of the late hipster icon.</Review>
            <Review>The process of creating a painting isn't as automatically intertesting as, say, that of making a film, but...the technical and artistic inspirations that fuel an artist can sometimes be as fascinating as the finished work.</Review>
            <Review>Despite intending to expand upon Steadman's output and impact, the documentary boils the importance of his oeuvre down to the obvious.</Review>
            <Review>It's satisfying that the film exists, as an overdue tribute to an artist who can be appreciated even by those with limited patience for Thompson's posturing prose.</Review>
            <Review>Steadman's illustrations could burst with baroque details, but one thing you would never call them is "busy." They had a focus, a mission, that "For No Good Reason" often lacks.</Review>
            <Review>[For No Good Reason] paints a strong portrait of the illustrator through archival footage, photography, and long discussions with Steadman about his artistic process.</Review>
            <Review>A film for admirers of artist Ralph Steadman, people whose politics align with Steadman's politics and the most devoted followers of Steadman's celebrity fan, Johnny Depp.</Review>

            <Review>Succeeds mightily when it comes to creating tension but struggles a little more with making its plot run together smoothly.</Review>
            <Review>I'd say this is a movie about alienation that, in the spirit of the boldest activism, isn't afraid to be ostracized itself. You may beg to differ, and I'd say that's the point.</Review>
            <Review>Night Moves, including its title, borders on generic.</Review>
            <Review>Reichardt wisely leaves it for her audience to decide.</Review>
            <Review>"Night Moves" is an unexpected pleasure, offering more than what we expect and taking its time to deliver.</Review>
            <Review>You may not buy the third-act developments, but Reichardt and her actors see to it that you believe in how these people got to that third act in the first place.</Review>
            <Review>Reichardt's richly drawn characters make it often fascinating, as we observe their contradictions and very human failings, and finally build to a daringly unresolved finale.</Review>
            <Review>If Night Moves is a misstep-and it is-it's a testament to Reichardt's talent that, all things considered, it's still a pretty good film.</Review>
            <Review>The film makes a good point-often those zealously caring about dead deer enough to dynamite a dam are hyper-focused to the point of oddly lacking compassion for fellow humans.</Review>
            <Review>Night Moves calls us (inadvertently or not) to reconsider our definition of what's "natural." Certainly, some of the ways we've failed to care for the planet as we were charged back at the beginning have had dire consequences. Let's not ignore that.</Review>
            <Review>The film serves as a reminder that our greatest fear isn't necessarily getting caught in the act; it's getting caught down the line.</Review>
            <Review>Reichardt has crafted a mesmerising, unsettling film about the ripple effects of our decisions and how we live with them.</Review>

        <Duration>91</Duration>
        <StoryLine>In the harsh, wintry woods of rural Quebec, Bruce (Academy Award (R)-nominee Thomas Haden Church), a down-on-his-luck snowplow operator, accidentally kills a man during a drunken night joyride. Stricken with panic, he hides the body and takes to the deep wilderness in hopes of outrunning both the authorities and his own conscience. But as both begin to close in, Bruce falls apart mentally and morally and mysteries unravel to reveal who he was before the accident, the truth behind his victim, and the circumstances that brought them together in a single moment. A darkly comic noir in the vein of the Coen Brothers, Emanuel Hoss-Desmarais's WHITEWASH is a gripping exploration of a well-meaning Everyman at the end of his rope.(c) Oscope</StoryLine>

            <Review>Largely because of a pitch-perfect final line and a Haden Church performance that brings a dose of needed compassion, Whitewash manages to keep its footing.</Review>
            <Review>The viewer is left in a snowblind limbo that makes it awfully difficult to stay engaged.</Review>
            <Review>An airtight demonstration of the maxim that no good deed ever goes unpunished.</Review>
            <Review>Thomas Haden Church bridges the credibility gap in snowed-in fugitive tale.</Review>
            <Review>Whitewash is a small but sparkling gem on ice.</Review>
            <Review>Despite Church's solid performance, Whitewash feels so leaden in its gravity, it borders on dull.</Review>
            <Review>It may be small and compact, but Whitewash has a sure, strong voice that deserves to be heard.</Review>
            <Review>This film effectively shows a descent into madness, of a man going crazy in the solitary confinement of a prison he himself built. It is also an effective story of crime and punishment.</Review>
            <Review>Whitewash will have you rooting for a man who did a very, very bad thing.</Review>
            <Review>In a tale of survival, in both the physical and criminal sense, Church lays out of an agenda that is both demanding of himself and philosophically sound.</Review>
            <Review>A bemusing semi-thriller full of low-key quirkiness that's elevated by Church's personable performance.</Review>
            <Review>Emanuel Hoss-Desmarais' nuanced character study may run on many different cylinders, but all are tuned to the same end.</Review>

        <StoryLine>These are street kids from poor families where everyday violence, mental illness, corruption, and dope-dealing compete with fantasies of escaping to Western Europe to earn scads of money or dreams of making it as a professional soccer player. They are subject to the lure of religious fanatics who blame their misfortune on "the imperialist Zionist conspiracy" and offer a "community of new brothers" to those who will submit to the discipline of martyrdom. Nabil Ayouch's deeply moving film has been lauded for its "brutal poetry" and the realism with which it depicts how insidiously and cynically fundamentalists ply their trade. The film was presented as part of Un Certain Regard at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival. (c) Film Forum</StoryLine>

            <Review>"Horses of God" is one of the most forceful entries in a growing body of cinema that interrogates the causes and effects of terrorism, nationalism and fundamentalism in the Arab world.</Review>
            <Review>Director Nabil Ayouch does a remarkable job of putting you inside this brutal world, from the garbage dumps that serve as playgrounds to soaring aerial shots of the endless tin roofs that form their neighborhood.</Review>

            <Review>Rom-com tropes like the ''meet-cute'' are so tired that you can't just spoof them -- you have to spoof the spoofs, which this winking David Wain-Michael Showalter parody mostly succeeds at doing.</Review>
            <Review>We'll have what they're having.</Review>
            <Review>Wain's film is both a takedown and a tribute: As with his summer-camp-movie spoof Wet Hot American Summer, you walk away with a renewed love for the genre.</Review>
            <Review>The problem with They Came Together is that what it settles on as the parody-able thing about romantic comedy is how generic it can feel.</Review>
            <Review>Simply recreating what we know to be hackneyed and safe doesn't suddenly make it hilarious and surprising. There has to be a spin to it; there has to be some innovation.</Review>
            <Review>At times laugh out loud-inducing, but ultimately feels more like a promising Saturday Night Live skit (the romcom couple?) than a standalone piece of entertainment.</Review>
            <Review>It's still possible to make a spoof movie that is biting, merciless, clever, and (most importantly) uproariously funny.</Review>
            <Review>In an era where much of the spoof genre simply lazy repeats scenarios, [the film] brilliantly and hilariously deconstructs every aspect of the genre to provide one of the funniest films one is bound to see this year.</Review>
            <Review>The film feels fatuous and irritatingly complacent. Everybody's calling attention to the barrage of familiar clichés without doing much to subvert them.</Review>
            <Review>Hopefully will shame a few screenwriters into not writing that next Jessica Biel-Ashton Kutcher film.</Review>
            <Review>They Came Together is here to kill romantic comedies, and yet, it's five years too late, like a Terminator who hasn't accounted for daylight savings.</Review>
            <Review>It nails the romantic comedy spoof perfectly, to the point that even if you hate rom coms you can still enjoy it for its skewering of them.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 1984</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>115</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Firestarter is based on a bone-chilling novel by Steven King. Drew Barrymore plays Charlie McGee the young daughter of Andrew (David Keith) and Vicky (Heather Locklear) McGee, who years earlier had been guinea pigs for a top secret experiment. As a result, Charlie has acquired the unenviable ability to start fires simply by thinking about fires. Charlie is pursued over hill and dale by The Shop, a secret government organization bent upon using her skills for nefarious purposes. The special effects are undeniably startling, even when the script and dialogue are straight out of the funny papers (it's hard to keep a straight face during the New York Times final shot!) The high-priced cast--including George C. Scott, Art Carney, Louise Fletcher--seems to be having a grand ole time. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <ReleaseDate> 2013</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>77</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Part psychological thriller and part provocative character study, A TEACHER explores the unraveling of a young high school teacher, Diana (Lindsay Burdge), after she begins an affair with one of her teenage students, Eric (Will Brittain). What starts as a seemingly innocent fling becomes increasingly complex and dangerous as the beautiful and confident Diana gets fully consumed by her emotions, crossing boundaries and acting out in progressively startling ways. Lindsay Burdge delivers a deeply compelling and seamlessly naturalistic performance that brings us into the mind of an adult driven to taboo against her better judgment.

            <Review>The movie is lifeless for its first hour, and the last-minute outpourings are too little, too late.</Review>
            <Review>"A Teacher" will leave you feeling drained, even exhausted. That's about right for a movie about obsession, one with no resolution except waiting for the other thud to drop.</Review>
            <Review>An evocative but ultimately hollow indie drama.</Review>
            <Review>The diminishing returns in part are due to Burdge's performance, which too often settles for the same look of fraught anxiety. But they also result from Fidell's decision to pare her film down to the barest elements.</Review>
            <Review>Ms. Fidell ... has a fine eye but not the makings of a feature-length movie here and, it quickly becomes clear, isn't interested in this relationship or the moral, ethical and legal issues it raises.</Review>
            <Review>Fidell's mature style and Burdge's lack of guile are engaging. As the film's emotions grow darker, a lack of ideas comes through.</Review>
            <Review>Hannah Fidell drops us into her emotionally heavy drama A Teacher-devoid of the logistics in lieu of the insatiable connection they so obviously share.</Review>
            <Review>A starkly bitter antidote to the basic cable movies-of-the-week that have traditionally been made about teacher-student affairs.</Review>
            <Review>An intimate, tres European, two-character piece free of easy moralism that ranks among the best debuts in recent memory.</Review>
            <Review>Lindsay Burdge gives a fine performance in this film. The story starts out looking predictable, and it is. The only mystery is why the main character behaves the way she does, and that is not explained.</Review>
            <Review>Failed to excite me.</Review>
            <Review>As the teacher, Lindsay Burdge gives a stunning performance.</Review>

            <Review>This British heist picture is familiar but energetic genre filmmaking, more interesting in its particulars than in its overall conception.</Review>
            <Review>A British heist movie that's well deserving of an American audience.</Review>
            <Review>The shallow, derivative and contrived British heist thriller "Wasteland" lives down to its unfortunate name.</Review>
            <Review>To borrow from a term for the gritty, working-class British dramas that this film also nods to, it's a kitchen-sink caper.</Review>
            <Review>It creates two admirably entertaining storytelling strands - one a friendship saga, the other a robbery caper - yet can't merge the two successfully.</Review>
            <Review>Athale has a flair for guy-pal banter; here, the talk is funny and profane, silly and profound, often in the same breath.</Review>
            <Review>We're decades past the Kitchen Sink school, this kitchen's sunk.</Review>
            <Review>The end result is a slick, satisfying debut.</Review>
            <Review>The sarcastic banter and male chemistry between Treadaway, an outstanding Iwan Rheon, Gerard Kearns and Matthew Lewis provide as much pleasure as the mechanics of the twisted revenge plot.</Review>
            <Review>It may not be immune to the odd Brit thriller cliché, but this is an assured, stylish heist thriller from the debut filmmaker.</Review>
            <Review>The final act's too cocky by half, but otherwise this is canny, characterful stuff.</Review>
            <Review>Smooth, accomplished British crime indie tweaks clichés of the genre in a marvelously satisfying way.</Review>

        <StoryLine>"Out of the Clear Blue Sky" tells the riveting, behind-the-scenes story of Cantor Fitzgerald. It's a story of disaster without precedent. What do you do when everything - and almost everyone - is gone? On September 10, 2001, financial firm Cantor Fitzgerald was headquartered on the top 5 floors of the World Trade Center. With offices soaring 100 stories above downtown Manhattan, the Wall Street powerhouse was unknown to the public until tragedy struck. On September 11, 2001, 658 of their employees were missing - presumed dead - in the nation's worst terrorist attacks. Overnight, Cantor became world famous for the worst of all possible reasons.

            <Review>As in most documentaries, spliced-in reenactments are unhelpful. Still, what this movie shares is of great consequence, a moving and unlikely story in a tapestry of stories about a tragic and unlikely event.</Review>
            <Review>A complex story is compellingly told in this powerful 9/11 documentary.</Review>
            <Review>Danielle Gardner's eloquent insider documentary about the Sept. 11 destruction and subsequent rebirth of the investment firm Cantor Fitzgerald.</Review>
            <Review>[Gardner] interweaves stirring, ever-troubling9/11-related archival news footage, with personal photos and videos plus some, frankly, dispensable re-enactments.</Review>
            <Review>Like every individual's story of Sept. 11, this one has hidden drama, heartbreak and renewal, adding yet another thread to the tapestry.</Review>
            <Review>A film made by and for the families of those Cantor Fitzgerald employees who lost their lives on 9/11, and for them it is by definition beautiful and striking. For everyone else, it might not quite work.</Review>
            <Review>Closure or exploitation, you be the judge.</Review>
            <Review>By de-emphasizing politics in favor of humanitarianism, Danielle Gardner's work also suggests how Americans might yet unify even as the world around them threatens to tear itself apart.</Review>
            <Review>Compelling - it's an insider's poignant view of the harrowing tragedy.</Review>
            <Review>...a Tolstoyan reminder that all tragedies are unique.</Review>
            <Review>Forget everything you think you know, set aside all the platitudes, and see this highly engaging and deeply moral film for yourself. We owe it to the past, but more important, we owe it to the future.</Review>

        <Title>Aleister Crowley: Legend of the Beast</Title>
        <ReleaseDate/>
        <Duration>80</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Since the onset of the human race there have been those who instinctively understood the nature of reality and sought to impose their will upon it by co-operating with and honoring the forces that governed it. Although History has left a rich legacy of Magick, Magicians and Wizards with such names as Pythagoras, Paracelsus, John Dee, Cagliostro, Israel Regardi and Eliphas Levi, in the modern era there is only one whose name is still spoken with fearful reverence as the most powerful and influential magician who ever lived - Aleister Crowley. Hailed as the wickedest man alive and called the Great Beast 666 by his own mother, Crowley was also one of the most accomplished philosophers, poets, authors, mountain climbers, chess players and sensationalists of his or any other time. Aleister Crowley was a magnet to all, many were drawn to his presence and exceptional wisdom but there were also those that he repelled. This film looks back on one man's amazing journey from his death bed. From his devout Christian upbringing through his many aspirations as he looks back on his life, the sadness, the triumphs, the glory and the pain of how he lived and loved. The myth of the Satanist is dispelled and the true nature of a flawed but great man is left. A man who dared to live by his own true will in a time of ignorance, a man with many demons who invoked and manifested unimaginable spiritual forces, a man who truly understood the realms beyond our reality and claimed, "Do What You Wilt Shall Be The Whole Of The Law." Reality Is What You Make It.</StoryLine>

            <Review>There is less reporting on poverty in America than on any other major societal issue. So it is with AIDS. That alone makes The Normal Heart an important film.</Review>

            <Review>Matt Bomer is heartbreaking as a New York Times style reporter looking for love in a loveless city. His physical transformation is astonishing and agonizing.</Review>
            <Review>Time, and rewrites, have softened some of the play's stridency. More important, the romance between Weeks (Ruffalo) and his lover, Felix (Bomer), is given a more prominent role as is Felix's death spiral, giving the story power both broad and intimate.</Review>
            <Review>Moving, well acted and important for a generation who may be unfamiliar with the source material. But the TV version, also written by Kramer, doesn't have the emotional heft of the play.</Review>

            <Review>The collaboration between Murphy and Kramer seemed like a natural from the moment it was announced, and now we have the proof of that sensible decision -- in all its incendiary, heart-wrenching magnificence.</Review>

            <Review>What's missing from Blended? Two key ingredients: it doesn't touch the heart and it doesn't tickle the funny bone (at least not often enough).</Review>
            <Review>The romance is sweet and even effervescent, the comedy is homespun and sentimental, but it's packaged with such a repellent batch of stereotypes and prejudices that it's unpalatable even to contemplate.</Review>
            <Review>In the world of this sitcom love story, men are from Mars and women should be from a defiled menstrual tent far enough away that Adam Sandler won't have to hear them talk about tampons.</Review>
            <Review>Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore star in Blended, their third pairing, and, while the chemistry may be good, the movie isn't.</Review>
            <Review>Comedians often draw on childhood influences, and Adam Sandler and his team do it in the worst possible way in Blended.. [which] is like a Bizarro version of The Brady Bunch.</Review>
            <Review>Sandler would piss out of the screen if he thought he could get a laugh. This is not his worst film, but it's his most offensive.</Review>
            <Review>To summarise in as few words possible: it is a film, it has people in it, the lighting is adequate and there's a monkey band playing Careless Whisper. Can I go home now and stare into the dark abyss that is my life please?</Review>

        <StoryLine>Trust Me tells the sharp, comic story of Howard Holloway, a down-on-his luck agent for child actors and truly one the last good guys left in Hollywood. After discovering a 13-year-old acting prodigy, he is poised to close the deal of a lifetime which would catapult his tween client and, at long last, himself, into the big time. With the support of his gorgeous new neighbor, he must wrangle the actress' volatile, overprotective father, dodge a scheming producer, and outwit his uber-slick nemesis. As he arrives on the brink of the Hollywood dream that's eluded him for a lifetime, he begins to sense that his innocent young starlet may not be quite what she seems.</StoryLine>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>There's a fine tradition of acerbic movies that skewer Hollywood: Think "Sunset Boulevard," "The Player" and "What Just Happened," to name a few. The dark-humored "Trust Me" is a worthy addition to the list.</Review>
            <Review>There's certainly humor running through writer-director-star Clark Gregg's "Trust Me," the tale of an inept agent for child actors; it's just that not all of it feels intentional.</Review>
            <Review>As long as Gregg, as both actor and director, is anatomizing the Hollywood viper pit, Trust Me rings true.</Review>
            <Review>Its perky poster notwithstanding, "Trust Me" is a putatively hard-edged comedy that promises to turn into something harder.</Review>
            <Review>As the movie picks up speed and undergoes sudden, confusing plot reversals, it loses its satirical edge.</Review>
            <Review>"Trust Me" contains so much terrific writing, acting and observation that it becomes a bit easier to forgive writer-director-star Clark Gregg when his ambitions best him during the movie's convoluted last third.</Review>
            <Review>It is a smart, funny, endearing, and entertaining glimpse into a part of Hollywood rarely depicted in film.</Review>
            <Review>Despite solid performances, the cast can't inject much sympathy into these characters or their self-indulgent plight.</Review>
            <Review>Seems forced into much darker territory in its final act. Gregg provides a prologue to foreshadow it, but it still doesn't quite fit.</Review>
            <Review>Trust Me is a great offering from Clark Gregg that really puts the man's skill - in writing, directing, and performing - on proud display.</Review>
            <Review>A grim portrait of an agent for young actors who takes his best shot at success in the nasty and venal Hollywood film community.</Review>
            <Review>Really can't compete on any level, being insipid and mean-spirited.</Review>

            <Review>Prostitution in polite society is still a nettle fearfully grasped. You see, society is not polite and it's about time movies stopped peddling that fluff.</Review>
            <Review>Never amounts to anything more than its title's shallow descriptors.</Review>
            <Review>Ozon keeps things simmering without quite boiling over, even when convention might demand it.</Review>
            <Review>Trying to figure out Isabelle keeps the viewer engaged, and Vacth's focused acting justifies her being almost continually in the frame.</Review>
            <Review>Francois Ozon's quiet sexual drama raises more questions than it answers.</Review>
            <Review>It's a candid but insightful character study about adolescent impulses that feels more insightful than exploitative.</Review>
            <Review>...echoes Luis Bunuel's 1967 classic Belle de Jour in some obvious ways</Review>
            <Review>It is a nuanced look at a young woman's exploration of her own power, and lack thereof, as she rushes headlong toward adulthood.</Review>
            <Review>Is she a virgin, or a whore? Surprise, she's both! This French drama about a teenager is infuriating in its reductive stereotypes.</Review>
            <Review>The result is a movie that feels more like a lab report than any cogent exploration of the human condition, but again, it's this clinical approach that best approximates the female psyche as girls come of age.</Review>

            <Review>Alas, there are no sparks. There is no excitement. Hopkins' clumsy script simply bumbles its way past plot holes into predictabilities.</Review>
            <Review>Most everything about this movie is predictable within the first few minutes ...</Review>
            <Review>Hopkins managed a genuine delight a few years ago with "Last Chance Harvey," starring Thompson and Dustin Hoffman as two late-in-life lovers in London. But his new script has none of that wit.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Janek is a technician on a climate observation station high up in the German Alps, one of a team of scientists preparing their outpost for visit from the Environment Minister. Their routine is interrupted by a strange discovery; a red liquid pouring from a nearby glacier, melted free from the ice crust that is shrinking with climate change. When the 'glacier blood' comes in contact with the local wildlife, it causes changes that are at first curious, then horrifying. Soon Janek and his team have their hands full defending themselves and the station against a growing horde of biological monstrosities. Using every tool at their disposal they must learn to work together to survive the onslaught. Harking back to classic creature features, director Marvin Kren combines classical filmmaking techniques with imaginative practical effects to produce a rollercoaster ride of laughs and jolts.

            <Review>Yes, this is gruesome Euro-horror about the climate apocalypse and the possible end of life on earth as we know it, but it's also fun for the whole family.</Review>
            <Review>"Blood Glacier" is too sleepy to do anything with its guano-stirring premise.</Review>
            <Review>Sometimes genre-based filmmakers don't know how to make their material fun without making fun of their material, but that's not a failing of Mr. Kren's.</Review>
            <Review>As if climate change weren't worrying enough, studies show it's leading to an uptick in the production of cheesy German-language monster flicks.</Review>
            <Review>The attempts made to flesh out Janek and Tanja's rocky relationship, especially, are pure Screenwriting 101 contrivance.</Review>
            <Review>The monsters are a scream, squishing crossbreeds that are all fur and teeth and exposed, pulsing, ready-to-burst viscera. And the screamers are a bit monstrous ...</Review>
            <Review>Blood Glacier, with it's mostly practically created monsters, wastes an opportunity to distinguish itself from the many CG-dependent horror titles that saturate cinemas.</Review>
            <Review>This is one of those endeavors that will no doubt endure the test of time on viewing lists of very ambitious bad movies.</Review>
            <Review>Doesn't have a rich imagination, and while its locations are gorgeous, nearly saving the viewing experience, the mayhem contained within is lukewarm at best.</Review>
            <Review>Decent gore, fun creatures and its high-concept premise make Blood Glacier an enjoyable night out</Review>
            <Review>Blood Glacier is exactly why English dubbing should be abolished for foreign movies. It destroys what could have been a fun creature flick with emotionless, bland voice work that does nothing but distract.</Review>
            <Review>When it comes to low budget horror movies, sometimes the less you see ends up being the most effective...Kern should have applied this...to the unconvincing, Ed Wood-worthy monsters, and Blood Glacier would have been a much more successful film.</Review>

            <Review>Despite decent performances, a promising dramatic set-up leads to little of real interest.</Review>
            <Review>The anguish of the lovers' decade-long separation can't be evoked in a matter of minutes ...</Review>
            <Review>The actors are smoothly professional and the production feels polished. But it's hard to recommend a romance without passion, no matter how pretty it looks.</Review>
            <Review>The magnetism between these stiff nonstarters wouldn't stick to a fridge, especially when the war-ex-machina forces them apart for years but the only credible passing of time is our own.</Review>
            <Review>This awkward, passionless drama conveys neither the sensuality nor the drawn-out sense of longing required by its period tale of a young secretary who falls in love with his employer's wife.</Review>
            <Review>Though by no means an unbearable watch, A Promise is almost as much an exercise in patience for its viewers as it is for Friedrich and Lotte.</Review>
            <Review>The main drawbacks are the grey decorousness of the pacing and visuals, and Richard Madden's unsympathetically flat playing as antihero Fritz.</Review>
            <Review>Nonetheless, at its best, it has some of the same qualities as Ophüls' [Letter from an Unknown Woman].</Review>
            <Review>When a French filmmaker travels to Belgium to film a German story in English, it's hardly surprising that the resulting movie feels somewhat awkward.</Review>
            <Review>The lack of chemistry between Madden and Hall drains the film of energy and their unrequited longing is often unintentionally amusing.</Review>
            <Review>If you only watch one Stefan Zweig-inspired film this year, watch The Grand Budapest Hotel. If you watch two, see The Grand Budapest Hotel twice. Awful.</Review>
            <Review>A particularly languid, slow-burning period drama.</Review>

            <Review>The gripping thriller is meant as a shocker to provide a wake-up call to the world about the necessity of confronting past atrocities.</Review>
            <Review>Despite an unnecessary and rather gruesome plot turn near the end, Aftermath remains a terrifically acted and well-told story that will open a lot of eyes in its portrayal of despicable human behavior.</Review>

            <Review>A good-looking and exceedingly polite film where perhaps a more complex one with less good manners would have been better.</Review>
            <Review>It's an old-fashioned movie with a very modern streak, centered by a vibrant star turn by Mbatha-Raw, whose watchful, wise Dido makes an enchanting heroine.</Review>
            <Review>Charming and stirring.</Review>
            <Review>Luminous British actress Gugu Mbatha-Raw brings a hope and intelligent hunger to Dido. She's loved by her family enough to have a sense of belonging but hemmed in by broader cultural realities to experience moments of unease.</Review>
            <Review>The film simply looks lovely, never moreso than when Mbatha-Raw is on screen.</Review>
            <Review>Belle presents an interesting history lesson, one that had significant repercussions, but some of the developments in this storyline turn out to be woefully convenient.</Review>
            <Review>It is a well-crafted tale that brings humanity to an issue that continues to resonate, even in a time when slavery theoretically does not exist: How do you fit into a society that sees your skin colour first, negating your humanity?</Review>
            <Review>More or less single-handedly saved by its actors.</Review>
            <Review>Though having the kind of pedestrian pace which often hits British costume dramas (Keira Knightley's 2008 film The Duchess excepted), Belle is sumptuously filmed and feels relevant.</Review>
            <Review>The teenage Dido Elizabeth Belle is impressively played by Gugu Mbatha-Raw with a tender sensibility and a growing awareness.</Review>
            <Review>The film works as both an intimate character piece and as a broader glimpse into socioeconomic conflicts regarding tolerance and perception.</Review>
            <Review>Though it is based on a true story, that can't save the film from falling into the trap of being overbearingly moral at times and far too polite.</Review>

        <StoryLine>The devastating horror of a nuclear apocalypse is now reality and nine desperate strangers find themselves clinging to life in a farmhouse cellar, while radioactive fallout descends on the darkened world above. These would-be survivors face the nightmare of dwindling supplies, poisonous air and the greatest threat of all - the hordes of zombie-like refugees who want in. With each dying day, their choice becomes clearer - stay and let the makeshift shelter become their tomb or face the unknown terrors of the world outside. Starring Edward Furlong, Monica Keena, Andre Royo and C.J. Thomason, AFTERMATH takes a hard look at how far humans will go to survive. And it isn't pretty. (C) Image</StoryLine>

            <Review>An often tedious but clammily atmospheric end-of-the-world thriller set in the wake of a nuclear holocaust.</Review>
            <Review>This is the story, understand, of a group of people taking shelter in a basement following a nuclear holocaust. It's pretty clear right from the start that all or most of them will die. Good times.</Review>
            <Review>There's very little that actually thrills in this well-constructed, if underwhelming film that works best as a how-to vid for nuclear war-minded DIYers.</Review>
            <Review>Essentially, we're watching dead people refuse to lie down, yet the acting isn't terrible, and Scott Winig's photography is satisfyingly bleak and grimy.</Review>
            <Review>Though they won't win any prizes for originality, writer Christian McDonald and director Peter Engert have fashioned a fairly involving, slow boil of a thriller that's as eerie as it is grim.</Review>
            <Review>No one will be anointing "Aftermath" a feel-good triumph anytime soon, but there are flashes of unanticipated sensitivity and disquieting inspiration that cannot be denied.</Review>
            <Review>It is clear there is only one realistic place that this film can be going.</Review>
            <Review>There's a compelling idea at work here, as well as an admirable willingness to explore the darkest reaches of that idea. Those things are, however, continually undone by a misguided script and weak direction.</Review>
            <Review>...in practical terms Aftermath is likely to disappoint viewers expecting a fun action movie with monsters.</Review>
            <Review>Awash in exposition-heavy dialogue, punctuated by the occasional Wizard Of Oz reference, the film provides no meaningful background on its characters, and even less drama.</Review>
            <Review>Aftermath's strongest sequence is its opening, as the crisis unfolds and everybody speeds to shelter. The breakneck pace of this does a good job of building up adrenaline and crating a sense of high drama that lingers even when the story slows down.</Review>

But that so-called normalcy gets tossed out the window when an unexpected and devastating event occurs at a nighttime pool party. As the alcohol begins to wear off and the body count rises, all hell breaks loose and there is no going back. As if the foul mouths, perverted attitudes and devious natures of Tabitha and Mimi were not enough, then just throw in Tabitha's walking porno of a boyfriend Sean and his new best friend, the sweet Dutch. Then mix in Mimi's eighteen year old virginal, confused and prudish sister Kylene and her sexually challenged boyfriend Harris, and the events gets even saucier. Then shoot in a splash of the old pervert Marc and his crazy unhinged wife Lola, and then toss in the Bible-thumping Jesus-freak Thelma...</StoryLine>

        <Title>Elephant Man</Title>
        <ReleaseDate/>
        <Duration>112</Duration>
        <StoryLine>This TV adaptation of Bernard Pomerance's play The Elephant Man differs radically from the 1980 theatrical film of the same name. Both are based upon the same true story: that of John Merrick (1863-1890), an unfortunate citizen of Victorian England who suffered from neurofibromatosis, a hideously deforming disease that all but condemned him to a lifetime of circus sideshows. Though he remained trapped in his misshapen body, Merrick was intellectually and emotionally liberated by London physician Frederick Treves, whose sensitive treatment of the "Elephant Man" unlocked the soul beneath his horrific appearance. But whereas the film was graphically realistic in its use of makeup, the TV version follows the precedent set by Pomerance's play: John Merrick's deformity is conveyed purely through the vocal and physical contortions of actor Philip Anglim, repeating his Broadway role. Also carried over from the stage version is Kevin Conway as Dr. Treves. The TV version of The Elephant Man was telecast as an ABC Theatre of the Month special on January 4, 1982. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <ReleaseDate> 1946</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>72</Duration>
        <StoryLine>One of several low-budget mellers directed by scriptwriter Maxwell Shane, Fear in the Night was based on the short story Nightmare by William Irish (pseudonym for Cornell Woolrich). In his first starring role, DeForest Kelley plays Vince Grayson, a young man who has a terrible nightmare wherein he sees himself killing someone. When he awakens, Vince finds a couple of pieces of evidence indicating that his dream was no dream. Detective Cliff Herlihy (Paul Kelly) doesn't believe that Vince has killed anyone, but agrees to investigate. While taking shelter from a storm in a remote mansion, the detective and the young man stumble upon a mirrored room -- just like the one in Vince's dream. The frenzied Vince is nearly driven to suicide, but Detective Herlihy deduces that his friend's nightmare was the handiwork of Lewis Belnap (Robert Emmett Keane), the mansion's owner, who is a dabbler in hypnosis. Fear in the Night was remade in 1956 as Nightmare, with Kevin McCarthy and Edward G. Robinson. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>Acknowledging Hurricane Sandy, "Jersey Shore Massacre" reminds viewers that it's hardly the worst disaster to hit the region. But it gives the Hindenburg stiff competition.</Review>

            <Review>The Double doesn't get very deep, but it does get interesting.</Review>
            <Review>"The Double" has a theatrical, self-conscious quality to it; the performances feel stagy and its production design looks like a grimly monotone Wes Anderson movie.</Review>
            <Review>"The Double" is a striking piece of work, but it's nostalgic for a kind of paranoia that may no longer exist. There are different things to frighten us now.</Review>
            <Review>Most of the time, "The Double" feels less like watching a book than reading a movie.</Review>
            <Review>Ayoade has crafted a smart, high-concept puzzler with a keen sense of comedic timing and a fine cast littered with familiar faces.</Review>
            <Review>Although Existentialism is out of fashion these days, I think a lot of people will be able to identify with Simon's plight in this film. It works as both absurdest comedy and as social commentary.</Review>
            <Review>Bleak dark comedy about contemporary urban alienation.</Review>

        <Duration>83</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Michael King (Shane Johnson) doesn't believe in God or The Devil. Following the sudden death of his wife, the documentary filmmaker decides to make his next film about the search for the existence of the supernatural. Michael decides to make himself the center of the experiment - allowing demonologists, necromancers, and various practitioners of the occult to try the deepest and darkest spells and rituals they can find on him - in the hopes that when they fail, he'll once and for all have proof that religion, spiritualism, and the paranormal are nothing more than myth. But something does happen. An evil and horrifying force has taken over Michael King. And it will not let him go. Dale Dickey (IRON MAN 3), Tomas Arana(GLADIATOR), and Julie McNiven ("Mad Men") co-star in this intense supernatural spine-tingler from the producers of WHITE NOISE and THE HAUNTING IN CONNECTICUT.

            <Review>Nowhere near as rigorous as the "Paranormal Activity" movies it superficially resembles, writer-director David Jung's increasingly unpleasant, rarely frightening debut feature won't possess screens for long.</Review>
            <Review>Why would a possessed Michael continue to operate the camera or even turn on night vision? You simply can't capitalize on a filmmaking fad by shortchanging the audience.</Review>
            <Review>Jung's film goes through all the machinations of a found footage possession film with about as much creative spark as an apathetic teen checking off a list in a film class that he hates.</Review>
            <Review>Dim in wits and lighting, "The Possession of Michael King" strains our eyes, spits on our intelligence and saps our generosity of spirit.</Review>
            <Review>"The Possession of Michael King" is more scary than original.</Review>

            <Review>Se o Diabo existisse, ele seria o responsável por este filme.</Review>
            <Review>Potentially intriguing questions about faith and organized religion are quickly jettisoned in favor of cheap scare tactics and formulaic gore.</Review>
            <Review>When a premise is juicy enough and the accompanying script is good enough, it can go a long way in smoothing over certain irksome deficiencies. For that matter, so can a host of legitimately earned scares.</Review>
            <Review>While David Jung's debut film ticks all of the right genre boxes and works well technically it suffers from simply lacking originality and being another in a rather long list of found footage chillers.</Review>
            <Review>Conventional horror that doesn't scare or provoke thought about the afterlife. It's a brick of clichés, repellent characterization, and bad acting.</Review>

        <Title>The Olivia Experiment</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>90</Duration>
        <StoryLine>(Olivia is a frustrated 27-year-old Gender Studies graduate student, angry at the porn-centric culture, who believes she's an asexual. While dating and courtship rituals fascinate her in her studies, in real life she has yet to experience sex, let alone mutual attraction. Spurred by her academic advisor's suggestion she "live a little", Olivia accepts her friend Felisha's offer to try sex with her own boyfriend, Julian. And, with the help of a lesbian camerawoman and an encouraging roommate, Olivia sets out to film her first sexual encounter. But in this comedy of sexual disorientation, the results of "The Olivia Experiment" are completely unexpected.c) Indican</StoryLine>

            <Review>While its provocative themes certainly bear exploring in our sex-obsessed societal landscape, The Olivia Experiment is too superficial and cliche-ridden to make them resonate, and its attempts at humor fall thuddingly flat.</Review>
            <Review>The performances are overdrawn and the writing is facile; maybe the hetero male-jock and faux-lesbian eye candy will be enough for you.</Review>
            <Review>When it comes to romantic comedies, it's not often to find one that jumps out as categorically different. But "The Olivia Experiment," astutely directed by Sonja Schenk, turns the genre on its ear just enough to feel refreshingly original.</Review>

            <Review>Unabashedly derivative but nonetheless entertaining.</Review>
            <Review>"Jackpot" plays like an over-the-top story told by a drunken film fan at a bar: "Dude, I just saw this movie and it was CRAZY. You have to see it." Trust me, you don't.</Review>
            <Review>As an absurdist suspense film, "Jackpot" mostly hits its marks. As a comedy, it's less successful, stronger on sight gags than on the detective's sarcasm.</Review>
            <Review>Certainly, a lot of blood is spilled in the name of laughs. There's only one problem with its broad attempts at grotesque comedy: Jackpot simply isn't funny.</Review>
            <Review>Blood-spattered crime comedy benefits from whip-smart pacing and quirky Scandinavian attitude.</Review>
            <Review>Martens punctuates proceedings with moments of black humour and sudden, shocking violence, while the sheer frequency of twists, double-crosses and switchbacks keep the plot rattling along.</Review>
            <Review>Here is a mean-spirited movie about bad-hearted people in which the central question seems to be which of these characters is the nastiest of the lot.</Review>
            <Review>Capable, candy-colored, often giddily gruesome Euro-action from Norway, replete with lottery winnings, double-crosses, discreet vivisection and a shootout in a strip club called "Pink Heaven" with a single survivor whom the police want explanations from.</Review>
            <Review>It's probably a good thing that the characters are so unlikeably dumb in Magnus Martens' violent black comedy Jackpot. You don't want to become attached to any of these guys. They tend to disappear quicker than cast members on Game of Thrones.</Review>
            <Review>Jackpot feels more like Guy Ritchie than the Coen brothers. It revels in moronic violence, unleavened by playfulness or wit.</Review>
            <Review>Chronically let down by a lack of character development, with no spark at the off to get the whole thing rolling.</Review>
            <Review>The recent influx of Scandanavian thrillers and murder mysteries gets an amusingly grimy entry.</Review>

            <Review>It's a grotesque, deadly dull piece of cinematic upchuck, a horror film minus tension or chills. Think "The Toxic Avenger," minus the avenger.</Review>
            <Review>Theaters showing Septic Man should be required to issue hazmat suits at the door.</Review>

            <Review>While Septic Man might sound on paper like a little gem that Troma might have made, it is rather slow moving fare with much rambling around in dark sewers calling out for aid rather than traditional horror fare.</Review>
            <Review>A big, messy, arbitrary handful of stupidity and grossness, lacking any sort of unifying gonzo aesthetic or queasy moodiness.</Review>
            <Review>The yuck factor challenges your gag reflex at every turn.</Review>
            <Review>Some horror freaks are bound to enjoy the show, geeking out over [the film's] grotesqueness.</Review>
            <Review>The subtext remains murky, however, as the story quickly starts to tread water.</Review>
            <Review>A solidly built no-budget picture that will likely appeal to those already in the mood for a disgusting time at the movies -- brave people who prefer their slow-burn cinematic nightmares to be caked in human waste.</Review>

            <Review>Charming perfectly describes... Toy Story of Terror!</Review>
            <Review>It unwinds an engaging plot that should entertain kids and keep their parents amused.</Review>
            <Review>There's much to be said for exploiting such fare judiciously. Yet given that Pixar has the superior stable of titles and their shared parentage, one can hope that ABC will have a friend in Pixar - and be "Terror!"-ized a little more often.</Review>
            <Review>So, while there are some shaky moments of dumbed-down humor, it's not far enough tonally from the films to be glaringly different.</Review>
            <Review>Fans of "Toy Story" will enjoy this adventure that ends on a hilarious final scene typical of Pixar.</Review>
            <Review>Another shining gem from Pixar's most endearing franchise and should be a new Halloween staple for all families.</Review>
            <Review>Playing with the conventions of classic horror movies, the special cleverly incorporates them in a way that stays true to the already beloved Toy Story while also dropping them into a brand new setting.</Review>
            <Review>A brief but entertaining addition to the series canon. Disney's Blu-ray release comes with an audio commentary, three more "Toy Story" short films, and a bunch of other worthwhile extras. An engaging package that is easily recommendable.</Review>
            <Review>The bottom line is that this is genuine family-friendly fun (with some lovely gags aimed purely at the grown ups) and well worth it, especially if you've got Toy Story fans in the family.</Review>
            <Review>If this does well enough - and it deserves to be huge - maybe they can all come back for another TV special. It's that good.</Review>
            <Review>When it comes down to it, Toy Story of Terror is a grab bag of a Halloween special, with more tricks disguised as treats than actual, worthwhile treats.</Review>
            <Review>Shorts like Toy Story OF TERROR! give fans an opportunity to revisit the entertaining Toy Story universe and spend more time with these beloved characters.</Review>

            <Review>Somewhere around the lovely scene of Tilda Swinton dancing, freely and wholeheartedly, to the old soul record, Jarmusch's M.O. becomes clear: 'Only Lovers Left Alive' is a hanging-out move, just with vampires.</Review>
            <Review>If Jamrusch's comedy is snobby and misty is precisely because vampires should be that way. [full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>A great theme and visual compendium. [full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>A delightful Jim Jarmusch film. [full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>The most interesting thing about this movie is the way Jarmusch toys with us to reveal to us a simple thing: it's a vampire story. [full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>If you are able to tolerate the quiet and smooth tempo of Jarmusch , this is a great story.</Review>

            <Review>[An] uplifting underdog story, complete with dance numbers and a sweet romantic subplot.</Review>
            <Review>The movie loses its way with too much plot (including an unconvincing love story), weak dialogue, amateurish acting, and a frustratingly recessive main character.</Review>
            <Review>This elegant, geographically vivid pic is considerably leaner than its melodramatic premise might suggest.</Review>
            <Review>Haroun previously won the Jury Prize in Cannes for his 2010 drama A Screaming Man, and this low-key crime story unfolds with the same kind of thoughtful, resigned fatalism.</Review>
            <Review>In a crowd-pleasing way plays out as an uplifting story of an underdog overcoming his rotten fate.</Review>
            <Review>Démé deserves to be showcased like Keaton or Kelly</Review>
            <Review>For the second consecutive time in a row, Haroun's entry point into the film is that of an elusive, timorous character - making for a fascinating way to peer into a world we already know little about.</Review>
            <Review>Even if the plotting is a trifle trite, that doesn't mean that Haroun can't find ways to surprise.</Review>
            <Review>Grigris measures out its story in spacious doses, hoping to build into something of a morality tale, but there is little learned except that entering a criminal enterprise and trying to outsmart the criminals, probably isn't a great idea.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately too spare to completely satisfy, the pronounced feeling coming out of this film is that it needs more dancing.</Review>
            <Review>[Features] a thin, undernourished script, mountains of clichés, pale local colour and indifferent performances.</Review>

Gaby's farm has been in his family for generations. He always said that the farm should be passed down to his children, not sold. But when Gaby's daughter Marie shows up at the farm in desperate need of money, the old man longs to protect her, even though he senses she is taking advantage of him. Making the decision to sacrifice his farm for the sake of his daughter won't be an easy one for Gaby, but as a father he is prepared to do what it takes for the sake of his family, even if it means abandoning the only life he has ever known. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>"The Quiet Ones" simply has nothing to say.</Review>
            <Review>The Quiet Ones is a pretty ironic title for a horror film whose primary scare tactic is to periodically crank up the volume, sending the needle to the red with a sudden spike in the decibel levels.</Review>
            <Review>Unfortunately, it's all very familiar and somewhat tediously played out.</Review>
            <Review>"The Quiet Ones" is rated PG-13, but it's scarier than R-rated gorefests, like "Proxy," "Nurse 3D," and "American Mary." Anyone can create disgust; creating slowly-building disquiet is entirely another proposition.</Review>
            <Review>The Quiet Ones is uninspired even by contemporary horror standards - which comes as a bit of a shock, given its pedigree.</Review>
            <Review>A retro possession story that will wind up being best remembered for its groovy '70s setting (lots of mutton-chop sideburns and T. Rex and Slade songs on the soundtrack) and a deliciously sinister performance from Jared Harris.</Review>
            <Review>This one floats right through the eyes, past the brain, and out the other side with little more than a whiff on the old neurons.</Review>
            <Review>"The Quiet Ones" is elegant genre work, and Harris' performance is delightful - over the top, but delightful - his annunciation alone worth the price of admission.</Review>
            <Review>Well-shot, well-acted and, well, kinda boring.</Review>
            <Review>We get the prerequisite booga-booga, often visualized incoherently via grainy footage.</Review>
            <Review>There is a lot to admire as the film embraces a pleasing brand of old-school chills over modern-day, pop-culture hipness.</Review>
            <Review>With its many desperate attempts at scares and a completely lacking narrative, "The Quiet Ones" is a failure on just about every level.</Review>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>West's found-footage structure doesn't always entirely make sense, but it's easy to forgive "The Sacrament" its flaws.</Review>
            <Review>The first half is a cautiously dread-inducing tour de force... The second half, however, when all hell breaks loose a little too quickly, is the disappointment.</Review>
            <Review>Everything that happens is what you'd expect, and the choice of subject and the modifications West has made to the generic conventions don't add much to the suspense or thrills.</Review>
            <Review>The Sacrament may not be a good movie, but it has enough virtues - enough gripping, well-put-together moments - that it made me reconsider my opinion of West as a director.</Review>
            <Review>The tension fizzles as The Sacrament narrows into predictability, indulging every cliché of found-footage filmmaking and Jonestown-styled cult apocalypticism.</Review>
            <Review>Gives enough unsettling atmosphere and upsetting gut-level shock that this viewer didn't mind too much all the stuff he wasn't getting ...</Review>
            <Review>Genuinely creepy and upsetting, the picture showcases West's ability to make even a tired subgenre marginally fresh.</Review>
            <Review>What some may see as "slow and uneventful storytelling" I see as "subtle and masterfully sustained suspense."</Review>
            <Review>Although this film is classified in the horror genre, it plays more like a suspenseful drama. This film shows that director Ti West has the potential to move beyond the horror genre, as so many other directors have done before him.</Review>
            <Review>Unimaginative shocker.</Review>
            <Review>An overwhelmingly unoriginal thriller. "The Sacrament" borrows heavily, if not totally, from the 1978 Jonestown Massacre. But, it can't get the chills that even a bad documentary on Jonestown could give.</Review>
            <Review>The film has a ticking time-bomb quality that pays off in the accelerating violence of the breathless final act, which is more grim than gory, with the high body count one would expect from a movie inspired by Jonestown.</Review>

            <Review>The preposterousness of this plot marks Fading Gigolo as a vanity project, but it's hard to take Turturro too much to task when he hits so many other grace notes in between blowing his own horn.</Review>
            <Review>The premise is preposterous and many of the gags are tasteless, yet the tone is gentle, even elegiac, and the players are surprisingly sensitive.</Review>
            <Review>A story that pretends to be about sex but is actually focused on revealing the true nature of intimacy.</Review>
            <Review>"Fading Gigolo" may be far from perfect, but it's near impossible to dislike.</Review>
            <Review>The chemistry is just right between Allen and Turturro, who immediately register as best friends for life, and between Stone and Turturro, whose mutual awkwardness gives way to a goofy form of passion.</Review>
            <Review>While Allen emerges from this mash-up relatively unscathed, Turturro as an implausible male prostitute gets maimed at the intersection of comedy and drama.</Review>
            <Review>In his own films, Woody tends to give the meatiest lines to his costars while he walks off with the wisecracks. Here he finds a most gracious host in Turturro, who happily focuses the spotlight on his prize casting coup.</Review>
            <Review>Turturro and Allen make for a good double act in some strong scenes, but the film as a whole feels light, without too much real substance.</Review>
            <Review>You wouldn't think that a comedy about a Brooklyn florist who becomes a professional gigolo could possibly be dull, especially one that holds out the prospect of a threesome involving Sharon Stone and Sofia Vergara.</Review>
            <Review>Though not a Woody Allen picture, it's clear Fading Gigolo is heavily influenced by the work of its supporting actor.</Review>
            <Review>In today's economy, Gigolo opens a new service option, but the movie's concept works better when played for absurdity.</Review>
            <Review>... an uneven effort that contains some big laughs even as it struggles to find a consistent tone.</Review>

            <Review>About the best thing one can say about this fiasco is that Webb has taken only two films to reach the same exhausted, exhausting endpoint that Raimi required three to achieve. It's progress, of a sort.</Review>
            <Review>This is a movie that needs to remove a piece of jewelry.</Review>
            <Review>The trouble with director Marc Webb's disappointing sequel is it wants to have it both ways: to take seriously human connection and loss and also spin the spectacular and pulpy... Spider-Man 2 never locates that sweet spot.</Review>
            <Review>The studios and the producers have to split the difference -- between excellence and adequacy, between darkness and light, between seriousness and fun. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 might have been split too far. It doesn't taste like anything.</Review>
            <Review>Even the twist feels like it comes up short of its intended emotional weight, and it's hard to think fans will remember this installment as anything special 10 years from now.</Review>
            <Review>The problem with Marc Webb's reboot of Spider-Man can be boiled down to one word: scale.</Review>
            <Review>'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' will certainly make a bazillion dollars, but after you sit through it - all 142 minutes of it - it's very hard to work up a compelling reason that it needed to exist, aside from the aforementioned bazillion dollars.</Review>
            <Review>As a former trainer, the reviewer feels the spider-bod should be rockclimber-ish. All that pulling and hauling should result in some truly epic lats, and Popeye forearms.</Review>
            <Review>This second outing does have its faults (including a dizzying pace that makes it hard to savor the film) but it definitely delivers the thrills, suspense and a sheer, undiluted adrenaline charge.</Review>
            <Review>Sony has now fully bought into the narratively-damaging idea that teasing what's to come is more important than the film itself.</Review>

        <StoryLine>In I Am Happiness on Earth, Emiliano looks at his life with the eyes of a film director, mixing the objective reality with the processes of artistic creation. The story he is filming flounders with his daily life, until his world is trapped in the lens of his camera. Confused, always alone and in front of a screen, now a transfigured reality, but at the same time a measurable, controllable and manipulable one. He listens to a song on a loop: one of those songs you sing or repeat as a prayer and forcing you to remember, believe and convince yourself. (c) Breaking Glass</StoryLine>

            <Review>Not to be a killjoy, but had Hernández simply made a more straightforward, conventional movie about the life and loves of a rising gay Mexican film director, he might have had something.</Review>
            <Review>If the film defies conventional form, it does so without the gravitas that conceptual cohesion brings, quickly rendering its experimentation into gratuitous aesthetic masturbation.</Review>
            <Review>(Director Julian) Hernandez provides loads of sexy scenery but not much sense. The film is heavy on slow, sensual storytelling that more often than not demands viewers' intuition rather than offer clearly delineated characters and relationships.</Review>
            <Review>...Hernandez merely revels in his own pretentiousness, staging one dully limp encounter after another with self-conscious camerawork and absurdly stilted drama that renders the entire project a pseudo-porny slog.</Review>

        <Duration>79</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Vancouver-based voice artist Ashleigh Ball has been the voice of numerous characters on classic cartoons such as Care Bears, Strawberry Shortcake, Cinderella and more. When Ashleigh was hired as the voice of Apple Jack and Rainbow Dash on the 4th generation installment of Hasbro's My Little Pony series, she had no idea she was about to become an internet phenomenon and voice celebrity among a very unique type of fan...The Bronies. The subculture of middle aged men who are obsessed with the show My Little Pony. The documentary "A Brony Tale" not only gives us an inside look into the incredible niche world of these men, but also an intimate look into the courage it takes to just be yourself...even if that means liking a little girls cartoon.</StoryLine>

            <Review>A Brony Tale, as an ethnographic study of this culture, is a bit disjointed</Review>
            <Review>Cheery docu dispels stereotypes of male My Little Pony fans.</Review>
            <Review>This is an accessible, briskly paced documentary about a phenomenon that warrants exactly the level of investigation Hodges has given it here.</Review>
            <Review>While it could have benefited from more insight from the people involved with show and follow-up commentary from Bryan, the movie poses interesting questions about gender roles in modern society.</Review>
            <Review>At the same time, it's fascinating to watch Hodge peel back the curtain and show this community in all its perplexing glory.</Review>
            <Review>As Brent Hodge vividly illustrates in his entertaining, insightful and affectionate documentary about a seemingly bizarre subculture, there's more to this phenomenon than meets the eye. Heck, it might even make a Brony out of you.</Review>
            <Review>The payoff is just lovely, helping to revive A Brony Tale when it needs it the most, returning focus to the primal release of a man who's terribly excited about group of cartoon ponies and their shared adventures.</Review>
            <Review>Some of its subjects definitely register high on a creepy meter, but the film does provide an interesting look at our expectations of manliness, gender norms and comments on sexuality.</Review>
            <Review>Situates the phenomenon inside an identifiable world rather than setting it aside like it's some kind of otherness.</Review>

            <Review>Fernandez is astute in the way he fills the empty hours on screen. He sets a slow steady rhythm and embraces lingering shots and long silences to catch the way the days are lazy about unfolding, especially for Sebastian.</Review>
            <Review>The movie has a small story but a big theme; the theme being experience, and it conveys the emotions and moods of its characters by taking things nice and slow.</Review>
            <Review>This second feature by the Mexican director Aarón Fernández is a delight.</Review>
            <Review>Eventually you begin to wonder what these series of standstill moments represent.</Review>
            <Review>A studied, coming-of-age narrative that makes a familiar tale sing.</Review>
            <Review>Aarón Fernández captures one of the most heartening elements of sex: that it doesn't always oblige our rules or expectations.</Review>

            <Review>When war or other disasters strike, children suffer the most. Uncomprehending, powerless, they can only endure.</Review>
            <Review>Here's a story of refugee life from the perspective of a brash and attentive kid, one just discovering - and often rejecting - the political realities grown-ups accept.</Review>
            <Review>A soft-centered child's-eye view of alienation, toughened by fine acting and Hélène Louvart's full-bodied photography.</Review>
            <Review>An earnest piece of social realism from a child's point of view.</Review>
            <Review>Political without point-scoring, Jacir remains true to a child's-eye view, with Asfa's delightful, exuberant performance always upfront.</Review>
            <Review>Palestinian filmmaker Annemarie Jacir's second film is slight yet significant - and, because of the situation in Syria, timely - story about a boy whose courage inspires hope among the hopeless.</Review>
            <Review>When I Saw You perhaps comes a little close to cliche sometimes (perhaps it's impossible to watch guerrilla scenes without thinking of Woody Allen's Bananas), but there are great moments and vignettes.</Review>
            <Review>Gently comic life lessons emanate from horrific warfare in this measured and poetic mother-and-son drama.</Review>
            <Review>Like Antoine Doinel in The 400 Blows, Tarek has a way of using defiance and sarcasm to make himself seem smarter than any ostensible authority figure.</Review>
            <Review>Its denouement may feel like a cheat, but is perhaps one of the few ways one can justifiably end a story like this.</Review>

            <Review>Invited to sit in the facing seat, we have long minutes to watch, listen and assess, considering who these pilgrims are and what, aside from worship, has really brought them here.</Review>
            <Review>"Manakamana" is simple in conception, but the reactions it evokes in viewers will be complex and multifaceted.</Review>
            <Review>"Manakamana" is a haunting experience, one that requires patience (and then some) but that offers spiritual, philosophical, and aesthetic rewards beyond the immediate power of words to describe.</Review>
            <Review>The directors, Pacho Velez (who did the camera work) and Stephanie Spray (who recorded the sound), condense world history into the confined space of a glassed-in bubble.</Review>
            <Review>By focusing on such a narrow slice of Nepali life, Ms. Spray and Mr. Velez have ceded any totalizing claim on the truth and instead settled for a perfect incompleteness.</Review>
            <Review>Manakamana doesn't answer any questions, yet makes its point: Nepal, like the rest of our planet, is a picturesque but far from peaceable kingdom.</Review>
            <Review>It's hard to describe the passions and joys that Manakamana manages to cohere while celebrating its world.</Review>
            <Review>This truly remarkable, beautiful film, the latest from Harvard's Sensory Ethnography Lab... refrains from feeding us context via traditional documentary tropes such as title cards or voice-over narration.</Review>
            <Review>This is an interesting experiment as a movie, but I don't think it is a terribly successful one. It takes a lot of patience to sit through the dull bits, where nothing much happens, to get to the more interesting parts.</Review>
            <Review>A two-hour film with Nepalese as its first language, no introduction, no narration and no dramatic arc sounds like a challenge, in much the same way that unshelled lobster is delicious: both require a little patience.</Review>
            <Review>If only the viewing environment were more suited to casual contemplation, allowing the audience (like the passengers) to dip in and out of the car in 10-minute stretches.</Review>
            <Review>A gimmicky observation of life in Nepal, this is one of those documentaries that offers the audience an experience rather than any actual information.</Review>

            <Review>John Sayles is too talented, too authentic and too original to make a flat-out bad movie, but he flirts with it in "Go for Sisters."</Review>
            <Review>This buddy/road film builds tension with its missing person quest in a border-crossing underworld.</Review>
            <Review>A sci-fi-horror yarn stocked with a winning cast but hobbled by a lamebrained script and dull set pieces.</Review>

            <Review>A dangerous border town as no country for old men or middle-aged sisters either.</Review>
            <Review>Even the smallest of the many roles in the cast has some telling detail, and Olmos makes the most of a grumpy bear rousted from his hiding place.</Review>
            <Review>Sayles' original screenplay uses the broken criminal justice and immigration systems as a backdrop for its story, never pushing a political agenda at the expense of its human one.</Review>
            <Review>Few other filmmakers could handle this material with such an even hand.</Review>
            <Review>While this film is not up to LONE STAR, it is an involving if low-key thriller that uses the setting with its drug gangs and illegal emigration scams as palpably as a character.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 1984</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>141</Duration>
        <StoryLine>In this emotional roller coaster ride, Robert Harmon (John Cassavetes) is a street-wise, sometimes obnoxious writer currently working on a book about the seamier side of buying/selling love, and Sarah Lawson (Gena Rowlands) is an emotive wife and mother struggling through a divorce and custody battle. When Sarah lands on Robert's doorstep with her suitcases, it seems at first that she has returned to her husband. Robert has several women staying at his place (research sources!), but when his real ex-wife arrives with their young son, he sends the women packing. Sarah, it turns out, is Robert's sister. As the two work out their own live's hurdles -- Robert, the unaccustomed father with his 8-year-old son, and Sarah, trying to cope with her custody battle and its results -- their way of handling adversity and personal burdens becomes the real subtext of the film. This film won the Golden Bear Award at the 1984 Berlin Film Festival. ~ Eleanor Mannikka, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>The movie is exasperating, because we never know where we stand or what will happen next. I think that's one of its strengths: There's an exhilaration in this roller-coaster ride through scenes that come out of nowhere.</Review>

            <Review>Cage's investigative method is to shoot first, ask questions later, so it's no wonder his lines of inquiry run into dead ends.</Review>
            <Review>It feels like the dynamic, volatile actor is on auto-pilot, and the rest of the movie doesn't do much to back him up.</Review>
            <Review>Tired, lazy, incongruous, shocking and hilarious in all the wrong places, "Rage" is destined for the graveyard television slot, squeezed between infomercials for mops. Perhaps there is a good drinking game in here somewhere.</Review>
            <Review>Even the stylish fight sequences don't have much of an impact because the film takes itself way too seriously.</Review>
            <Review>Judging from the lack of quality on the screen, perhaps it's time for Cage, Glover, and Stormare to throw in the towel.</Review>
            <Review>It's sobering conclusions are heartfelt, but ultimately unearned.</Review>

        <StoryLine>THE PAST IS A GROTESQUE ANIMAL is a personal, accessible portrait of an artist - of Montreal frontman Kevin Barnes - whose pursuit to make transcendent music at all costs drives him to value art over human relationships. As he struggles with all of those around him, family and bandmates alike, he's forced to reconsider the future of the band, begging the question - is this really worth it?

            <Review>While Kevin Barnes, and the band, are different in some ways from other musicians and bands, they are also similar in a lot of ways. This is a slightly above average musical documentary, not very different than many others in this genre.</Review>
            <Review>Jason Miller's fantastic new documentary ... presents a frank, complex portrait of an artist who has been pushing the limits of his medium for almost two decades.</Review>
            <Review>Laced with plenty of performance footage, "The Past" peels back the curtain on one of the strangest--or some might say most pretentious--music collectives currently going.</Review>

Eastman and Laird's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles presented a completely original breed of super hero. It was too bizarre, too crazy. It broke all the rules and should never have worked. Until it sold out. Again and again and again. For 30 years. Now, peek under the shell and see how this so-called "happy accident" defied every naysayer to become one of the most popular and beloved franchises in the world.</StoryLine>

Prompted by a study that revealed that boredom may actually be a stress condition, the documentary begins with the 2011 London riots, which, although they were started for political reasons, were spread partly by - you guessed it - boredom! In this festival favorite called "an absolute must see!1" and "anything but boring2", audiences will visit The Boring Institute, where cutting edge-research is taking place, meet a woman who can never be bored, discover which common, everyday substance you probably use masks boredom - and much more!</StoryLine>

            <Review>There's something flimsy and unformed at these characters' cores, something that no amount of jumpy close-ups, skittering sideways glances, and rainy music can make up for.</Review>
            <Review>Buoyed by some nicely nuanced performances (especially by Pearce and Amy Ryan as his dream-dashing wife), Breathe In never quite rises above its predictable potboiler premise.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>90</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Pierre Dulaine, an internationally renowned ballroom dancer, fulfills a life-long dream when he takes his program, Dancing Classrooms, back to his city of birth, Jaffa. Over a ten-week period, Pierre teaches 10-year-old Palestinian-Israeli and Jewish- Israeli children to dance and compete together. Dancing in Jaffa explores the complex stories of three different children, who are forced to confront issues of identity, segregation and racial prejudice as they dance with their enemy. The classroom becomes a microcosm of the Middle East's struggle to work together harmoniously while still caught in the politics of the region and race. With the guidance of Pierre, the children learn to dance together and trust one another. Dancing In Jaffa offers an up-close-and-personal perspective of how the future might unfold if the art of movement and dance could triumph over the politics of history and geography.

            <Review>This doc is a little scrappy, but it's very sweet.</Review>
            <Review>We barely get to know the children or see much of their dancing. By the time the winner of the competition is announced, it is not much of a surprise, and there is little emotional payout.</Review>
            <Review>Dulaine comes off as grossly opportunistic, playing the compassionate clown with the children and using the most self-aggrandizing language imaginable to explain his methods to teachers and parents.</Review>
            <Review>"Dancing in Jaffa" is a charming, often moving documentary about how dance can work magic in breaking down barriers.</Review>
            <Review>While the movie can feel disjointed at times, bouncing around to cover so much territory, the climax of the kids's ballroom competition makes up for any quibbles.</Review>
            <Review>A documentary that doesn't force-feed its message of hope but genuinely earns it.</Review>
            <Review>Despite the whiff of reality TV, only the very hard-hearted could fail to be charmed.</Review>

            <Review>"The Moment" is a psychological thriller more muddled than the mind and the maze it is caught up in.</Review>
            <Review>Watching the movie becomes a kind of parlor game: Is Lee capable of murder? Which moment is the moment?</Review>
            <Review>You don't ever really know what's going on, but at least the heavy-handed music tells you what to feel.</Review>
            <Review>The Moment is another in a long string of thrill-free psychological "thrillers" that fail from start to finish.</Review>
            <Review>Viewers must work as hard as Lee to determine past from present; you may feel amnesiac yourself by film's end.</Review>
            <Review>After you sit with [The Moment] for a while, you realize that it just doesn't get crazy right.</Review>
            <Review>A risible film but not an evil one, The Moment is made all the more painful by its seemingly earnest intentions.</Review>
            <Review>The film is a hybrid of a Lifetime movie focused on a "strong woman," a run-of-the-mill murder mystery, and a yogurt commercial from hell.</Review>

            <Review>"Filth" lives up to its title and then some, but a no-holds performance by James McAvoy is reason enough to watch.</Review>
            <Review>Credit the filmmakers with descending persuasively into the swampy squalor of a diseased mind. If you're in the mood to go there with them, Filth offers an indecently bracing wallow.</Review>
            <Review>I'm not sure I can recommend the movie, but this actor and this performance are something to behold.</Review>
            <Review>Viewers hungry for a catch-all dose of Welshian sardonicism would be better served checking out Trainspotting. Better soundtrack, for one.</Review>
            <Review>"Filth" demonstrates that contemporary filmmakers would do well to fine new ways of getting their hands dirty.</Review>
            <Review>Unlike Jude Law's similarly offensive title character in Dom Hemingway, McAvoy is given a far better story to work from.</Review>
            <Review>Filth is a flawed but ultimately engaging and harrowing bit of moral theater.</Review>
            <Review>After all is said and done, the director and main actor still manage to create a measure of sympathy for this almost-Machiavellian character because we've also caught a glimpse of the man underneath the coke-snorting, whisky-drinking bigot.</Review>
            <Review>Walks on a thin line between grotesque entertainment, perversion and the inestability of its main character, in a middle point between a dark comedy and a masoquistic fantasy. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Captures perfectly and expands on the colorful but pessimist junkie pop lover style set by Fight Club and Trainspotting in a modern time. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>This is one of those movies where much of the non-Scottish audience would need subtitles and a Scottish slang dictionary. It is brimming with profanity and explicit sex scenes and an amazing performance by James McAvoy.</Review>

            <Review>[Hardy's performance is] the reason you'd see Locke, and the reason you may remember it fondly, long after the ride ends.</Review>
            <Review>Yes, it sounds like a gimmick. But Tom Hardy is so compelling, multilayered and terrific in the title role, this one-man show is never dull.</Review>
            <Review>As you'd expect from a story that never leaves the confines of a car, Locke is intense and claustrophobic.</Review>
            <Review>Hardy makes for a compelling psychological tour guide, utilizing much more than his right foot to add forward momentum.</Review>
            <Review>"Locke" is one riveting film.</Review>
            <Review>For the most part, it works like gangbusters.</Review>
            <Review>Together, Knight and Hardy take us on an extraordinary journey.</Review>
            <Review>It's an audacious picture, perhaps a bit gimmicky-but undeniably quite good, and possibly even great.</Review>
            <Review>Knight's picture falls somewhere between experiment and triumph, but it ends up being as engrossing as it is because of the terrific work of Hardy as Ivan Locke.</Review>
            <Review>It's a mesmerisingly watchable movie that will leave you both exhilarated and wrung out.</Review>
            <Review>Writer-director Steven Knight's Locke is literally a one-man show that rests on the able shoulders of actor Tom Hardy.</Review>
            <Review>Tom Hardy's visceral performance in this one-man meltdown packs more drama than a half-dozen multi-character stories.</Review>

            <Review>Wiig's underplaying, a repressed otherworldly Sissy Spacek sort of thing, has its moments of humor, but this proud, simple woman is never for an instant comic.</Review>
            <Review>It doesn't take long for us to get lost in Wiig's thorough portrayal of a dowdy housekeeper who must soldier on in the face of a cruel prank to find some kind of love in her life.</Review>
            <Review>Liza Johnson's nicely tuned, and turned, adaptation of the Alice Munro short story "Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage."</Review>
            <Review>We've never seen a protagonist quite like Johanna, who on the one hand personifies female self-abnegation at its most domesticated, but on the other embodies the sheer will at its most stubborn.</Review>
            <Review>Short fiction can be a marvelous blueprint for film and revisiting Nobel Prize-winner Munro's story in this era of "catfishing" makes a lot of sense: People are no less desperate for connection than they ever have been.</Review>
            <Review>The buttoned-up, buttoned-lipped Wiig seems to have landed in the Midwest from Mars, as though, like David Bowie before her, she's The Maid Who Fell to Earth</Review>
            <Review>It's a film about healing; about burnt-out yang being weeded, fertilized, and watered by yin, to grow a relationship tree. But, like, a Charlie Brown Christmas tree.</Review>
            <Review>Despite its seemingly canned plot, [it] commits to delivering a glimpse into that truth spiced with the joy of optimism rather than the easy placebo of certainty.</Review>
            <Review>Hateship Loveship is by no means a bad film, but it's an unfortunately easy one.</Review>
            <Review>Director Liza Johnston elicits some very affecting performances from her talented actors but these are in service to [Wiig's] rather colorless character whose blossoming is a bit hard to fall for.</Review>
            <Review>...a remarkably delicate portrait of a shy, recessive but ultimately unsinkable woman entirely free of self-pity that confirms the remarkable watchability of Kristen Wiig.</Review>
            <Review>Punchless drama stars a serious Wiig</Review>

            <Review>Parker has made a tough, brutal, and often riveting thriller.</Review>
            <Review>When almost everyone on screen is nursing a pathology, interest in their fates is far from guaranteed.</Review>
            <Review>Whatever "Proxy" lacks in narrative cohesion and psychological realism, it makes up for in its compelling fever-dream quality and its probing questions about the darker side of parenting.</Review>
            <Review>Proxy's greatest attribute is its deliberate dismantling of the audience's assumptions. Writer-director Zack Parker has made a genre whatsit whose central mystery lies in the stealth motivations of its characters.</Review>
            <Review>Like a lot of conspiracy thrillers, the questions it raises prove more compelling than the answers it slowly teases out.</Review>
            <Review>The film is overly long, has its vantage point changed too often, and proves more confusing than entertaining.</Review>
            <Review>The movie has the kind of psychological plausibility that a fever dream does, the kind Blue Velvet does.</Review>
            <Review>Proxy is too many conflicting movies crammed into a daunting 2 hour run time. Zack Parker juggles too many plates at once, and they all come crashing down simultaneously.</Review>
            <Review>It seems director Parker could well have made his point and maintained his dramatic impact without creating such a sadistic streak that emanates through the narrative.</Review>
            <Review>Proxy only seems to illustrate that stupid, insane behavior is spread by proxy and everyone suffers, including the film's audience, because of it.</Review>
            <Review>By the end of the movie's two hour plus (!) runtime, writer/director Zack Parker seems to be saying one thing, over and over and over again: women be crazy.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Nearing thirty, Doug Collins (Brian Geraghty) is dating a woman he no longer loves and doing a job he hates. The "best" years of his life are flying past and he is not looking forward to the rest. Doug's long-term girlfriend Clare (Alexia Rasmussen) despairs of the relationship and decides to move out of their Brooklyn apartment. Doug shares the news with his parents, Milton (Bruce Altman) and Ellen (Henny Russell), both of whom are severely disappointed and neither of whom conceals it well. Despite his guilt at letting down his parents, Doug feels a sense of excitement following the end of his relationship. For the first time in years, he sees new possibilities in life beyond his current situation. When he learns his grandfather has had a stroke, Doug flies home for a visit. At the nursing home, Doug's Grandfather (John Cullum) presents him with a family heirloom: a ring that belonged to Doug's Grandmother. He all but asks Doug to propose to Clare. Seeing his grandfather's weakened condition, however, Doug realizes even more clearly the need to make every day count. He decides he will seek out new adventures he will strive to get the most out of life. As a start, he will climb Kilimanjaro. Doug recruits his strong-willed, well-paid friend Mitch (Chris Marquette) to join him on the trek. He starts training and, at a running track, he meets an athletic, extrovert Yvonne (Abigail Spencer). Doug begins pushing himself to become the man he wants to be. Life begins pushing back. Expenses and troubles pile up. Ultimately, Doug faces a difficult decision of whether to set his new goal aside -- maybe forever -- or to push ahead to the mountaintop.</StoryLine>

            <Review>Gorgeous scenes along the Cornish coast are impressive, but the film lacks the dynamic chemistry between lovers that's so important in a romance-themed movie.</Review>
            <Review>...Summer In February eventually settles into a dull routine much like the dissatisfied characters of the film, which will make for an easily dissatisfied audience.</Review>
            <Review>In the end, it's a miserable movie about miserable people, and we're left to wonder why. But any further time spent considering this forgettable romance feels wasted.</Review>

        <StoryLine>When his fiercely self-reliant mother dies unexpectedly, eleven year-old Atticus is wary of the authorities and flees deep into the forests surrounding his Catskills home. Wandering the woods in shock, relying on what meager food and shelter he comes across, Atticus' grasp on reality begins to fray. His sheltered, off-the-grid childhood dissolves into a directionless life on the move, avoiding other people while trying to differentiate between reality and fantasy. (c) CineReach</StoryLine>

            <Review>Writer-director Tom Gilroy has worked with Yelich previously and makes his youthful character the quiet, watchful center of this 2013 indie drama.</Review>
            <Review>Gilroy takes all of this to a more realistic, more interesting place, and he manages to find an ending for the story that offers a touch of optimism but doesn't feel like a cheat.</Review>
            <Review>As written and directed by Tom Gilroy, it consists entirely of discoveries.</Review>
            <Review>Mr. Yelich is even more emotionally reticent than this central character requires, and "The Cold Lands" feels as if it were just taking hold when it reaches the end of the road.</Review>
            <Review>"The Cold Lands" is aimless and dull, but has a rich tone and upstate authenticity.</Review>
            <Review>Thoughtful and touching ...</Review>
            <Review>Best when dramatizing how the land itself comes alive and serves as a character in its own right, resurrecting the buried history of the US Anti-Rent Resistance Movement of the 19th century. And perhaps a lesson well taught to an endangered rebel child.</Review>
            <Review>A likeable drama about an eleven-year old who survives living on his own in the forest but finds it more difficult to get by when he returns to civilization.</Review>
            <Review>Blink and you'll miss a terrific performance from Lili Taylor.</Review>
            <Review>This sensitive drama about outsiders never gets too deep inside its characters.</Review>
            <Review>The Cold Lands [...] sustains a lovely mood, but keeps the audience at a perpetual distance. It keeps threatening to turn into a movie, but never entirely does.</Review>
            <Review>Demonstrates how isolationism can breed unproductive paranoia. It might not take a village, but it takes at least one other person. Every child needs a parent and every person needs a friend. That is, no man--not even manboys or little men--is an island</Review>

            <Review>Sincere and unexpectedly good, the film happily reintroduces another element of classic kids' movies: a tidy 77-minute run time.</Review>
            <Review>"Bears" could have used a lot more science; more substantive information in the place of wacky one-liners. Still, the images trump everything.</Review>
            <Review>Bonus points for all but eliminating the easy scatological humor. Does a bear (poop) in the woods? You won't find out watching "Bears."</Review>
            <Review>There are grittier nature documentaries out there, but "Bears" is simple and effective, and delivered with that friendly Disney touch. Its intent is to make you say, "awww," and it does its job well.</Review>
            <Review>All this is heartwarming, in a bloody, ursine-centric way.</Review>
            <Review>Despite the bracing beauty of the wilderness, and the respite provided by cubs at play, the movie is primarily a sobering treatise on survival.</Review>
            <Review>I'm not suggesting that every nature film narrator should sound like David Attenborough, but John C. Reilly really seems an odd choice.</Review>
            <Review>Not without its contrivances as it caters to younger audiences, "Bears" is a nonetheless earnest, adorable real-life adventure.</Review>
            <Review>With its touching story, beautiful scenery, and stunning camerawork, "Bears" becomes another worthwhile documentary in the Disneynature library.</Review>
            <Review>constructs a compelling narrative out of what must have been an enormous amount of footage, focusing on the age-old trope of the journey to give the bears' plight for survival a sense of sincere thematic heft</Review>
            <Review>"And luckily, the movie does gets out of its own way (eventually) and tells a somewhat engaging, 'true-life' nature tale."</Review>
            <Review>...the landscape and photography are regularly astounding, and that should be enough to hold most adults' attention for the film's 75 minutes.</Review>

            <Review>Too much of the joy imparted by Muppets Most Wanted has too little to do with the Muppets themselves.</Review>
            <Review>[It] isn't as giddily entertaining as its predecessor but much of the charm remains, making this an ideal destination for a family excursion.</Review>
            <Review>Kids will enjoy it, and there are more than enough clever gags to keep parents amused. But the film lacks the tenderness and rich nostalgia that made The Muppets such an improbable delight.</Review>
            <Review>The songs are infectious, but the rest (despite turns by Tina Fey and Ty Burrell) lacks some of the gang's usual feel-good joy.</Review>
            <Review>The new Muppet movie is as sweet as a bowl of tapioca. And about as interesting.</Review>
            <Review>Opens with a self-referential song that comments on the fact that sequels are never quite as good as the film that inspired them and then goes on to prove the point.</Review>
            <Review>Is this the best Muppet movie that ever has been or ever will be? No. Is it the worst? Not when Muppets from Space exists. But comfortably in the middle of Muppet canon is a pretty OK, Netflixable place to be.</Review>
            <Review>If it doesn't quite manage to equal the total satisfaction of its predecessor, it's hard to get too persnickety about a picture as joyful and sweet as this one.</Review>
            <Review>Knowingly pokes fun at its duties as a sequel - and the disappointment that usually comes with follow-ups - and the results are more than satisfactory.</Review>
            <Review>All the road trip conventions are here, but the fun is in the puppetry, the puns, the sight gags, the interaction between Muppets and humans, and the exceptional music.</Review>
            <Review>Muppets Most Wanted embraces its absurdity and fearlessly allows its contrivances to shine-always playing for laughs above plausibility and never taking itself seriously.</Review>

            <Review>The filmmakers don't have the nerve for a serious consideration of trauma, vengeance, and forgiveness.</Review>
            <Review>The critical problems are an overbusy time-jumping script and reliance on the conventions of the trauma drama - flashbacks, fragmentation, distorted time and space - that prove more a barrier than a window into the character's inner lives.</Review>
            <Review>Beautifully acted, The Railway Man is profoundly moving, and yet, somehow, its sentimental ending manages to be both unearned and predictable.</Review>
            <Review>Why does the movie leave one cold?</Review>
            <Review>The quality of mercy isn't just strained in The Railway Man, it's measured out by the teaspoonful.</Review>
            <Review>The truth of what happened to him is devastating; the truth of how he found forgiveness in his soul is astonishing.</Review>
            <Review>It does its best to honor the unique compassion of the account without succumbing to schmaltz or banal arthouse prestige. The success rate here is a little better than half.</Review>
            <Review>Flicking back and forth in time may not make for a smooth narrative, but the message of forgiveness and reconciliation comes through loud and clear -- this is quite an extraordinary tale.</Review>
            <Review>The Railway Man, meanwhile, leaves you with tears and hope. Hell is over, only when it isn't.</Review>
            <Review>Although the film itself is not exceptional, it tells an important story with a well-articulated message, and for that reason merits attention.</Review>
            <Review>As an Oscar winner for The King's Speech (2010), Firth has nothing to prove. But this is a performance which he might eventually consider to be his finest, speaking volumes for men who quietly carried the burdens of evil on their shoulders.</Review>

            <Review>Berry has proven she's willing to take on enormous challenges, and she certainly exceeds her grasp here. Perhaps that's why Frankie &amp; Alice plays more like an elaborate acting workshop than a movie.</Review>
            <Review>While all this channel-switching and inevitable unearthing of psychic demons generates a great awards-season clip, it doesn't necessarily lead to a satisfying drama.</Review>
            <Review>It may be that this genre has been forever ruined, or just that it requires a more subtle hand than the one exhibited by Geoffrey Sax, the director here.</Review>
            <Review>Lamentably by-the-numbers, treated like an affliction-of-the-week TV movie by its eight (!) credited writers and directed by Geoffrey Sax as if he knew where commercials should go.</Review>
            <Review>It's hard to see beyond Berry's forced mannerisms. She swerves from boogie-dancing tough girl to stoic matron to irritatingly voiced kid.</Review>
            <Review>Modestly engaging, the film is more suited to cable TV and Netflix.</Review>
            <Review>... provides Berry with a diva showcase for plenty of over-the-top emotional outbursts and violent tantrums.</Review>
            <Review>Admittedly a generously apportioned slice of awards-bait pie, but a well-rendered and engaging psychological drama nonetheless, anchored by two solid performances.</Review>
            <Review>It may be based on true events, but it seems more truly inspired by the star-producer's desire for an ostentatious showcase to demonstrate that her Best Actress recognition didn't Jinx (ouch) a career notable for such post-Oscar calamities as 'Catwoman.'</Review>

As students at Yale, they were some of the brightest that the Ivy League had to offer. Not only that, but they were all part of an elite secret society that was carefully guarded from outsiders. Years later, they have all moved on to successful careers. But the opportunity to rationalize who they have become proves impossible to resist. When the time comes for their reunion and the reality of the past finally comes into focus, the group is faced with some troubling truths about their collegiate indiscretions. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>The notion that "love means never having to say you're sorry" sits there bleeding, a stake right through its broken heart.</Review>
            <Review>Pialat compared the structure of We Won't Grow to that of Ravel's "Boléro" for the gradually increasing fortissimo of its subtly varied-yet-repetitious phrases, variations that here show as a gradual shift in the balance of power.</Review>
            <Review>It's intelligent, measured work from the helmer (who adapts his own novel for the screen), easing entrance into a particularly toxic pairing.</Review>
            <Review>The film's emotional and physical violence is startling enough, bluntly realized through Pialat's visual plainspokenness; but his refusal to situate the viewer in time and place has an unsettling effect that's harder to identify.</Review>
            <Review>The apricots, blues and sand of summer gradually incorporate the yellows, rusts and greens of autumn as the relationship slowly dies.</Review>

        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>113</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Present-day college freshman and devout Christian, Josh Wheaton (Shane Harper), finds his faith challenged on his first day of Philosophy class by the dogmatic and argumentative Professor Radisson (Kevin Sorbo). Radisson begins class by informing students that they will need to disavow, in writing, the existence of God on that first day, or face a failing grade. As other students in the class begin scribbling the words "God Is Dead" on pieces of paper as instructed, Josh find himself at a crossroads, having to choose between his faith and his future. Josh offers a nervous refusal, provoking an irate reaction from his smug professor. Radisson assigns him a daunting task: if Josh will not admit that "God Is Dead," he must prove God's existence by presenting well-researched, intellectual arguments and evidence over the course of the semester, and engage Radisson in a head-to-head debate in front of the class. If Josh fails to convince his classmates of God's existence, he will fail the course and hinder his lofty academic goals. With almost no one in his corner, Josh wonders if he can really fight for what he believes. Can he actually prove the existence of God? Wouldn't it just be easier just to write "God Is Dead" and put the whole incident behind him? GOD'S NOT DEAD weaves together multiple stories of faith, doubt and disbelief, culminating in a dramatic call to action. The film will educate, entertain, and inspire moviegoers to explore what they really believe about God, igniting important conversations and life-changing decisions. --(C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>Despite the campus setting, little about the story is intelligently designed.</Review>
            <Review>Even by the rather lax standards of the Christian film industry, God's Not Dead is a disaster.</Review>
            <Review>The film is slickly produced, with a competent cast, and although it sometimes stacks the deck shamelessly in defense of its credo, it does allow a few dissenting voices to slip into the debate.</Review>
            <Review>The Almighty deserves better advocacy than he gets in this typically ham-fisted Christian campus melodrama.</Review>
            <Review>This is awful filmmaking, from trite writing of one-dimensional characters to even triter (which spell-check is telling me is not a word) dialogue.</Review>
            <Review>Will likely get a mildly, if unenthusiastic, passing grade from its target audience, but for the non-believers, it's going to prove a tough and condescending experience.</Review>
            <Review>Has a decided agenda but still manages to be entertaining</Review>
            <Review>Lambasts reason, and celebrates Christianity unabashedly, which is a shame, because it has an opportunity to really challenge its target audience.</Review>

            <Review>I'll Follow You Down is the thinking person's time travel tale, a philosophical drama that poses a what-if question that carries surprising emotional heft.</Review>
            <Review>Mehta doesn't summon the most riveting tale with I'll Follow You Down, but his intentions are pure, striving to rework the subgenre from a more human standpoint.</Review>
            <Review>This sturdy sci-fi drama admirably poses some big questions, but doesn't possess the dramatic firepower to answer them effectively.</Review>
            <Review>Ambitious but clunky, "I'll Follow You Down" is not quite the picture to be Haley Joel Osment's post-adolescent breakthrough, but it is a step in the right direction.</Review>

            <Review>What's missing? A sense of the ineffable.</Review>
            <Review>Oculus, a cleverer-than-average haunted-house movie... speaks to a couple of widespread anxieties-one topical, the other sadly timeless.</Review>
            <Review>"Reaches right through you and chills you to the bone."</Review>
            <Review>As far as competence goes, Oculus doesn't have so little as to be accidentally entertaining or enough to come close to working.</Review>
            <Review>The tension just keeps building as layers of new knowledge, for both the characters and the audience, are acquired.</Review>
            <Review>"Oculus" plays like it went straight to DVD in 2005, its over-reliance on technology as a plot device and distractingly bad hair making it feel instantly dated.</Review>
            <Review>Flanagan effectively turns his inanimate killer very much into an entity that's just as deadly as anything with a pulse- a remarkable feat- all while cleverly concocting an intriguing and complicated tale that isn't afraid to get a little nasty.</Review>
            <Review>Good script, strong cast, several quality scares... yeah, it's actually a decent haunted mirror movie!</Review>
            <Review>Director Mike Flanagan (Absentia) apparently has not been paying attention to the rules of making mainstream horror movies in America, and that's probably why Oculus is one of the best American horror movies in years.</Review>
            <Review>By rooting its clever narrative structure in a tragic story, Flanagan has created a horror that pulls on the heartstrings as often as it grabs you by the throat... Nail-biting, mind-bending and very, very scary, Oculus is a must-see.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Around the Block is the story of American Dino Chalmers (Ricci) - an edgy and charismatic drama teacher with a passion for Shakespeare. When the opportunity arises for her to work at a school in inner Sydney, she embraces the chance to introduce the magical world of theatre as an alternative to life on the tough streets of Redfern in Sydney, Australia. The film centers on the developing relationship between Chalmers and Liam (Page-Lochard), a sixteen-year-old urban Aboriginal student who lives around the block in Redfern and earns the lead in her production of Hamlet. As Chalmers presents Liam with a possibility of a life without drugs and violence, he must choose between pursuing his newfound dream of performing or following his family into a cycle of crime.

            <Review>A short, pungent, ambiguous portrait of the poorer sections of Baltimore and the young men who get their kicks riding dirt bikes through the streets en masse, popping wheelies and dodging the police.</Review>
            <Review>Documentary filmmaker Lotfy Nathan explores the outlaw appeal of an inner-city Baltimore dirt-bike gang through the eyes of a 13-year-old wannabe member named Pug.</Review>
            <Review>It could have romanticized its subjects, portraying them as outlaws and folk heroes. Or it could have gone the way of moral panic. To its credit, [it] does neither of these things - or, rather, it does both, in the most subtle and insightful way possible.</Review>
            <Review>Take a closer look, as Lofty Nathan does in his freewheeling debut feature... and bike gangs like the 12 O'Clock Boys start to differentiate as more than just a dangerous nuisance.</Review>
            <Review>[Pug is] a fiercely individual child, but, inevitably, his predicament also symbolizes how poverty can warp a good boy's nature.</Review>
            <Review>[It] spectacularizes black criminality for white middle-class viewers, the primary audience for the festivals and art houses where this film will have its career.</Review>
            <Review>The filmmaking on 12 O'Clock Boys is masterfully even-handed and fastidiously detailed.</Review>
            <Review>This defiance of the law, combined with the skill, speed and excitement, is part of the romance that draws Pug and other kids into the biker life. It is like the wild west.</Review>
            <Review>The result is evocative and compelling, even if it doesn't offer much context or socioeconomic insight into its broader subject.</Review>
            <Review>There's no balance of perspective, but what the feature lacks in fullness it makes up for in pure energy, extracting a sense of life in motion as its influence by a false sense of security.</Review>
            <Review>For a first-time filmmaker, Nathan achieves a remarkable balance, presenting each side with very little bias.</Review>
            <Review>One of the more unique looks at the Other America to come down the line in recent years</Review>

        <Duration>83</Duration>
        <StoryLine>In our time, an equally compelling presence roams the streets of New York armed with only a camera: Matt Weber. There is no telling how many stories Weber has attempted to capture since he first started taking pictures out of the window of the cab he used to drive. But his quarter century-plus devotion to candidly depicting the lives of his fellow New Yorkers, many of them from the fringes of society, has yielded a remarkable document of a New York that most of us will never experience. Part character study and part meditation on photography, MORE THAN THE RAINBOW interweaves live action, still photography and revealing interviews with Weber and fellow photographers. Shot on both hi-def video and in 35mm, and largely scored to the music of Thelonious Monk, this beautiful and evocative documentary is a poetic celebration of the world's greatest city and the individuals who walk its streets.

            <Review>The amount of fun a cast and crew have while making a movie rarely translates to the final product, but that's not the case here.</Review>
            <Review>What is most surprising about Need For Speed is how badly it starts off. With too much exposition and not enough spark between the characters, it's as if the overlong 130-minute film will live up to its title for all of the wrong reasons.</Review>

            <Review>Dorado proves nimble at chase scenes, and the ending is immensely satisfying: not impossible to predict, per se, but probably the third or fourth possible outcome you imagined.</Review>

            <Review>There is nothing particularly fresh about "Anna," from its script to its direction to its cast.</Review>
            <Review>Farmiga stands out in an otherwise rote and thrill-neutral tale of a psychic gumshoe.</Review>
            <Review>... takes a moderately intriguing concept and drowns it amid contrivances and clichés, along with a series of plot twists that gradually become more outrageous than suspenseful.</Review>

            <Review>The title's promise of violence is dutifully met in gory, sonically squishy close-quarter melees shot in Confuse-o-vision, as if the camera had been strapped to a whirring blender before the footage was edited with the puree button.</Review>
            <Review>Essentially 108 minutes of woad-daubed Scots and begrimed English settlers slogging it out over a castle on the Scottish border in 1221.</Review>
            <Review>Battle for Blood is ultimately too accurate a subtitle; this film is a bloodbath, and not an edifying one in the slightest.</Review>
            <Review>Much sound and fury ensues, but without a compelling story behind it, it signifies very little.</Review>
            <Review>Despite too much jerky camera work, 'Ironclad 2' boasts lots of action and a stirring background score. Plus, its cup runneth over with medieval blood and gore.</Review>
            <Review>It throws historical accuracy out the window even more than its predecessor.</Review>
            <Review>Battle for Blood continues to make 13th-century England look like a truly wretched place to live or, more often, die in. But while it delivers some strong battle sequences, the characters are less vividly drawn than in its predecessor.</Review>
            <Review>...a grisly, humorless, tension-free, badly shot slog of a sorta-sequel.</Review>
            <Review>Attempting to cover up production constraints, English makes Battle for Blood visually worthless at times, which doesn't help the picture's ongoing fatigue as it gradually runs out of shock value and fascinating characters.</Review>
            <Review>It has the feel of a follow up that English either helmed so no one else could or was desperate to make, despite a lack of interest from financiers and agents.</Review>
            <Review>The director manages to deliver a commendable production on what appears to be little budget.</Review>
            <Review>What should have been a quick, exciting medieval skirmish starts to feel like the 100 Years War.</Review>

            <Review>It's all pretty dumb, and it marks a career low for director Neil Burger, who's made some first-class indie dramas from his own scripts.</Review>
            <Review>The first film adapted from Veronica Roth's generically dystopian book series arrives with a sludgy, gray-hued plop.</Review>
            <Review>The climactic chases, shootouts, and fistfights have been staged, filmed, and edited with insobriety. Visual clarity shouldn't be too much to ask from these movies, even if they fail to achieve ideological coherence.</Review>
            <Review>Jackhammer music and sound design are all that hold the action scenes together.</Review>
            <Review>If you can forget what it's saying, Divergent is fairly entertaining.</Review>
            <Review>Trust me when I say that, for some reason, stick with the saga in the event that the sequels will all materialise, because the ultimate pay off when you discover what it's all for will be definitely worth it.</Review>
            <Review>The pic's charismatic cast turns the skeletal narrative into something functional, making for a surprisingly pleasant ride.</Review>
            <Review>It may be totally predictable and just a tad overlong and overdone, but Divergent is a far better foray into YA territory than Vampire Academy, or even The Host.</Review>
            <Review>Rather than concentrate on environment and character development, it spends two-thirds of its runtime forgetting it needs an ending.</Review>
            <Review>It's really just an elaborate metaphor for Being Your Own Beautiful Self, which apparently goes over well with readers of a certain tender age.</Review>
            <Review>... a journey that puts (Tris), her family, and the entire 23rd century in danger before Buck Rogers can get back to save it.</Review>

        <Title>Profils Paysans: la Vie Moderne (Modern Life)</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2008</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>88</Duration>
        <StoryLine>After offering an up-close look at life in a farming community in the French hillsides in Profils paysans: L'approche and Le Quotidien, filmmaker Raymond Depardon returns to the village of Le Villaret in this documentary. Marcel Privat and his brother Raymond Privat have spent nearly their whole lives as dairy farmers in Le Villaret, but it's clear they can only continue for so long; Marcel is eighty-eight years old while his brother is only a few years younger, and unfavorable weather and poor soil conditions have devastated their grazing lands, reducing their flocks to a handful of cows and goats. Their nephew Alain Rouviere has moved from Calais to Le Villaret to help look after Marcel and Raymond as well as their farm, but it's clear Alain's wife Cecile doesn't care for the old men and isn't afraid to tell them what she thinks. Down the road, Marcel Challaye and his wife Germaine are also growing old and fighting a losing battle with the elements as their spread of cattle gradually shrinks to nothingness, and Daniel Roy, who has inherited his family's farm, sees no future in working the increasingly flinty soil of Le Villaret. La Vie Moderne (aka Modern Life) was an official entry at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi</StoryLine>

            <Review>Depardon's palpable sense of respect for his subjects lends the film a geniality that would otherwise have been hard to fabricate.</Review>
            <Review>This could be the most sublime film you'll ever see about French cattle farming.</Review>
            <Review>The interviews aren't that insightful, but they have a simple poignancy.</Review>
            <Review>It's an austere, rewarding film.</Review>
            <Review>Though visually seductive, especially for anyone longing to escape the urban jungle, Modern Life is also to be admired for refusing to slide into postcard lyricism.</Review>
            <Review>Visually evocative and deeply moving on the theme of the deterioration of an ancient way of rural life.</Review>
            <Review>A low-key but genuinely insightful journey through a vanishing way of life.</Review>
            <Review>The pastoral beauty of the scenery and the lyrical journey of Depardon's camera are underscored by a sense of acute melancholy and hopelessness in this affecting film.</Review>
            <Review>There is a richness of fellow-feeling and lack of condescension in Raymond Depardon's study of rural farmers in the remote French countryside.</Review>
            <Review>These are private people whose every careworn expression tells a story. It's during their silences that we see the real, human cost of progress.</Review>
            <Review>The beautifully shot Modern Life is a richly compassionate tribute to its hardy subjects and their slowly vanishing way of life.</Review>
            <Review>Progress has always been cruel, modernity murderous. But that brute reality doesn't mean we cannot pause, with Depardon, to mourn and commemorate.</Review>

            <Review>Maja Milos's aggressive and upsetting first film ...</Review>
            <Review>The Dutch were not wrong in awarding it for its bravery, but the old maxim of whether the glass is half full or empty takes on a whole new meaning with Clip because the glass is shattered into pieces too small for reconstruction.</Review>
            <Review>This gritty Serbian character drama has audacity and attitude to spare, yet lacks sufficient emotional resonance beneath its sexually explicit surface.</Review>
            <Review>Unflinching, raw and bold with emotional complexity.</Review>
            <Review>A raw, sophisticated, and stomach-turning look at what it means to be a young woman in Serbia, what it means to be a woman tout court.</Review>
            <Review>Though their stories have very little in common, Clip and Death of a Man in the Balkans are both strongly keyed to a nation's modern identity.</Review>

Nazanin Boniadi plays Shirin, an absent-minded, young Iranian-American living in "Tehrangeles" (the large Iranian community in Los Angeles) with her overbearing mother and empathetic father. Despite being engaged for years to a successful Iranian plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills, Shirin finds herself breaking loyalty and tradition when she falls in love with a mysterious young man who lives in a lighthouse in northern California. As her secret unravels and cultures clash, Shirin discovers what it ultimately means to be true to herself.(c) Sideshow Releasing</StoryLine>

            <Review>Although Boniadi makes Shirin nearly as likable as she's supposed to be, writer- director Ramin Niami's movie is crudely contrived and sloppily edited.</Review>

            <Review>The only possible reaction to an amateurish romance like "Shirin in Love" is: Do the filmmakers think we're all idiots?</Review>

        <Duration>104</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Boss Suchart is the influential owner of a major elephant camp. When he was murdered in his own home - the killer delivered three fatal blows on his body - all evidence points to KHAM (Tony Jaa), who was present at the crime scene and was seen with the victim the moment before he died. Kham is forced to run as the police launch a pursuit. Meanwhile, the twin nieces of Boss Suchart (Jija Yanin Wismitanan and Teerada Kittisiriprasert) are out for revenge. But luck is on Kham's side when he runs into Sergeant MARK (Mum Jokmok), an Interpol agent sent to Thailand on a secret mission. As Kham is hunted by several parties, he's also desperately searching for KHON, his elephant, whose disappearance is involved with Boss Suchart's death. In another twist, Kham is drawn into an underground fighting ring run by LC (RZA), a crime lord who's obsessed with collecting top-class martial artists from around the world. LC's fighters are branded only by numbers, such as the lethal, beautiful TWENTY (Ratha Pho-ngam) and the diabolical NO.2 (Marrese Crump). These fighters are ordered to defeat and capture Kham for a special mission that LC has in mind. A sequel of the global smash-hit The Protector (Tom Yam Goong), THE PROTECTOR 2 is an extreme fight movie, an endlessly intense, nerve-racking film full of fists, elbows, kicks and daredevil stunt scenes and amazingly choreographed fighting moves that will pump hot blood through the body of all action fans.(C) Magnolia</StoryLine>

        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>82</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Eliza Hittman's powerful debut feature tells the story of Lila (Gina Piersanti, in a stunning debut), a fourteen year old spending a hot summer in a blue-collar Brooklyn neighborhood far removed from the bustling city. Awkward, lonely, and often playing the third wheel, Lila is determined to emulate the sexual exploits of her more experienced best friend. She fixates on Sammy, a tough older guy, when she hears that "he'll sleep with anyone." Deluded in her romantic pursuit, Lila tries desperately to insert herself into Sammy's gritty world, but in doing so she puts herself into a dangerously vulnerable situation. (C) Variance</StoryLine>

            <Review>In Gina Piersanti, also making her feature debut, Hittman has found the perfect actress to portray the difficult undertaking of growing up, or at least trying to.</Review>
            <Review>Hittman draws attention to the pervasive cultural forces (rap music, Internet pornography, suggestive dancing on TV) that present young girls as sexual objects, making the scenes of exploitation seem sadly inevitable.</Review>
            <Review>Rarely has the zone between girlhood and womanhood been captured with such urgent honesty than in Eliza Hittman's superb teen drama "It Felt Like Love."</Review>
            <Review>"It Felt Like Love" doesn't just unreel before your eyes, it weighs on you.</Review>
            <Review>It's easy to be seduced by the loosely observational vibe of the movie, even as its tale of a shrinking violet struggling not to be a late bloomer fails to strike more than a single note of dismay.</Review>
            <Review>Gorgeously shot in Brooklyn's beachfront neighborhoods and devoid of easy sentimentality, "It Felt Like Love" features realistic performances all around, understandable given the cast of mostly first-time actors.</Review>
            <Review>It Felt Like Love is Hittman's first credited feature, and when it begins to slow, one can tell that she is perhaps still navigating the transition from short to full-length.</Review>
            <Review>[Hittman's] offbeat visual style ... helps put you inside the mind of the lead character, for whom nothing is clear.</Review>
            <Review>Hittman wraps her pointed agenda in a deceptively lovely tone poem about adolescence and summer, almost impressionistic in its evocation of the raging hormones of the teenage years.</Review>
            <Review>It's neither overly sentimental nor obnoxiously cautionary.</Review>
            <Review>First-time feature filmmaker Hittman, working with the talented DP Sean Porter, has a natural way with visuals that communicates the curiosity running rabid through the blood of summer-idle teenagers.</Review>
            <Review>The scenes between Lila, Sammy, and Sammy's macho friends feature some of Hittman's most acute dialogue and direction.</Review>

        <StoryLine>The coming of age tale of an extraordinarily gifted young dancer recently arrived in New York City, Five Dances is a visually sensual glimpse of life and first love in the downtown contemporary dance world. Shooting mostly in and around a Soho dance studio, with original dance by the internationally renowned choreographer Jonah Bokaer, writer/director Alan Brown (Private Romeo, Superheroes, Book of Love) and his cast of five of New York's most talented dancers capture the emotional turbulence and creative excitement of a small dance company during the process of creation. Introducing Ryan Steele (Newsies, West Side Story) in an exciting film debut. (c)Paladin</StoryLine>

            <Review>A lovingly shot valentine to work and body and art, and a generous, ultimately happy little story of a lost boy finding a community and a kindred soul.</Review>
            <Review>Five Dances should well impress dance aficionados even if its skimpy narrative proves less than inspired.</Review>
            <Review>Rather than adapting the pieces to conform to his paper-thin narrative, Brown explores the tensions and contortions of dancers expressing fresh emotion through a pre-existing art form.</Review>
            <Review>Just when the plotting had me sighing with impatience, Brown would get back into showing us rehearsal and things would liven up again. It's in the recording of dance that this movie comes alive.</Review>
            <Review>There's an interesting vibe there, but it's not enough to save what seems like a failed experiment.</Review>
            <Review>Though the film's untested cast struggles with the drama, and the sketched-out story is often banal (there are several amateurish calls-to-mom scenes), the presentation of a specific city subculture is etched from the heart.</Review>
            <Review>At times the plot seems to exist merely to string together all these dance scenes ... Unfortunately, Five Dances feels more interested in the art than the artist.</Review>
            <Review>Anyone not associated with the world of modern dance and/or anyone not fixated on the bodies of agile young men will find little of interest in this slow, claustrophobic film</Review>
            <Review>It's the moments when the director stops worrying about clarifying plot and character motivation and lets the performances bring those into being that makes this an authentic project.</Review>
            <Review>Unfortunately, schmaltzy music and drab melodrama drag down the otherwise graceful moves of Five Dances.</Review>

            <Review>It's not a bad gimmick, but the movie turns tediously sentimental fast.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately, the film rides on Frost, who carries it with charm, grace and plenty of heart.</Review>
            <Review>It ends up feeling a little like warmed-over Strictly Ballroom without Baz Lurhmann's over-the-top sense of style.</Review>
            <Review>I don't know about you, but anything done with an English accent usually seems all the more tolerable for it.</Review>
            <Review>A little more fury might have been a whole lot better.</Review>
            <Review>Cuban Fury mostly delivers the kind of funny, silly and delightful comedy as you'd expect from something "based on an original idea" by Nick Frost.</Review>
            <Review>Nick Frost delivers one of the great physical performances of the modern cinema era. Sexually, though, [Cuban Fury] is inexplicably playing for a decidedly 'adult humour' audience, thus eliminating ( ... ) family audiences.</Review>
            <Review>Being about 70% romantic-comedy and 30% quirky underdog sports movie, to call the plot of Cuban Fury predictable would be an understatement.</Review>
            <Review>If "Cuban Fury" launches Frost into bigger and better films, it's worth it.</Review>
            <Review>"Luckily, (Nick Frost has) still got enough charm to make most of us overlook the more far-fetched and dumber story elements. And surprisingly, he's fleet of foot enough to be able to pull off some pretty tricky moves and sequences."</Review>
            <Review>Doesn't have a personality of its own, in dire need of a more robust collection of laughs and a few less painfully contrived subplots.</Review>

            <Review>What begins as a smoothly oiled romantic comedy quickly morphs into a clattery, grinding screwball contrivance.</Review>
            <Review>The vapid story -- and its intended humor -- meanders and loses its way in predictable sit-com style.</Review>
            <Review>For all its faults, there is a kind of genius in the way that it takes the rom-com raison d'etre - the desire to see two lovable people fall in love with each other - and diverts it for its own purposes.</Review>
            <Review>You can't shake the feeling that in a just world, all these women - even Kate Upton - would have better material than this.</Review>
            <Review>Brutal.</Review>
            <Review>No one knows which takes are funny and which aren't. More than once, all three women, especially poor Upton, are caught looking like they don't know what they're doing.</Review>
            <Review>Kate Upton busts out in buoyant debut turn.</Review>
            <Review>One of those lame comedies that pretends allegiance to the female demographic but spends most of its time toiling around in sub-moronic, playground-level sexual politics.</Review>
            <Review>Though Nine to Five played out as an ensemble film, The Other Woman is totally taken over by Mann, who swipes every scene with her hilariously sympathetic portrayal of a needy, ditzy, and slightly manic wife.</Review>
            <Review>This is one of the blandest films of the week.</Review>
            <Review>While there are a few solidly funny moments, The Other Woman is largely an extended groan.</Review>
            <Review>This could have been a crowd-pleasing tale of female solidarity and revenge along the lines of Nine to Five. Instead, thanks to tissue-thin characters, lame slapstick and excrementally bad gross-out comedy, it proves to be a glossy mess.</Review>

            <Review>Biyi Bandele has excerpted their story from a much wider-ranging narrative, but the action here is still so tightly compressed that this feels like a precis for a movie twice its length.</Review>
            <Review>The best of the movie finds a way to abridge the novel and still allow the scenes to breathe.</Review>
            <Review>Like many a lengthy novel, it might have worked better as a television series.</Review>
            <Review>"Half of a Yellow Sun" winds up being one of those movies in which a pesky event of great historical import keeps getting in the way of a soap-opera romance.</Review>
            <Review>The result is that melodramatic soap opera elements win out over Bandele's attempts at stirring historical drama. That said, it's still a story worth telling.</Review>
            <Review>"Half of a Yellow Sun" deals with human tragedy, but it never really makes a human connection.</Review>
            <Review>The plot goes everywhere and nowhere, coming across as a disconnected series of events rather than a unified whole. Ejiofor and Newton offer solid but unexceptional performances, as though hampered by the director's lack of vision.</Review>
            <Review>The actors shine: Thandie Newton, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Anika Noni Rose are all splendidly in their moment.</Review>

            <Review>A well-intentioned historical drama that gets caught up in the undertow of mawkish melodrama early on, never to fully recover.</Review>
            <Review>The audience's attachment to and investment in these people lend powerful intimacy to the large scale epic trappings.</Review>

            <Review>The film oscillates between glitzy existential horror and somber showbiz spectacle.</Review>
            <Review>In a single sequence, Aronofsky combines creationism, Darwinian evolution, original sin, the end of days, and radical environmentalism.</Review>
            <Review>For all the high-tech showmanship on display, this retelling of Noah and the Ark marks a serious effort to engage with the Old Testament as a literary text.</Review>
            <Review>In some ways, Noah resembles one of those Kirk Cameron movies about the apocalypse, only with a better cast and more dazzling special effects.</Review>
            <Review>Rock Transformers.</Review>
            <Review>It's overlong and a times sluggish. The fights and battles, designed to give an epic fantasy feel to the movie, are grave miscalculations. And the overabundance of CGI often makes Noah look like a video game.</Review>
            <Review>Gruff and gentle, skilled with a blade and tormented by his visions, Russell Crowe proves yet again that no one anchors an epic as well as he.</Review>
            <Review>It's as odd and schizophrenic a picture as you're likely to see in the focus-grouped, play-it-safe moviemaking climate of the moment, and the fact that it exists at all is sort of a (ha ha) miracle.</Review>
            <Review>Noah isn't perfect, but in its flawed, trembling beauty it's more interesting than much of Hollywood's recent tentpole output.</Review>
            <Review>(Director) Aronofsky has crafted one firecracker of an adventure film with spectacular effects, vast warring armies and a disaster scenario for the ages. And at its center is a splendid performance by Crowe.</Review>
            <Review>As misguided a film as you're likely to see from a genuinely great filmmaker.</Review>
            <Review>It explores concepts like grace, justice, pride, guilt, and love. It respects its source material and respects the power of human imagination. It takes a sober look at the evil in the human heart. That is the sort of movie worth watching.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Frontier scout Jess Remsberg (James Garner) is crossing the desert when he spots a dead army scout and group of Apaches pursuing someone -- it turns out to be a white woman, Ellen Grange (Bibi Andersson); he gets her away from them and returns her to her home and her husband Willard (Dennis Weaver), who seems much more upset that the horse she was riding when she left is dead than he is glad that she is back. Ellen was kidnapped by the Apaches two years before and rescued a year after that, and had fled a town where her husband and everyone else had treated her as an outcast since her return. Apart from preventing her from being raped by some drunken townsmen, however, Remsberg barely has time to worry over what goes on between them, as he has a mission of his own -- tracking down the men who murdered his wife, a Comanche woman. A key clue is in the hands of the town marshal in Fort Conchos and to get there he has to scout for a cavalry unit bringing horses, ammunition, and fresh recruits to the fort, with Grange and his wife -- and the infant son she had by the Indian chieftain who took her as his squaw -- going along, with ex-buffalo soldier-turned-horse wrangler Toler (Sidney Poitier). Their party ends up under siege by Chata (John Hoyt), the Apache Indian chief and grandfather to Ellen Grange's baby, who has jumped the reservation; he wants his grandson back, and the ammunition the troop was carrying, and also intends on killing Ellen for inadvertently causing the death of his son. They all end up trapped in a box canyon while Remsberg tries to survive to get help from Fort Conchos. If this all sounds complicated, it's not, especially as told by director Nelson, in a straightforward, unpretentious, brisk, and decidedly violent fashion that anticipates his own Soldier Blue, made four years later. Every plot element links up neatly in this script, which quite effectively recalls (and weaves together) elements of the book and the movie Hondo as well as any number of revenge westerns of the 1960's. ~ Bruce Eder, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <Title>The French Minister</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>113</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Alexandre Taillard de Vorms is tall and impressive, a man with style, attractive to women. He also happens to be the Minister of Foreign Affairs for the land of enlightenment: France. With his silver mane and tanned, athletic body, he stalks the world stage, from the floor of the United Nations in New York to the powder keg of Oubanga. There, he calls on the powerful and invokes the mighty to bring peace, to calm the trigger-happy, and to cement his aura of Nobel Peace Prize winner-in-waiting. Alexandre Taillard de Vorms is a force to be reckoned with, waging his own war backed up by the holy trinity of diplomatic concepts: legitimacy, lucidity and efficacy. He takes on American neo-cons, corrupt Russians and money-grabbing Chinese. Perhaps the world doesn't deserve France's magnanimousness, but his art would be wasted if just restricted to home turf. Enter the young Arthur Vlaminck, graduate of the elite National School of Administration, who is hired as head of "language" at the foreign ministry. In other words, he is to write the minister's speeches. But he also has to learn to deal with the sensibilities of the boss and his entourage, and find his way between the private secretary and the special advisors who stalk the corridors of the Quai d'Orsay - the ministry's home - where stress, ambition and dirty dealing are the daily currency. But just as he thinks he can influence the fate of the world, everything seems threatened by the inertia of the technocrats. (C) IFC Films</StoryLine>

            <Review>There are enough moments of inspired lunacy to make this worthwhile.</Review>
            <Review>The films of Bertrand Tavernier have often been fringed with humor, of a rueful kind; now, in his seventies, and in a rousing rebuke to tranquillity, he has turned to farce.</Review>
            <Review>Maybe the problem is that Tavernier has made a French comedy-but not a very universal one.</Review>
            <Review>Mr. Tavernier's filmmaking here is loose, almost casual, and you may not always notice what he's doing with the camera as he frames the ministry's choreographed chaos with its whirling people and parts.</Review>
            <Review>In the first comedy of a 40-year career that includes A Sunday in the Country and The Princess of Montpensier, director and co-writer Bertrand Tavernier tries to do too much.</Review>
            <Review>It's pleasant, and at times very funny, but the meandering episodes mean that despite the long running time, the satire never builds to a payoff.</Review>
            <Review>I think what I liked best is the way that Tavernier makes the film about Arthur's sentimental education and the universal tendency to dismiss politics as a triumph of style over substance.</Review>
            <Review>What the film is really missing, though, is a character like Malcolm Tucker. Without an angry Scotsman threatening to punch people into paralysis, the humour feels decidedly toothless.</Review>
            <Review>If you're not looking for something that puts politics to the sword, but merely uses it to provide a backdrop for some gently prodding humour,The French Minister will provide a chuckle or two.</Review>
            <Review>Some of its references might be arcane but most are not, and its sly, satirical depiction of power has universal appeal.</Review>
            <Review>Other than Tavernier's odd decision to draw Taillard de Worms with broad strokes, while sketching the remaining ensemble with considerable nuance, The French Minister has one big barrier to audiences who don't speak French: There are too many words.</Review>
            <Review>Much of "The French Minister" is enjoyably brisk, Tavernier moving his camera and actors around the ministry's cramped offices and corridors with speed and grace.</Review>

        <Duration>81</Duration>
        <StoryLine>After receiving a grant for her graduate thesis, Elizabeth Benton (Melanie Papalia) logs onto a video-chat site known as THE DEN, on a mission to explore the habits of its users. During one of her random video-chats, Elizabeth watches in horror as a teenage girl is gruesomely murdered in front of her webcam. While the police dismiss it as a viral prank, Elizabeth believes what she saw is real and takes it upon herself to find the truth. Her life quickly spirals out of control as she gets pulled deeper into the darkest recesses of the internet. And eventually, Elizabeth finds herself trapped in a twisted game in which she and her loved ones are targeted for the same grisly fate as the first victim. (c) IFC Films</StoryLine>

            <Review>Zach Donohue's debut feature ingeniously uses only computer images to tell its tale.</Review>
            <Review>False leads superfluously string the protagonist along; it feels as though the writers have padded the script rather than showed off their cleverness.</Review>
            <Review>There are almost no real shocks or scares to rattle you out of the stupor that inevitably develops from observing someone else fiddle with their laptop for much of the running time.</Review>
            <Review>Scenes pulse with the Internet's speed and sprawl, aided by clever editing that pops.</Review>
            <Review>The Den's commitment to its presentational conceit leads to a number of implausible scenarios, but what's more disheartening is the gore-fest it turns into once the curtain is thrown back on the mystery propelling both Elizabeth and the narrative.</Review>
            <Review>The film is neither compelling or innovative enough to justify sitting through its torture porn-y moments.</Review>
            <Review>It's mean-spirted, vicious and twistedly entertaining, the kind of film that will make you think twice about being left alone and vulnerable in front of your laptop.</Review>
            <Review>...a superior found-footage endeavor that's often as unnerving as it is timely.</Review>
            <Review>The results are a paranoid thrill ride into twenty-first century manipulation and exploitation, a pseudo snuff film whose very making we witness, and whose impact comes from our awareness of its chilling plausibility.</Review>
            <Review>taps into contemporary anxieties about both the very public nature - and anonymity - of the lives that we lead online, building towards a sadistic, cynical ending</Review>
            <Review>Cowriter (with Lauren Thompson)/director Zachary Donohue puts a new spin on the 'found footage' genre with this incredibly clever and creepy film that delves into our worst online fears.</Review>
            <Review>"The Den" is unsettling without being excessively gory, building legitimate dread rather than resorting to cheap scares.</Review>

        <Title>Crazy Horse</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2012</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>134</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Inside Paris's Crazy Horse cabaret - the most famous nude dance show in the world. Acclaimed documentary filmmaker Frederick Wiseman explores one of the most mythic and colorful places dedicated to women, the Crazy Horse - a legendary Parisian cabaret club, founded in 1951 by Alain Bernardin. Over the years it has become the Parisian nightlife 'must' for visitors, ranking alongside the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre. Wiseman's impeccable eye finds the Crazy Horse a uniquely French showcase, with an emphasis on elegance, perfectionism and a grueling schedule (2 shows a night and 3 on Saturdays, 7 days a week). The film shows us the rehearsals for and the unveiling of the brand new show - D�sir - created by the renowned French choreographer Phillippe Decoufle. -- (C) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>Crazy Horse could be condensed to its advantage.</Review>
            <Review>The idea is to be erotic, seductive, but often, through Wiseman's unforgiving lens, the effect is more anatomical, aloof, amusing.</Review>
            <Review>If there's one thing that's both surprising and predictable about "Crazy Horse" it's how thoroughly unsexy the film is.</Review>
            <Review>Wiseman is a still-prolific luminary of what has been dubbed "direct cinema," a documentary style in which the director intrudes as little as possible and conducts no on-camera interviews.</Review>
            <Review>If nothing else, you'll surely relish the extravagant rhetoric used by Ali Mahdavi, the club's artistic director, to describe what is basically a tasteful nudie revue.</Review>
            <Review>The most interesting dynamic exists between director Philippe Decoufle and artistic director Ali Mahdavi.</Review>
            <Review>Ultimately, this is interesting filmmaking, but Wiseman's ultra-orthodox methods may put off viewers who are used to more interactive documentaries.</Review>
            <Review>The movie might as well be about the Burger King down the road, considering that it tells us virtually nothing about this legendary Parisian club.</Review>
            <Review>Wiseman's camera seems to be unabashedly enjoying the garish spectacle it's taking in, while at the same time offering an implicit critique of the narrow definition of beauty and the commodification of flesh embodied by the Crazy Horse aesthetic.</Review>
            <Review>Take away the nude women, and the office politics are pretty familiar.</Review>
            <Review>There's a distinct lack of real-world tension in this particular Wiseman subject.</Review>
            <Review>Wiseman's film captivates, like all backstage documentaries, with its instances of the banal ensconced amid so much fleshly and artistic perfection.</Review>

        <StoryLine>A modern-day Joan of Arc takes to the road in this unusual teen story. Helen Slater stars as Billy Jean Davy, the pretty older sister of the mischievous Binx (Christian Slater). When Binx's beloved motor-scooter gets trashed by the spoiled son of a local shop owner, Billy Jean demands payment for the damage. Smarmy shop owner Pyatt (Richard Bradford) agrees, only to lure Billy Jean to an upstairs room where he attempts to rape her. Injuring Pyatt, the brother- and sister-duo go on the run with some trailer-park friends, cutting across Texas while making a name for themselves as local heroes. Implausible at every turn, the film is memorable though for Helen Slater's spunky performance.</StoryLine>

            <Review>It should have been made 40 years ago, but this biopic about the Mexican-American leader who spearheaded the fight for farmworkers' rights couldn't be more timely.</Review>
            <Review>Cesar Chavez makes for a fine history lesson, but as drama, it leaves something to be desired.</Review>
            <Review>Michael Peña brings a centered, beckoning beauty to the title character that manages to speak to Chávez nonviolent approach without becoming hagiographic.</Review>
            <Review>Biopics about civil rights icons are usually staid affairs. Cesar Chavez, directed by Diego Luna, is no exception.</Review>
            <Review>With Peña, the question is this: Are the movies brave enough to give him the chance he deserves? He's a wonderful Cesar Chavez.</Review>
            <Review>It's reverential rather than revealing, predictably admiring where it needs to be nuanced and challenging.</Review>
            <Review>Basically, if you need a history lesson, 'Cesar Chavez' is not a bad way to go. We need histories of heroes. However, you can find more history on Wikipedia.</Review>
            <Review>For better or worse, the film is a call to action, but I want to know more.</Review>
            <Review>Cesar Chavez is perhaps an abridged history lesson, but given the amount of material it needed to convey, it does a commendable and stirring job.</Review>
            <Review>While Cesar Chavez was an important figure in the fight for farmworkers' rights, a film adaptation of his work simply doesn't make for a very compelling experience, especially when it doesn't deliver the emotional impact that it should.</Review>
            <Review>Truncated bio-pic doesn't dig deep</Review>
            <Review>Labor struggles and mass movements are the most difficult to pull off in this strictly status quo society, and the same could be said for movies re-enacting any of that suppressed US history. But this heroic and healing yet candid biopic does just that.</Review>

He endlessly listens to music, reads books and looks out the window to oversee the roofs of neighboring houses in Harlem. Nothing breaks his monotonous loneliness except for the visits of two helpers - a young Russian woman-social worker and a young black man-home attendant - who merely do their duties. But in Mr. Brown's imagination they all have a passionate affair. He feels that the home attendant loves the social worker but is very jealous of her because she is madly in love with her subject - Mr. Brown, and Mr. Brown himself is in love with the home attendant-boy. These "relationships" develop gradually over continuous visits of two helpers. And in Mr. Brown's world their passion is expressed through the dance. Unable to withstand the energy of love and possession Mr. Brown "kills" the home attendant and sinks into a prison of his loneliness and wheel chair.</StoryLine>

A DECADE AFTER THAT HUMILIATING NIGHT, THEY REMAIN ROOTED TO THE BOTTOM OF FIFA'S WORLD RANKINGS, HAVING SCORED ONLY TWICE IN SEVENTEEN YEARS. THEY HAVE LOST EVERY COMPETITIVE GAME THEY HAVE EVER PLAYED. AGAINST THIS BACKDROP OF SERIAL UNDERACHIEVEMENT, THE TEAM FACE THE DAUNTING PROSPECT OF A QUALIFICATION CAMPAIGN FOR THE UPCOMING 2014 WORLD CUP IN BRAZIL. IT WOULD TAKE A MIRACLE-MAKER OR A MADMAN TO TURN THE TEAM'S FORTUNES AROUND - AND IN MAVERICK DUTCH COACH THOMAS RONGEN THE ISLANDERS SOMEHOW FIND BOTH. AS A LOAN APPOINTMENT FROM THE MIGHTY U.S. SOCCER FEDERATION, WITH EXPERIENCE OF PLAYING ALONGSIDE FOOTBALL GREATS LIKE GEORGE BEST AND JOHANN CRUYFF, RONGEN IS COMPLETELY UNPREPARED FOR WHAT GREETS HIM ON THE ISLAND - IN HIS OWN WORDS IT IS "BY FAR THE LOWEST STANDARD" OF FOOTBALL HE'S EVER SEEN, WITH ONLY HALF OF HIS TEAM EVEN FIT ENOUGH TO PLAY A WHOLE GAME. A LACK OF ATHLETICISM TO ONE SIDE, THOMAS' AILING SQUAD CONTAINS THE EMOTIONALLY SCARRED GOALKEEPER WHO CONCEDED 31 GOALS AGAINST AUSTRALIA A DECADE EARLIER AND A MEMBER OF SAMOA'S THIRD GENDER, THE FA'FAFINE, WHO LIVES 24/7 AS A WOMAN. TO COMPLICATE MATTERS FURTHER THE TEAM'S BEST PLAYER HAS BEEN POSTED 6000 MILES AWAY BY THE US MILITARY. WITH THE TEAM ABOUT TO EMBARK ON A GRUELLING WORLD CUP QUALIFICATION CAMPAIGN, RONGEN HAS JUST ONE MONTH TO TRANSFORM THIS RAGTAG OF LOSERS INTO A WINNING TEAM - AND PERHAPS LEARN A LITTLE ABOUT HIMSELF ALONG THE WAY.(c) Official Site</StoryLine>

            <Review>A schmaltz opera that indulges Robin Williams' most melancholy tics and themes.</Review>
            <Review>The film never quite manages to figure out what it's actually about.</Review>
            <Review>Williams, of course, has been doing a gruff-turns-to-lovable schtick as opposed to any organic acting for more than half of his motion picture career, so his work here is what one might call dreadfully predictable.</Review>
            <Review>The movie is predictably sentimental at its root, but it's also meant to be comedy, partly resting on Mr. Williams's energetic but failed attempt to play a jerk.</Review>
            <Review>Every scene between two people comes off like drunkenly shot video of a play rehearsal gone horribly wrong.</Review>
            <Review>Considering its outlandish premise, what the film lacks are any outlandish scenes-or, if not outlandish, then at least ones in the realm of the creative.</Review>
            <Review>The Angriest Man in Brooklyn is like a brilliant clown stumbling off stage accompanied by a kazoo.</Review>
            <Review>The message of the movie is not to waste the time you're given. That includes watching movies as bad as this one.</Review>
            <Review>Tonally and creatively messy, and filled with entirely too much shouting. In the case of "The Angriest Man in Brooklyn," less would have been much, much more.</Review>
            <Review>"The Angriest Man in Brooklyn" is a film that's never sure which way it wants to lean, leading to a very confused tone for a movie that has nothing original to offer in its cliché-filled storyline.</Review>
            <Review>"The Angriest Man in Brooklyn" doesn't seem to know what chord to strike: it veers wildly from madcap farce to social satire to sentimental family drama.</Review>

            <Review>Eye-opening, compelling and accessible to the laymen.</Review>
            <Review>Recognizing that minds are changed as much through the heart as a litany of facts, GMO OMG manages to provoke important self-reflection in viewers.</Review>
            <Review>With the cinematography and its family-centric approach, it takes what could have been a dry subject and broadens its appeal.</Review>
            <Review>In this unsatisfying home movie meets documentary hybrid, filmmaker and father Jeremy Seifert seeks to convey the potential danger of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in our foods and the need for legislation requiring accurate labeling of such.</Review>
            <Review>The real truth is that GMO OMG...is merely the latest in a long line of one-sided agitprop documentaries. Far from an impartial investigation...Seifert's work is a monotonous censure that, in the absence of conclusive data, exploits fear.</Review>

            <Review>Unlikely to convert any skeptics, but if they wander into the multiplex, they'll find that that the prettily photographed sermon goes down easily.</Review>
            <Review>This is a big-tent Christian film that wriggles around a lot seeking to accommodate multiple varieties of religious experience, and ends up terminally infected with the virus of postmodern relativism.</Review>
            <Review>A well-acted, family-friendly and timely movie for Easter audiences that is just as much about appreciating life on Earth as it is about what comes after.</Review>
            <Review>There's no antagonist, no resolution, and no real climax - just a series of mildly charming scenes in which Colton shares heavenly knowledge while his family reacts with awestruck tears.</Review>
            <Review>Kinnear does an excellent job of capturing Burpo's obvious dilemma and the turmoil he and his wife endure as they work through this critical time in the life of their family.</Review>
            <Review>Whatever works.</Review>
            <Review>Highly recommended for those struggling with belief in spiritual realities.</Review>
            <Review>"Some people might be afraid to believe," Todd (Greg Kinnear) sighs at one point. The triumph of Heaven Is for Real is in the film's embrace of the very down-to-earth notion that such fear can lurk even in the hearts of those who have faith.</Review>
            <Review>It never strays far from preaching, leaving viewers no choice but to see Pastor Burpo primarily as an unreliable narrator.</Review>
            <Review>A smooth, easygoing film that will please its target audience, even if it doesn't quite reach the heavenly heights of other inspirational efforts in the faith-based genre.</Review>
            <Review>It's really just more numbing propaganda.</Review>
            <Review>Christians may shout hallelujah that faith-based films are arriving in theaters, but believers should pray for something much better.</Review>

            <Review>The world doesn't need another empty genre exercise. But as Blue Ruin reminds us, it can always use more filmmakers of Saulnier's resourcefulness, sensitivity and quiet assurance.</Review>
            <Review>With the same brand of realist irony the Coens used to cool down Blood Simple, writer-director Jeremy Saulnier slows the genre's heartbeat to gripping effect.</Review>
            <Review>Saulnier is also a cinematographer, and he's in complete control of the film's conflation of human-scale horror and tragicomedy.</Review>
            <Review>Blair, an unheralded actor, carries the whole picture. He's in practically every scene, and his performance is fascinating because in his eyes you can see the character struggling desperately with himself.</Review>
            <Review>Saulnier makes impressive use of silence and slow camera movements, allowing the suspense to simmer until violence seems practically inevitable.</Review>
            <Review>Saulnier spills a lot of blood, but he's an extraordinarily responsible and appealing craftsman.</Review>
            <Review>It's a dark film, with a sicko sense of humor, that's not for all tastes. But the talented director knows how to keep things tense, taut and exciting.</Review>
            <Review>Jeremy Saulnier's "Blue Ruin" is a small, quiet film brimming with smart directorial decisions.</Review>
            <Review>Even though at some points it hints at dark humor in a Coen brothers kinda way, this movie is far from making you laugh. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>Every shot in this film is carefully selected to bring the most out of this thrilling story. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>
            <Review>An umpredictable journey that manages to build up tension and interest the whole time. [Full review in Spanish]</Review>

            <Review>You don't so much care where Dom is going as how he's getting there, and he's getting there loud.</Review>
            <Review>"Dom Hemingway" has two terrific things going for it: snappy dialogue (I was quite fond of the accusation "You disrespected my cat") and Law, who's both funny and scary in equal measures.</Review>
            <Review>The title character of this florid crime comedy could be an escapee from a Tarantino script, all flashy character traits and verbal overkill.</Review>
            <Review>Dom Hemingway is often viciously funny, and every time you think the movie has run out of steam, Shepard spins things in a new direction, keeping the energy from flagging (including one of the most startling car crashes I've ever seen in a film).</Review>
            <Review>While Law bellows blasphemous poetry, his director orchestrates a noirish light show with a cockeyed rhythm.</Review>
            <Review>An angry and noisy romp that left this reviewer feeling cold.</Review>
            <Review>Always feels fake.</Review>
            <Review>The results are so delightful you can't help hoping Law lets his hairline recede and gym membership expire.</Review>
            <Review>Dom Hemingway lives or dies by the audience's identification with its protagonist.</Review>
            <Review>Jude Law gives a bravura performance as the title character, but you can't escape the feeling that this 2013 crime comedy-drama could have been either funnier or more dramatic.</Review>
            <Review>In his attempt to build a story around a two-dimensional character, writer/director Richard Shepard has ended up with a meandering mess of clichés that was in desperate need of some originality.</Review>

        <StoryLine>Love or Whatever is the story of Corey, a good-hearted guy who seems to have it all - a successful career as a therapist, an exuberant amount of charm and a pair of gorgeous engagement rings; ready to pop the question to his long-term, hot jock boyfriend. But, when his better half commits the ultimate betrayal and dumps him, Corey stumbles and fumbles through a wild and hilarious journey of self-discovery. Caught between his feisty, lesbian sister Kelsey and his hunky, smoldering new love interest Pete, and the hopelessly confused, "flexi-sexual" ex-boyfriend Jon, Corey is faced with a decision that could change his life forever.

            <Review>The moral here is that no challenge is insurmountable if you form a club. And keep a wine opener handy.</Review>
            <Review>In Tyler Perry's latest opus, "The Single Moms Club," he demonstrates how disparate stereotypes can find common ground through the power of a single cliché.</Review>
            <Review>[T]his is a film about catharsis and camaraderie, not logic.</Review>
            <Review>This is How Stella Got Her Groove Back for the Pop-Tart crowd, a wish-fulfillment weepie that narrowly clears Perry's low bar, thanks mostly to Wendi McLendon-Covey and Cocoa Brown</Review>
            <Review>Mr. Perry's latest film touches upon some recognizable and realistic challenges with efficient compassion, but there's probably more dramatic tension in a car pool than in this film's collection of predicaments.</Review>
            <Review>Just wondering, but if these sisters are indeed capable of doing it for themselves as the film insists, why can't at least one of them do it without a man?</Review>
            <Review>As frustrating as it is, Tyler Perry's The Single Moms Club is an insightful, fascinating and often entertaining picture.</Review>
            <Review>The title not only succinctly sums up the basic premise, but the totality of Perry's development of it.</Review>
            <Review>We see very little of the women's vicissitudes, or the ways in which they support one another through their club.</Review>
            <Review>A contrived, formulaic, heavy-handed melodrama about camaraderie and the value of female solidarity.</Review>
            <Review>This is the third feature within a year (on top of two TV shows) to come out of Perry's fast food, drive-thru productions. So it's not surprising that the Single Moms Club feels like it was slapped together by someone who is ready to take the next order.</Review>
            <Review>[...]Single Moms Club cannot muster up the energy to be as insulting and offensive [or] as overtly, aggressively sexist as most of Perry's films [but the film] feels suspiciously like a glorified pilot for a television show[...]</Review>

            <Review>Despite the essentially formulaic nature of the proceedings, the film does boast some nasty twists that prove galvanizing.</Review>
            <Review>By the time half the contestants have been offed you may be less interested in who will win than when it will all be over.</Review>
            <Review>Real suspense and shocks are MIA in a movie that's eventful but lacks the atmospherics needed to be scary.</Review>
            <Review>Though the dialogue is pretty basic and the narrative dots don't always quite connect, "The Human Race," in its own gutsy, grindhouse-movie way, manages style, vision and tension.</Review>
            <Review>The central gimmick is just another excuse to let the bloodletting commence in this low-budget thriller.</Review>
            <Review>Instead of a grandly ghoulish dash for survival, the movie revels in ghastly behavior with a mouthbreathing concentration that's as irritating as it is worthless.</Review>
            <Review>Most of the characters are either types or anonymous bodies in motion... but the handful with backstories are well played by a cast composed largely of actors with respectable and diverse TV and indie-movie credits.</Review>
            <Review>The Human Race, a dreary, smeary, low-low-budget but even lower-inspiration horror flick, is likely to leave viewers rueing the craven, disappointing species into which they were born.</Review>
            <Review>Utterly generic, but reasonably well-played and directed</Review>
            <Review>a bleak and often bloody portrait of humanity as a plaything for drives and forces beyond its comprehension or control.</Review>
            <Review>Filled with fine performances, splattery effects and an electrifying out-of-nowhere third-act twist that pushes Hough's feature debut into instant cult status.</Review>

            <Review>All Cheerleaders Die offers everything you'd expect from a horror flick with this title, but slow, bumpy pacing and underdeveloped characters make it ultimately forgettable.</Review>
            <Review>With all the finesse of a bullhorn that sprays noise and blood, "All Cheerleaders Die" shows just how difficult it is to pump life into the shopworn teen horror-comedy genre.</Review>
            <Review>Shot with a camera as excited as a squirrel-chasing dog, "Cheerleaders" has a girls-gone-wild energy and a twisted sense of humor.</Review>
            <Review>While there are some effective moments early on - especially when Maddy confronts star player Terry (a suitably charming yet threatening Tom Williamson) - [the film] sinks under the weight of predictable plotting and cheap special effects.</Review>
            <Review>All Cheerleaders Die began as a lo-fi video feature 13 years ago and weirdly, the inspirational rah-rah seemed to have stopped right there.</Review>
            <Review>This would-be cult movie looks the part, but has little going on inside.</Review>
            <Review>I applaud its take-no-prisoners mentality, accurately embellished teen clichés, and ability to elicit some chuckles.</Review>
            <Review>With all the makings of a future cult classic, All Cheerleaders Die is an infectiously fun, razor-sharp romp that feels right at home amongst its high school horror peers.</Review>
            <Review>A funny, smart, and subversive satire about the way women are often objectified in horror films. Only not boring, like that description is.</Review>
            <Review>As is often the best advice, rent Heathers instead.</Review>
            <Review>Young, far-from-dumb and full of comeuppances.</Review>

            <Review>What redeems all this, to some extent, is Ayer's bleak but honest vision... he understands how law-enforcement people witnessing the depths of humanity might lack the necessary character to climb back up.</Review>
            <Review>For most of its running length, Sabotage is a gritty, compelling motion picture with twists to make a pretzel envious. Unfortunately, it overstays its welcome.</Review>
            <Review>Sabotage starts off as a fun, nasty, occasionally surprising little piece of genre filmmaking. But it gradually loses the thread.</Review>
            <Review>Director David Ayer has made two of the best films about the tough lives of cops -- Training Day and End of Watch -- but his streak ends with the very violent and ultimately forgettable Sabotage.</Review>
            <Review>[an] ugly, abrasive and thoroughly charm-resistant bag of slop</Review>
            <Review>'Sabotage' contains the most graphic nastiness of any film Ah-nuld has ever made. It'll keep your attention, but you'll possibly lose your lunch and feel slimed.</Review>
            <Review>I's unfortunately weighed down by a plot that we've seen before and characters we care too little about.</Review>
            <Review>The kind of cathartic action pic that's been long absent, reminding us that gritty revenge pieces have their place.</Review>
            <Review>Arnie's macho crew are such an obnoxious bunch of meatheads - and that goes, too, for Mireille Enos, its lone women member - that you will struggle to care.</Review>
            <Review>Part heist film, part action thriller, part murder mystery, the movie is punishingly violent (in one scene, the camera lingers over squashed body parts after a drug agent is hit by a train). The ugliness is so pervasive it becomes perversely fascinating.</Review>
            <Review>...it becomes more and more clear that virtually all of the movie's protagonists are unlikable...</Review>

        <Title>Ehi amico... c'� Sabata, hai chiuso! (Sabata)</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 1968</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>106</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Spaghetti Western fans used to the likes of Django and The Good, The Bad and the Ugly might be taken by surprise when watching Sabata. True, the film does star spaghetti Western star Lee Van Cleef as the tight-lipped hero of the title, but it has a very different feel from the genre's traditional, Sergio Leone-derived style. Director/co-writer Gianfranco Parolini (alias Frank Kramer) takes things in a direction that seems to fall halfway between The Wild Wild West TV series and a James Bond movie; the film is packed with colorful characters, exotic weapons, and the action scenes that mix wild stunts with pyrotechnics. Parolini appropriately gives the film a light touch, playing up the colorful and humorous aspects while delivering the action. The end result is a little too long for this sort of light material, causing it to drag a bit in the middle, but it is too good-natured and entertaining to dislike. In short, Sabata is likely to make fun viewing for Euro-cult fans and anyone interested in an offbeat Western. ~ Donald Guarisco, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <ReleaseDate> 1954</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>93</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Sir James Barrie's whimsical play Rosalind was updated and urbanized as the 1953 film Forever Female. Ginger Rogers plays a veteran Broadway star who has optioned a play written by William Holden. Though on the less sunny side of 40, Rogers expects to play the leading role, that of a 19 year old girl. Producer Paul Douglas--who also happens to be Rogers' husband--insists that Holden alter the age of the main character. Meanwhile, iron-willed ingenue Patricia Crowley, who is far more suited to the part than Rogers, begins her own campaign to win the role. Far more enjoyable than the plot mechanics of Forever Female are the sly showbiz inside jokes, courtesy of screenwriters Julius and Philip Epstein. It's also fun to tick off the familiar faces in the supporting cast, including George Reeves as a stuffy suitor, future Mrs. Bing Crosby Katherine Grant as an auditioning actress, and Gunsmoke and Dragnet villain Vic Perrin as an effeminate set designer. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi</StoryLine>

        <StoryLine>Propaganda signals the birth of a new genre-bending generation of film maker.

In doing so, the film delivers a devastating blow to those who might be quick to laugh at 'backward' ideologies before considering how political and cultural trends have weakened Western claims to the moral high ground.

            <Review>An effective throwback to the loose-limbed, my-way-or-the-highway road movies of the "Easy Rider" era.</Review>
            <Review>None of this is riveting, but the film's loose naturalism and strong acting - Chris Browning, as a liaison between the F.B.I. and the reservation, is especially enjoyable - are slyly seductive.</Review>
            <Review>Momoa makes much of it work through sheer force of will as Wolf, a chopper-riding Native American hunted by venal lawmen and seeking his mother's killer.</Review>
            <Review>Road To Paloma features perhaps the most motorcycle-riding footage of any actor-directed vanity project since The Brown Bunny.</Review>
            <Review>This film is numbingly dull, an outlaw-on-the-run saga as laconic and slow-moving as its fierce, hirsute protagonist.</Review>
            <Review>Less a failure of competing or conflicting visions and more just a buffet of poorly executed meanderings.</Review>
            <Review>All the visceral cut and paste art can't fully form Momoa's story.</Review>
            <Review>... an earnest but formulaic story of redemption.</Review>
            <Review>(Director) Momoa progresses through the episodic plot with confident skill, although he may have had a few words with his leading man about easing back on the Rock-like charm (Wolf is murderer on the run, after all).</Review>
            <Review>Gritty, grim and uncompromising, Road to Paloma is an uncommonly thoughtful and thrilling ride, made all the better by Jason Momoa's magnetic screen presence.</Review>
            <Review>Retains a rich cinematic personality and satisfying performances, keeping just enough emotion on the front burner to help follow the hunt.</Review>
            <Review>A one-note on-the-lam saga that's primarily notable for its simplistic celebration of the outlaw life through endless shots of writer/director/star Jason Momoa in sunset silhouette.</Review>

        <Title>History Of The Eagles: Part 1</Title>
        <ReleaseDate/>
        <Duration>80</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Don Henley and Glenn Frey were a pair of journeyman musicians -- the former from Texas, the latter from Michigan -- who had been knocking around the Los Angeles music scene for a few years when they were hired to play in Linda Ronstadt's backing band. In 1971, they teamed up with two fellow members of Ronstadt's band, Randy Mesiner and Bernie Leadon, and signed a record deal with a new label being launched on the West Coast, with no inkling that by the end of the decade, they would be one of the biggest American bands of all time. The Eagles would go on to record two of the biggest selling albums of the 20th Century (Hotel California and Their Greatest Hits 1971-1975), redefine the trademark Los Angeles soft rock sound, and create a body of work that became an apt soundtrack for a nation looking to feel good again after the turmoil of the 1960s. Filmmaker Alison Ellwood offers an in-depth look at the early days of the Eagles and their rise to fame in the documentary History Of The Eagles -- Part One, which combines new interviews with the group's members and their associates, vintage photographs, and rare performance footage to tell the story of a band that came to define their time. Produced for the Showtime premium cable network, History of the Eagles -- Part One received its world premiere at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival; Part Two, not shown at the festival, made its cable premiere the same month as the first film.</StoryLine>

        <Reviews>
            <Review>The road to the finale is littered with dead bodies and red herrings, but Open Grave is more notable for its laid-back approach to storytelling than for its plot twists.</Review>
            <Review>Where the story leads is so disappointing-and hackneyed-it makes the entire journey feel like an enormous waste of time.</Review>
            <Review>The film's aura of mystery only works in the first 20 minutes or so, when it seems effortless; after that it feels like it's working very hard to keep the truth obscured, and in so doing just becomes a colorless slog.</Review>
            <Review>The film doesn't break any new ground, and with a few tweaks, it could have packed a far greater punch.</Review>
            <Review>Open Grave starts off well enough, but soon finds itself as lost and confused as its amnesiac characters.</Review>
            <Review>Stock characters in a poorly plotted zombie-apocalypse storyline jabbed with a ham-fisted musical score, "Open Grave" is an elementary horror movie geared to set the genre back 30 years.</Review>
            <Review>Decent payoffs for those who are interested in playing along -- and willing to contend with a few slow spots in the mid-section.</Review>
            <Review>It's a nifty what's-going-on-here? setup with loads of potential, all of which is sadly squandered.</Review>
            <Review>... another genre head-scratcher from López-Gallego, who last brought us 'Apollo 18' ... It won't impress the more literal-minded fans of 'World War Z' or 'The Crazies.'</Review>
            <Review>Perhaps next time a little more faith in the power of visuals and performance would do the trick. Anything but another 100 minutes of dull characters sharing their inner monologue would be preferable.</Review>
            <Review>Open Grave ends up merging Agatha Christie with 'The Last of Us,' with varying degrees of success.</Review>

            <Review>Minds will be blown to the four winds. And - fair warning - a percentage of American ticket buyers may find themselves exasperated and/or exiting early.</Review>
            <Review>Glacial in pace, skeletal in plot, and generally nasty, Jonathan Glazer's Under the Skin is a repetitive nightmare of drear and dread punctuated by moments of queasy-making horror.</Review>
            <Review>It's admirable that Johansson should be so willing to go off the Hollywood grid, but the truth is, "Under the Skin" would have been a lot better if it wasn't so excruciatingly arty.</Review>
            <Review>All this is initially fascinating, and then progressively less so.</Review>
            <Review>Most of Under the Skin operates on an almost subconscious level. The truth is out there in Glazer's screenplay, which he co-wrote with Walter Campbell, but it's intuitive rather than didactic.</Review>
            <Review>One of the most polarizing movies in recent years.</Review>
            <Review>Repetitive but creepy sci-fi horror flick likely to get under your skin.</Review>
            <Review>An exploration and subversion of the unstated theme of 'Species' and its ilk: the fear of female sexuality, and the fantasy scenarios that are all tied up in those fears.</Review>
            <Review>Like much of the imagery that follows, the opening segment is a sensory immersion into an experience beyond comprehension.</Review>
            <Review>Like so many classics, it works singularly across multiple genres (horror, science fiction, drama, thriller) but its beauty comes from all those elements working in concert.</Review>
            <Review>The premise is intriguing and it's only the possibility that something might come of it that keeps your attention, but that attention is never rewarded.</Review>
            <Review>A visionary, thought-provoking sci-fi masterpiece ...</Review>

            <Review>Bethlehem's plot is nothing new; it's the oft-told Cain and Abel story updated for the age of suicide bombers and tactical strikes, as a tautly structured mix of melodrama and ticking-clock thriller.</Review>
            <Review>Cinematographer Yaron Scharf shoots Bethlehem like a modern western, every grimace, twitch and drop of sweat playing in stark relief against an implacable landscape that has seen much spilled blood.</Review>
            <Review>The politics of "Bethlehem" are complex, but the relationship at its heart is simple: a kid who needs some kind of stability in his life, even if it comes from a most unlikely, and dangerous, place.</Review>
            <Review>A rich, multilayered character study cleverly garbed as an action thriller, Bethlehem is a searing critique of the conflict and its toll - not just in human lives, but also in two peoples' gradual, overall loss of humanity.</Review>
            <Review>Bethlehem remains a fairly powerful experience because so much of what we see is inflamed by a violence that seems to have no end.</Review>
            <Review>The story of a young Palestinian, pushed into informing by the Israeli secret police, and forced to navigate conflicting feelings of loyalty, betrayal, self-interest and revenge.</Review>
            <Review>The moral murkiness of the Israel-Palestine conflict sets the scene for a blistering espionage thriller.</Review>
            <Review>In the light of what has been happening in nearby Gaza, this small but memorable film assumes an even greater impact.</Review>
            <Review>Its most compelling element, however, is the relationship between informer and informant.</Review>
            <Review>The movie loses momentum when the strong central duo gets split up, undermining both the suspense and the emotional center of the story.</Review>
            <Review>Bethlehem negotiates a tangle of loyalties that's as complex as the Middle East itself.</Review>
            <Review>[The similar] 'Omar,' a recent Oscar nominee, is better directed, with assured long takes by an established talent, Hany Abu-Assad ('Paradise Now'). 'Bethlehem' has the better, cleaner script, and the best performance of the two.</Review>

        <Title>Northern Light</Title>
        <ReleaseDate> 2014</ReleaseDate>
        <Duration>105</Duration>
        <StoryLine>Set against the backdrop of a town's annual snowmobile race, NORTHERN LIGHT explores the working class experience in a series of captivating personal stories of recession-era America. The lives of three families change profoundly in the north woods of Michigan, where winters are unforgiving, jobs are hard to come by, and the line between living life and simply surviving is razor-thin. This cinematic, observational documentary explores the American working class experience through character- based storytelling. As racers and their families pin their hopes to a 500 mile-long test of endurance, small triumphs and giant sacrifices are made along the way. Dysfunction and hardship permeate the cold, but this harsh setting is simultaneously the site of community and familial intimacy. Filmed over the course of several years spent with the film's protagonists, NORTHERN LIGHT is a fresh and vital contribution to the tradition of contemporary American cin�ma v�rite.

            <Review>A sneakily compelling, endlessly patient observation of three working-class families in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.</Review>
            <Review>Rather than high drama, these are moments of plain being, a rare immersion into the everyday lives of strangers.</Review>
            <Review>"Northern Light" can be monotonous.</Review>
            <Review>You feel as though you've been given the keys to a town that trusts you to look around at your own pace and turn off the light on your way out. And the longer you stay, the less you feel like leaving.</Review>
            <Review>The film has an atmosphere of endless experimentation, which compliments the constant revision the subjects apply to their lives in the wake of their economic insecurity.</Review>
            <Review>Gets past the Joe Six-Pack, NASCAR fan stereotypes and shows you how ordinary working class people work and play. Given the deepening class divisions in the USA, a film that illuminates how people survive psychologically.</Review>

            <Review>The movie has one goal: to amuse the most children with the least amount of effort.</Review>
            <Review>The musical moments, on the whole, stand out as the highlights of the film; Rio 2 becomes watchable when the flat characters shut up and sing.</Review>
            <Review>Rio 2 has a childish, delicious-looking beauty. It's like watching a box of Froot Loops explode just beyond the tip of your nose. Bring milk.</Review>
            <Review>Where the film excels ... in an even more pronounced way than the first film, is in the choreographed animation for the musical numbers.</Review>
            <Review>"Rio 2" ends up being not so much about the birds as mostly for the birds.</Review>
            <Review>It'll keep the kids content for a couple of hours, though it's likely to bore the grown-ups.</Review>
            <Review>Not surprisingly, what was a colorful, featherweight lark the first time around sags on re-entry due to sloppy familial baggage.</Review>
            <Review>If Rio showed that 20th Century Fox Animation had finally moved into Disney's neighborhood, with Rio 2 they've taken off their shoes and propped their feet up on the coffee table.</Review>
            <Review>The plot struggles to take wing at first, but Eisenberg is very funny as the fretful, accident-prone Blu.</Review>
            <Review>I'm endlessly frustrated at not being able to have entertainment without a side of political and social preaching. Still, Rio 2 is a cute enough movie.</Review>
            <Review>I enjoyed it while I was watching it.</Review>
            <Review>Rio 2 is fine for what it is, but it's yet another film filling the market with the same kind of movie.</Review>

            <Review>Rare is the "cartoon" that penetrates and even haunts; Wrinkles is not easily forgotten.</Review>
            <Review>Unfolding in simple yet wonderfully expressive hand-drawn frames, the film's unsparingly observant plot depicts the slide into senility with empathy and imagination.</Review>
            <Review>Wrinkles doesn't offer the aesthetic rewards necessary to make its sad material compelling.</Review>
            <Review>Heavy doses of humor and empathy, along with gorgeous hand-drawn animation, keep things from getting too morbid.</Review>
            <Review>A beautiful, subtle horror movie about the rigors of old age, made all the more horrifying because it will happen to all of us fortunate enough to live a long life.</Review>
            <Review>The film doesn't wallow in grief; it's a thoughtful and nuanced portrait of a stage of life we often choose not to see.</Review>
            <Review>With its wry moments and poetic interludes, this is a film that takes its time, though time is all the old-age home's residents have. But it's the mixture of melancholy, wistfulness, and ennui here that makes the headiest, heartiest cocktail.</Review>
            <Review>Literally dedicated to "all the old people of today, and of tomorrow," this animated look at aging is deeply humanistic, immensely moving, often hilarious and quite, quite wonderful.</Review>
            <Review>In its visionary dream and flashback sequences, the film becomes a comment on the rapidly diminished state of traditional animation.</Review>
            <Review>Lots to love here, but it's all perhaps a little soft.</Review>
            <Review>Wrinkles is a nuanced, rich look at human frailty and the beauty of life, alternating between frank and tenderly humane notes with perfect precision, making the conventional beats its story does hit genuinely poignant.</Review>
            <Review>A charming production, poignant and tender and one that is bound to move and compel you - while remaining so effortlessly subtle throughout.</Review>
